"Seeing the doctor soon. Skateboard accident, toes are swollen. I‚Äôm scared for the results."
We will find out if your a weakling
I am strong after all
"Surely a true strongbone would not be scared for the results.
Stay strong of bone, brother."
I‚Äôm side-eyeing you.
"Swollen toes normally means a sprain if memory serves, however, i may be wrong. Either way don't fear for the potential of weak bones. Strong bones must be reinforced further with an iron will."
"yeah, I damaged my tendons/ligaments. Pretty painful, but they're healing quickly"
"If your bones truly belong here, you'd know that you needn't be scared brother.
God speed on your healing if your bones are in tact."
I'm no doctor but I reckon wind resistance from the hairy legs was probably the real culprit here.
"It was a new electric skateboard I bought, so my fleecy legs stood no chance"
Whats the update? Broke or not broken?
not broken! Just a pulled tendon
Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/Neverbrokeabone/comments/yeje3f/update_i_am_still_strong_dont_mind_the_grippers/
"As title, stacked it on the skateboard only 2 weeks after getting new 6a :("
"Screen on top is in tact, the glass on the rear is fine too - its just the lcd thats broken."
"I'm in Sydney Aus, how can get this fixed/replaced? Is there something through Google or do I need to do an ""ifixit"" solution?"
"There is no LCD.
But I get what you mean. There are usually pixel replacement parts on ifixit, but I can't find Pixel 6a parts yet."
UPDATE: able to take it back to jbhifi and have it replaced on the spot for free :)

"Visiting the psychiatric ward for being sad, turns out my brain is turning to mush from an old skateboard accident ten years ago. Oops. Wear a helmet kids."
damn... this makes me wonder if my sadness is mush brain related
"Brains are both incredibly durable and incredibly fragile. It can be easy to damage it in the long term from simple trauma, recreational drug and alcohol use, and even just localization environmental polution like heavy metals"

And there was a friend of a friend flat ground in a park just messing around doing kick flips and shit, he fell just the right way hit his head and died then and there. Show your bf this.

My Brother got in a skateboarding accident and broke his ankle in three places. Any messages for him before he goes in for surgery?
What brother
I second this
"Lmao, ruthless."
"Three places? There's being a weak-boned bitch and there's being someone so pathetic they need to be put in a bubble like some kind of pet hamster. Your brother skated over that line about two miles ago, best of luck tho"
Remind him that you are the superior skeleton
Oh trust me I will as soon as he wakes up from surgery. How utterly weak and embarrassing to be related to this deformity
Is he though? He has the same pathetic genes. He has just been wrapped in bubble wrap his whole life.
"Never go back to those three places
Ba-dum tssshhh
Thank you thank you I'm here all week

Ahwatukee teen in the ICU after electric skateboard accident at ASU
Electric scooters/skateboards freak me out. Couple that with the fact almost no one wears a helmet with those or bikes is a disaster waiting to happen.
"I don't think anything motorized (besides the DART and landscaping carts) should be on any path on campus. Like you said, it's a disaster waiting to happen. I do wish them a speedy recovery though."
"Yeah I'm not a fan of the electric skateboards. Few years ago I watched someone eat shit on one after smacking into another student who was walking and looking at their phone.
Also, people fly as fast as they can down the paths in Tempe, this was inevitable."
"I don‚Äôt think the scooters are too bad, given how they have breaks, the skateboards from what I can tell don‚Äôt really have breaks. I personally drive a small scooter around campus, going around 10 mph because no one needs to be going 20+ on campus, but I always wear a helmet and I‚Äôve never hit or had a close call with someone ever. I‚Äôve been hurt more by other scooter riders as a pedestrian. I always see people wiping out or hurting others with electric skateboards. I‚Äôll bet they‚Äôll get banned soon.
People always wear their damn headphones/AirPods too, pedestrians included, so no one hears a goddamn thing until it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôve had scooter/skateboard riders completely cut me off while I‚Äôm walking and I‚Äôm amazed at how they just don‚Äôt seem to care or don‚Äôt even realize it."
"Just gonna point out the phrase from the article ""took it for a ride without a helmet"".
I hope the kid's okay but let's be real: this is one of the best examples of play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
Indeed. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt lead to a Darwin Award.

"Need advice, traumatic skateboard accident along with my poor decisions have lead me to a debt crossroads"
"So I'm sure you guys get these similar stories about hardship, credit cards, and loans. I am not here for pity or for a lecture about how horrible i am with money. I just have a handful of questions that are too specific to find answers without calling some places or asking here. Thanks.Sorry this ended up being very long, you can skip to the end for my question if your actually interested in giving me some advice, which i greatly appreciate!"
"So..... I'm not great with money, i make bad decisions. I buy expensive audio and recording equipment that i probably shouldn't own. I wasn't in debt but i had myself set up for disaster. i have a $400 car payment, 400$ rent, another $300 between phone and insurance, at least another $300 in misc subscriptions and bills from Sweetwater, and about 3 months ago i decided to finance a new Martin D28, that's about $250 a month. I make about 2.2k a month after taxes, so I was already stretched thin but i always pay all of my bills and keep my 3 credit cards paid off."
"In august I had gotten back into skateboarding after a few year hiatus, I'm 31. it was a great way to exercise for me. Then one day just cruising i managed to fuck up really bad, i fell and somehow shattered my pelvis and broke my Acetabulum, i had to get a major surgery and they had to basically screw me back together, yay!"
"Its now Nov, i still cant walk, but am lucky that I'm am essential to the operation of the business i work for so as soon as it happened my boss gave me a couple hundred bucks and let me do some work from home but it was only bringing in about $300 a month, not good. I went back to work after about a month and a half. I'm now making a lot less because I'm not able to work as much. I'm making about 1600 a month now but that will slowly change back to what i was making. During the time i wasn't able to work i had to use all of my available credit to pay my bills, luckily i have a wonderful fiance who paid for all of my food and whatnot, but i still racked up about 6k in cc debt, now its very difficult for me to catch up, all of my CCs are maxed and late. My bank account is negative all the time and I'm barley managing my car payment which I've prioritized as well as my insurance and phone. My credit score dropped from close to 700 to around 500 in that short time. Im also becoming a burden to my wonderful fiance who has already had to basically wipe my ass for a few months, i hate that, but am lucky to have her. Luckily my 100k in medical bills was completely wiped out through a charity type financial assistance program, thank god! Not having insurance really worked out in this scenario."
I'm extremely grateful for how this turned out honestly with the medical bills and my poor financial decisions i should be in a much much worse position. I completely understand that and am not trying to make anyone feel sorry for me in any way i feel extremely lucky. I honestly feel guilty that I have people who care and so many things went right at a time when so many people are so less fortunate.
"So, all three of my cards are stupid high interest 20+% APR, The minimum payments plus interest is too much for me to handle right now. After a few months of getting paid i can get back to being ok but its going to take me selling some gear and eating cheap, i already have listed a few expensive items on Reverb. I was looking into consolidating, the options on KreditKarma are a fucking joke, my credit score being so low is probably the reason. The options are all like 25% 30% APR and my car as collateral, i don't know who would actually fall for that. My question, finally, sorry, is....... Is there a better place i could go and say get a 5k lower interest loan with my car as collateral, i would assume putting my car up would drop the interest down to a reasonable 5-10%, is that ignorant of me? i know nothing about finances, obviously. Also, if that is a possibility, do you think it would be a good idea considering my circumstances? I just hate paying hundreds of dollars to these companies for basically nothing. In an ideal situation i could get a 5k loan with low interest and pay it off in a year or two and avoid all of these damn interest charges every month, they are really crippling my progress. I also do not want to have to sell my beloved guitars and gear but i am willing to do that if necessary, i just would lose a lot and end up never being able to replace the guitars, the two i have were 3k+ back before all of the online taxes and wood importing fees. In todays market they would be closer to 5k but it would take me years to sell them at a similar price., which i don't want to do, they are my favorite things in the world. Also, i tried returning the D28 that i bought a month before my accident and they were not having it because in my crippled state i accidentally knocked a heavy item into it cosmetically damaging it, it was a bad fucking month."
"Thanks for anyone who actually read this and is helping me figure out what to do, no matter what i know ill be fine, I just don't want to make any more poor decisions that lead me to a place where I'm actually fucked, THANKS!"
"So, basically, you are borrowing the value of your guitars and other gear at 20%+ / annual interest, something like that. You could largely eliminate the debt if you sell the gear, but you say you don't want to. That's a choice.
I'm not quite sure how you would think you would get another loan on your car if you already have a car payment."
"OP - glad you‚Äôre on the road to recovery, sorry this happened. Do you have a retirement fund you can tap into?
Everyone else. TL;DR - make sure to have an emergency fund. This is why‚Ä¶."
"Sounds like a good place to start is a nonprofit, legit credit counselor.
https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0153-choosing-credit-counselor
If you already got help with the medical bills, does the social worker or anyone from the hospital have a referral to someone?"
I‚Äôm sorry that happened. If I were you i would try to sell anything that could get me cash in order to pay off the payments w the highest interest ratings first. This might mean your car and guitar but it will reduce your debt by thousands and save you hundreds every month. I would also cancel any subscriptions. I have Netflix and Spotify so that would have to go. Dave Ramsey has a good program to help people w high CC debt called the Debt Snowball. I recommend watching some of his YouTube vids. Best of luck!

James and Aleks joking about James' skateboard accident in Gta RP
James' laugh is the thing I missed the most once he left Cow Chop. It's so contagious yet bully-ish. Great they are joking about CC now.
Yup i bet aleks was laughing his ass off too shame he wasn't streaming at the time
is aleks‚Äô crim character new? i‚Äôm new to gtarp don‚Äôt fight me.
It's not new he is just now starting to play it a little more regularly. His old crim characters were Sergei and Vasily which he doesn't play anymore and His current main character is Bobby Smith (chief of police)
I‚Äôm glad we can all laugh about this at the end of the day..a sad laugh..but a laugh
Goddamn I wish these two would start a channel of just them......
"I have a lot of hope that Aleks and James will remedy their friendship sometime in the future, unless that friendship is already fixed that we‚Äôre unaware of. A lot of The Creatures still talk to each other occasionally after years of them disbanding and some like Ze and Gassy even stream/do YT videos together. If the beauty gurus of YT can start drama about each other, stop being friends, then eventually awhile after become friends again, then I‚Äôm sure James and Aleks will. We just have to wait and see."
‚ÄúSounds pretty fucking relatable man‚Äù too good
this is the content we needed right now
haha halfpipe. never forget.
Ahhh
So they are still cool? I thought everyone was saying James and Aleks had beef or something
People are fucking dumb and just say shit for drama. They are clearly not friends anymore but don't have any sort of beef or disdain for each other. For the last month or so whenever they have come across each other they have interacted pretty well.
People freaked out when I think Brett or someone said they hadnt spoken in months.

"The story starts when i was going down a street with my skateboard and tried to do a trick, the board went into the street (which is a busy street i might add) it went under the wheel of an uncoming car, didn't break, flipped like 2 meters in the air, and fell on the window of the taxi driver, made a crack about the size of a baseball glove on the passenger side, he stopped in the middle of the street and i went back"
"I thought about running for it, but something stopped me, i gave him my facebook and my phone, and he told me he would call me tommorow and he added me as a friend. Today is the next day, and i dont know if i have to pay for it all, if his insurance will pay it, is it my fault? Or anything of any legal matter"

"NAL, but in most countries I'd say yes, it's your fault. It was your skateboard that fell into the street, and by the story I've understood that it could've easily killed someone. It is your responsibility to not let your skateboard get away in the middle of a busy street.
As far as money goes, you'll most likely have to pay for the repair of the windshield, since it was your fault. But since you were nice and did the right thing giving the driver your contact info, he might try to see if his insurance pays for the repair ( being a taxi driver, it's very likely, but I would not recommend rely on this). Wait until he contacts you and everything will be fine."
Your personal liability insurance will cover it.
"Be prepared to pay. If you have any liability insurance or car insurance of your own, you could possibly go through them as long as the deductable (the amount you pay) is less than the new windshield and your rates won't change. I'm not sure exactly how your insurance, if you have it, works, but those are standard things to look out for.
If you don't go through an insurance company, do your research. Find out from a reputable source how much the windshield should cost. Ask for receipts. Make sure the amount of money the driver is asking for is reasonable and legit. If not, you may want to consider getting a lawyer or going through some sort of arbiter.
The good news is that the cost shouldn't be impossible to cover. For a regular car I'd expect 500 euro to be a high end estimate (based on a quick Google that gave me info from the USA, so maybe a bit higher depending on tax?). It's a common thing and the service shouldn't be a premium charge."

"""So sad. RIP Noah.
His friend posted this on social media:
Yesterday evening, my friend went out for a short ride on his Meepo mini, he didn‚Äôt have a helmet on.
I wasn‚Äôt there but he was going fast and got speed wobbles, he fell off at around 25 MPH and landed directly on his head. His skull cracked completely open and was rushed to the near by hospital where he was in surgery for about 10 hours.
He suffered a major injury to his brain stem and unfortunately didn‚Äôt make it through the night.
Wear your helmets boys and girls, it‚Äôs not worth the risk."""
"That friend posted that on this sub yesterday or the day before.
Sucks."
Unfortunately people not wearing a helmet is going to bring a bad name to eboarding. This is a very unfortunate example of that. R.I.P Noah
We've only been crying for it for decades in longboarding
"Wow 25 MPH on a Meepo Mini... I get scared at 20 MPH on my WOWGO s2 with a helmet.
RIP dude"
Reasonably scared it turns out
so 3 fatal accident in a month. That is just scary.
"It's not just skateboarding -- rollerblading, electric skateboarding, longboarding, even biking (to a lesser degree) all have an image problem with the helmet and safety gear. It's really hard to convince people to wear their safety gear if they've never had a crash and/or none of their peers wear safety gear.
Now, once you've had a crash or there's been a crash in your riding group, everyone realizes that it *could* happen to them and they need to take this shit seriously.
I had never had a crash of any significance but I've read the horror stories and had people around me that encouraged the wearing of helmets rather than made fun of me (as a kid). And, even though I hadn't had any serious falls, any skateboarder will tell you that falling is part of the sport. You're going to fall. And, I've had many falls that start to make you realize how quickly something bad can happen.
Luckily for me, I was wearing a helmet the day that I got speed wobbles at about 25mph earlier this year. There is no doubt in my mind that my helmet either saved my life or saved me from a serious brain injury. I was thrown forward and my head ended up snapping back with the back of the helmet hitting the ground. I really shudder to think of where I would be today (if anywhere) if I hadn't been wearing a helmet.
As it was, I almost certainly had a concussion and was in a fog for the next 8-10 hours. I bought an even better helmet afterward (but hung on to my lifesaver) and will *never* ride anything without a helmet. I wish I could somehow convey this feeling to kids to make them understand the risk they are taking. For vanity? Fuck that. This is your life."
Thanks for sharing.
Very sad. From the description of the accident it really does sound like a helmet could've been the difference between a really bad crash you walk off and dying.
"Bro I see people mobbin thinking there so cool without a helmet and every time I think just wait g your time will come lmao everybody crashes don‚Äôt matter how good of a skater you think you are it‚Äôs bound to happen. Pad up, helmet up so what if it looks like your going into battle lmao just roll with it."
"so what if it looks like your going into battle
Actually one of the best perks lmao. I love my armoured jacket. Get gear you love and feel like an indestructible badass whenever you want."

I'm glad you're ok too. My girlfriend dropped me off to get covid tested that morning and saw you while she was waiting for me in her car. She was really worried about you and would have helped but there were already mad people with you.

"She saw the end of it. She didn't know you got hit by a car until I showed you her your post. Until we saw the post we both just thought that you had fell from your skateboard. I didn't really see anything, by the time I saw anything you were getting into a car."

I was lucky to find one last week, and i just took a nasty fall backwards on my board and hit my head hard on the pavement. Thank God for this helmet"
"In case you weren‚Äôt aware, helmets are not meant for multiple impacts. Please get another one ASAP as the structural integrity of that one is now compromised and will not protect you the same as it could before."
"Sad that a man lost his life but...
why is the coroner writing to transport etc about it, the man wasn't wearing a helmet and was drunk, sadly his own neglect contributed to loss of life, not because of the electric skateboard."
Because England is the quintessential nanny state?
"Agreed. Let's regulate the hell out of esk8d and e-scooters because 1 person died.... Meanwhile, how many people died by car? And do they talk about it?"
"Title should read ""Man under the influence of alcohol..."""
"Sure and then they want to make it even more illegal , come on. They should ban alcohol or driving all together!!!"
"Note to self, don't go past 20 MPH, while drunk and wearing no safety gear."
I still have scars from the time I fell off an uber scooter last year
Tragic
"""But I'm not going to turn around and say people can't use them, because he took great enjoyment from it."""
"How stupid rider, stupid attitude will impact by new shit laws all people's who ride carefully and geared with protection! The guy is a Dad with children, and he didn't know it's dangerous with alcohol and no helmet on his board?
His wife statement is clearly childish and....stupid.
It hurts to have her husband, their dad in the tomb, it's heartbreaking, but don't reject the fault on the law? It's common sense."
"How is she childish and stupid? Woman lost her husband and father of her children. You expect her to be rational? Come on, be reasonable, don't call her stupid. Also she said exactly this to follow up:
""But I'm not going to turn around and say people can't use them, because he took great enjoyment from it.""
Sounds like a great woman to me."

"I once got a into a serious skateboarding accident, I lost all memories of the fall, didn't break a bone."
Jackson was with a group of 6+ people and they all decided to go to what we call ‚Äúdevils hill‚Äù from the skatepark. The hill is about 3/4 of a mile if not a mile from the skatepark and Josh and I would only go down half of it because of it‚Äôs intimidation. Colin went down first without incident and came back up. Then Jackson went next and wasn‚Äôt so lucky. Jackson hit a speed of what seemed to be 30 mph before hitting a rock.
"He landed on his elbows, giving himself whiplash and slid about 20ft on the asphalt of the golf cart path before sliding off the path and to the side. I later there anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute before Josh came down next, found him, and tried alerting the group. He started waving his hands and jumping, but the message he was trying to send was unclear to the group so he ran up to the top of devils hill and told them Jackson was not ok and that the cops and his parents needed to be notified putting his senior year of high school on hold."
"Colin made the calls and about 5 minutes later, the paramedics drove an ambulance down and loaded him into it to go to the soccer fields where the helicopter was waiting. Joey and Colin both got Jackson‚Äôs chromatic glasses, wallet, car keys, and phone. When the ambulance drove him to the soccer fields, he was loaded inside the helicopter for a life flight."
"He was taken to the ICU at Grady hospital in Georgia and was determined to have brain swelling, three hematoma‚Äôs, and a skull with 2/3 of it fractured. He was prepared for brain surgery to reduce the swelling, however one doctor suggested pumping his body with sodium. So the doctors did just that. The brain swelling went down and he avoided the brain surgery. He did however, have to stay in the icu for about 4 more days for rehydration. After that was complete, he went through rehab at the shepherd center in Atlanta before being released into the world again."
"He was out of shepherd in 2 weeks and had his first speech, physical, and occupational therapy appointments a month from his release at shepherd. He went in for those appointments and they told him he had no reason to need it. He is still recovering but still has a long way to go with his cognitive recovery"

30 god damn years 3 car crashes fallen from a moving horse multipul skateboarding accidents and many a toe stubbing still no bones have broken not even a stress fracture üí™ü¶¥
Welcome!
üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"I fell off my electric skateboard yesterday because the backwheels blocked. I fell on my back with full speed (35kmh) and hit my head on the floor. I had a loud ringing sound in my ears, was a bit dizzy and lost my ability to smell and taste after the hit. I went to the hospital right away and they made some tests. No concussion! I'm on painkillers right now and still got some neck and head pain. This happend yesterday and i still can't smell or taste wich makes me a bit anxious. Would love to hear some advice or tips what i can do or if someone had a same problem did your ability to smell came back?"
"I'm so sorry you're going though this! I did the same thing over 20 years ago, back of head, etc... Still can't smell. Was told at the time that either the olfactory portion of my brain was damaged or the nerves that connect to the brain from the receptors in the nose were severed. In either case, not a good prognosis. I hope you fare better! I have heard stories of people getting it back!"
"same thing happened to me, was holding onto the back of an electric scooter on my board, speed wobble and i slammed hit my head and fractured my skull. lost my sense of smell and taste, they told me they weren‚Äôt worried and it would come back. it‚Äôs been a year and a bit, i still don‚Äôt have it. glad you‚Äôre okay though! i have faith it‚Äôll come back, you got this homie!"
"I had a very similar accident where I hit the back of my head on the floor and lost my sense of smell. I am still healing 7 months later with no sense of smell. I damaged the nerves in the process. I definitely recommend seeing a specialist like I did. He/she can read MRI data and give you some info. They normally tell me that you can lose your sense of smell like this for about a year. Beyond that is normally permanent. But don't take my word for it, see a specialist"
"Sorry you're dealing with this, I hope it improves! I lost mine after a car accident, but didn't immediately realize it. I did not fully lose my sense of taste but it had decreased. Didn't see a doctor about the loss of smell until about a year later. He suggested it was due to shearing of olfactory nerves at the cribriform plate. I was told there was a possibility for the nerves to regenerate and form new connections and that I may regain my smell, but that if that does happen it could take years. He also said if I were to regain my sense of smell it would most likely be in the first 5 or so years and that if it had not improved in the first 10 years it would be unlikely to ever happen.
I'm at about 13 years later and don't seem to have regained much, if any, sense of smell. Over time I've actually become a bit more sensitive to some things, like the taste of vinegar. Sometimes I think I catch whiffs of smells, but if I don't have someone to check with I'm never sure if it was real or not. My body did compensate in one way, I either developed or heightened an ability to somewhat taste the air and detect qualities in the air that I can somewhat link to odors. Some of this is probably linked to 'smelling' things that trigger a response from the trigeminal nerve like vinegar, alcohol, menthol type things and some chemicals. It is definitely not a strong ability (for example I have a difficult time differentiating between eucalyptus and minty/menthol products), but I seem to be more sensitive than others to certain things - like a musty room."
I have seen several times that controllers lose connection and cause an accident. I have 3 questions:
How likely are you able to recover from a disconnect to prevent an accident?
"No one can answer this question as no board is the same.
I could tell you my DIY has not disconnected after 1000+ miles but it means nothing to you.
Also, it really depends on how the esc is configured to operate during a disconnect. You can have it set to default to full brake for example. Imagine that while you're going 30 mph?
Not all boards operate the same in these scenarios and not all boards are built with the same electronics"
"Thank you, I don't even have a board yet, so your general answer really helps.
Having it brake, wow who in the world would ever consider that a good idea?"
"Agreed- Very hard to say but it does happen. 2yrs riding Evolve Bgtr and I‚Äôve had 3 disconnects (no wheels locking, just the jolt and free roll) in the same spot near my home- I think from braking with 100% battery. I now run it down to 95ish% - no disconnects anymore."
"Never had a disconnect due to board error, but my own stubborness trying to make it up a hill on one bar left on the eskate. On one bar, the eskate was very jerky, less braking power, delayed input. As I was leaning forward and crawling up the hill, I lost power briefly at the top, and I did a weird split with one foot on the deck still haha.
Don't ignore the ""low voltage"" warnings on the remote. Switch to the slowest speed mode, or walk up the hills to save some battery when you are on the last bar."
I've also been wondering what happens when you take a hill higher than the advertised incline. I'm guessing it does something similar to this. Thank you for your insight!
"Diy disconnect experience checking in - make sure that all your receiver connections are hot glued or secured so they don‚Äôt bite, short, or come loose causing a d/c. It was more user error/learning curve on my part. LEARN TO FOOTBRAKE. The ground is not soft no matter how much more comfortable it looks than your current speed."
"Do not buy a meepo board they have terrible quality, the board randomly shut off one day as i was spiraling into traffic expecting to be able to break."
"I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say Meepo is a bad brand, might have just been a bad experience, I owned my V3 for an entire year before switching to Lacroix and never had any issues"
"About 600 miles between a boosted mini and a revel kit for me, no disconnects. I live in rural/suburbs though and I wonder if more people/devices in a city is a factor."
Ah good to know Revel don‚Äôt suffer disconnects. I‚Äôm looking for a kit that‚Äôs easy to swap decks. I‚Äôve seen quite a number of Evolve with this problem.
My backfire g3 controller has only ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù once and i still could control the throttle and brakes. (Tbf i did jump into a mighty puddle)
"I havent had a disconnect yet. 5k miles on my wowgo 3x. Had a backfire, exway, and meepo before this. No issues."
"May have been said but I'd always make sure to ride no faster than you can traditionally skate brake, ie a foot slide. I've had 6 eboards and a couple remotes die mid transit. But realistically any big name consumer board has next to no real issues in mass production and just odd issues for a single boards here and there. But I can't stress enough how many injuries occur to those who have never skated normally or haven't in years and go ahead and zip off at 25 to get stopped by a single rock or crack and break an arm."
"Rode a Backfire zealot for 300 miles, no disconnections whatsoever. Made a diy with a vesc and flipsky vx1, and at 25 miles on the odo it has lost connection around 10 times Reconnecting took 3 seconds or so which is way more than enough to get you in big trouble"
"My DIY uses a mini RC transmitter and reciever, and upon loss of connection my board goes full throttle. In terms of how often that happens not very, and I don't believe it's ever happened due to an error as such, more the fact that the controller starts to turn itself off momentarily when it gets low on battery. This hasn't yet caused an accident, as i've noticed the sudden full throttle blips and gotten off real quick.
However earlier this year for a reason still unknown to me the drive on my board locked up at 20mph. Could've been a board error, might've been a stone in the belt or under the wheel, i'm not sure, but I faceplanted and went sliding down a much busier road than I should've been riding. I was very lucky not to be ran over by a truck but knowing that it could've been a board error has reeaally dented my confidence as i'm always paranoid it'll happen again."
"My DIY uses a mini RC transmitter and receiver, and upon loss of connection my board goes full throttle.
You can set the failsafe on that controller. Most set it to neutral.
https://forum.esk8.news/t/how-to-bind-the-mini-remote-serious/95"
Could have been a full disconnect from the board and not just a momentary disconnect. You could possibly try this by spinning up the motors with the board upside down and powering off the remote or making it lose signal for an extended period of time to see if thats what caused it to lock up.
"If you're a skater you worry a lot less about these things. Got a discord setup BTW that's kind of begginer focused and more about just cruising and exploring if you're interested?
But yeah little real skill and some techniques to slow yourself down and you'll be better prepared to deal with it. It's rare but not unheard of. I've had my power button wiggle itself off on rough ground a couple times which amounts to the same thing."
"Mostly only because of heavy interference or damage to the remote or esc. It's rare but we hear so much about them because when it happens, everybody posts it here, nobody comes to this sub to post his remote works flawlessly
Depends when it happens, and what does your board do when it happens, some boards keep rolling, some start braking slowly and some jam the brakes a 100% (looking at you evolve)

James sings with broken hand due the skateboarding accident ‚Ä¢ Summer 1986
"Iirc, he hurt himself again skateboarding and the band missed playing SNL, so management put a no skateboarding clause in the contract."
Lmao
I remember reading in the Puppets book that the first show where James was back on guitar after this was the last show Cliff ever played
What book is this?
Fukin legend
Who was playing guitar?
John Marshall
"Scott Ian was initially asked to be the rhythm guitarist until Hetfield's wrist healed. They ended up going with John Marshall instead.
Scott Ian said he was extremely keen to do it, but he had other obligations."
Was he Caught in a Mosh?
Got the Glenn look going on.
Didn't they have to bail on SNL over this too?
"That‚Äôs what they said up top, but I dont understand, they obviously kept playing‚Ä¶."
That‚Äôs Chris Jericho like 5-6 years ago isn‚Äôt it?
Looking a little chubby there lol
Help me out I can't seem to get this window open. Nevermind it's open.
The singer of my hardcore band and one of my best friends was hospitalized after a traumatic skateboard accident. He has extensive brain damage and will take 2 years to recover. Please consider donating to our GoFundMe or sharing the link wherever you can! (Details on the site) Long Live HardCore!
"Wishing all the best for your homie, and don‚Äôt forget that a singer with brain damage always has a career as a bass player!"
That photo is sick! You got bandcamp? I would love to hear your band
"the debut album and some singles are on spotify, the name is Plumber ! we were about to record another EP before he got hurt :("
Hope he pulls through!!! Had a friend with a brutal skull injury a few years back and we thought we were gonna lose him but he's still around kicking ass and playing music. Good vibes to your band mate
"thanks dude , he‚Äôll probably be okay eventually but it‚Äôs hard to think about how much work and time and money it‚Äôll take to get him close to how he was."

Anyone have experience with road rash? I got into a skateboard accident going fast downhill during June. Any tips or advice for what to do or if it will go back to normal?
"It's scar tissue more than likely it'll stay with you for the next two years, and if you're not lucky am I stay with you for the rest of your life. But don't worry it's not going to be a life-threatening, I have scars from 10 years ago that still haven't healed but they haven't caused any problems."
I appreciate the help. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs really noticeable and I just been insecure about it and I wanted to hear some advice on if it might go away or if there‚Äôs anything I could do. But thank you so much for commenting!
"Wow, that must have hurt."
I got into a bad skateboarding accident maybe 6 weeks ago and now feel incredibly nervous when on my board
"So basically, i had an incident where i landed on my leg, twisted it nearly 90 degrees, and tore my hamstring. I'm starting to feel good enough to skate again and attempted to last night. But I felt an incredible amount of anxiety and nausea everytime I was about to push off. Anyone know techniques to rebuild confidence?"
"If your hamstring is telling you to stop, then stop. If anxiety is telling you to stop then get back on that board.
Take baby steps to rebuild that confidence.if you don't get back on it now it's going to get harder and harder to get back on it down the line.
First thing I do if I fall on a trick, if I haven't seriously hurt myself, is try the exact same trick again."
Thanks a lot. My hamstring is feeling fine for the most part. I just need to push myself to getting back to comfort
"I'd say just take it slow but keep skating as much as possible.
How'd you do it anyway?"
"basically my foot caught in the wheel as i was pushing myself forward and kinda got stuck on the floor. my board kept going, pulling my other leg as it went. This forced me into a split, and then I lost my balance, fell, and twisted my left leg nearly 90 degrees."
"Just start from square 1. Push around, feel the board under your feet. It‚Äôs hard to get injured when you‚Äôre just going for a cruise. When you‚Äôre good with that, start trying some of your favorite tricks again. Low risk low effort ones like shoves is a great place to start"
Funnily enough I somehow managed to hurt myself last time on a cruise
"That's a tough one, confidence is such a hard thing to grasp. I injured myself quote a few times too, once I twisted my ankle badly after basically landing from a high jump with my board on top of my foot, nearly tearing my ankles. I was back on the next day, despite the pain. Getting back on quickly is often key, as you simply don't have time to mull over what happened. Unfortunately that ship has sailed for you. Not sure what to suggest other than ""try to push through"". You're the boss of your body, if you tell it to go, it'll go, mind over matter. Take it slow, just step on and maybe let it roll down a gentle decline, getting the feeling back in your body. It'll pass, bro!"

"On May 27th, 2019, I was riding my electric skateboard in BC when I was struck from behind by a car. I was riding on the side of the road, straddling the shoulder line. I heard the car approaching from behind and expected her to go around, but she struck me with the right front corner of her car, knocking me off my board onto the road. Thankfully, I rolled to the right and did not go underneath the vehicle. However, I did receive a sprained ankle, bruised hip and various cuts and bruises. I was unable to work as I was on crutches and was therefore off work for 3 weeks. My board was also almost completely destroyed. There was no damage to her vehicle. I would like to pursue retribution in the form of lost wages and compensation for my property. My question is this: How should I go about this, as e-boards are illegal in BC but it is likely she was distracted driving?"
Talk to a personal injury lawyer.
Open a claim with her insurance
"Thanks people, I've done both those things, I was just wondering if anyone had any information regarding the legality issued."
I‚Äôm the mom whose 16 yr old had the skateboarding accident - I have some good news to share!
"First of all...my thanks once again for all the love and support I received here. It helped so much to know so many people were thinking of us. She has improved and is doing really well. She is still having headaches but they‚Äôre much less intense. She gets overwhelmed from sensory input more easily but this is normal, plus she has always been easily overstimulated. As a baby, I knew I had 20 minutes in any store before we had to be out of there lol."
"On to THE GOOD NEWS! I only mentioned this in a reply to a comment during the accident posts, because it wasn‚Äôt about me, but I was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2019. I underwent chemo, 3 surgeries, radiation, and more chemo which finally ended in November 2020. I‚Äôm considered in remission now."
"There‚Äôs an organization called Little Pink Houses of Hope that provides week-long beach vacations for breast cancer patients, their families, and their caregivers. I WAS CHOSEN FOR ONE OF THESE VACATIONS!! We will receive a full week‚Äôs lodging, a $300 gift card for food/activities, and a professional family photo shoot. Normally they schedule activities all through the week, but due to Covid they‚Äôre doing the gift card instead."
"I‚Äôm responsible for transportation, but thanks to the 2nd job I had taken on a couple of months ago, I have the money for plane tickets and a rental car, and some spending money as well!"
"I‚Äôll spare you the details, but we have had a lot of bad shit happening for the last two years in our lives. Even right now we just found out our cat is dying. It‚Äôs just always something. But this vacation is going to be amazing. My sister was my main caregiver, and her boss is letting her take the week off, so she will be coming with us! I am SO EXCITED!"
"The trip is going to be the last week in April, and we‚Äôll be staying in Carolina Beach, NC. The date and place are chosen for us by the organization. I‚Äôve never been to that beach, or done anything besides drive through a tiny part of NC on a road trip once, so I‚Äôm excited to get to see a new place! I don‚Äôt know what our lodging will look like yet but it will be a private unit with kitchen etc. My son is so dang sweet - he told me he‚Äôs willing to sleep on the couch if he has to so Allie can have a room to herself."
"I‚Äôm a little nervous about flying because of Covid, but my sister and I will be fully vaccinated by then, and the kids have had Covid so hopefully they still have antibodies. I got some N95 masks from work for the plane ride. We‚Äôll take all precautions to stay safe."
"As you can tell I‚ÄôM SO EXCITED! Lol. If you know anything about Carolina Beach or Wilmington, give me pointers!"

If you guys like burritos you HAVE TO drive up to Wilmington (like 15-20 min) and go to Flaming Amy's Burrito Barn! They are my FAVORITE place to eat EVER. When we make the trip back there every couple years I eat at Flaming Amy's literally every day of vacation.
I don't have any current information on the area, haven't been back since 2019, our 2020 trip was cancelled. But if you have any questions about the general area, please feel free to DM me, I lived there for 20 years."
I love aquariums! That will be really fun. I‚Äôll put the burrito place on my list! Thanks!
Yay. Congratulations. I'm happy for you.
üôèüèæ‚ú® omg this is so sad!! I just read that she had a successful surgery. Prayers to Michelle‚Äô family
Fuck I'm so sorry and sad for her. What a nightmare. I hope Brielle can pull through.
""
"This is unbelievably heartbreaking. So, so sad for Michelle and her family."
Praying right now!
O dear God come to her aid and bring healing and comfort.
This is horrifying! I can't imagine how she myst be feeling right now.
This is absolutely awful. I hope she‚Äôs gonna get better.
"Prayers for Brielle! This is awful. Sometimes things look very bleak but miracles do happen. When my sister ended up in a coma 10+ years ago we nearly lost her twice. She needed to be resuscitated twice, things did not look good, the doctor told us she would die. A priest went into her room twice to give her the final blessings. She was gone basically. It was horrible. Then she woke up and got all better. All the worst case scenarios we were warned about didn‚Äôt come true. She got better just like that. We were bracing ourselves for the worst and she pulled through with no lasting consequences.
Never lose faith. Life works in mysterious ways. I do believe there‚Äôs something out there keeping an eye on us based on things my sister told me she saw while she was in her coma. She went somewhere and came back because she knew she had to come back."
what happened to your sister that put her in a coma? it‚Äôs amazing she recovered but it seems like michelle‚Äôs daughter has a severe brain/head injury which typically doesn‚Äôt bode well.
God I hope she pulls through this! I‚Äôll keep the family in my prayers üôèüôè
"Oh man, this is so sad. I will keep her daughter in my thoughts."
I‚Äôm literally devastated beyond words. Been following her since BW‚Äôs season and this is just so so sad.
"Oh my goodness, what an absolute nightmare. Sending many positive thoughts and prayers to Michelle, her daughter and her family. üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏èüôè"
How horrible. A parent's worst nightmare.
Oh my god. What a nightmare.
"Oh, my God. As a mom, this made me feel sick. Poor Michelle. Hope she makes a full recovery."
I feel sick for Michelle and her family. Prayers sent above.
"Holy fuck this is just heartbreaking :(
Always wear a helmet people. ALWAYS. I had a number of close calls like this when I was younger which led to a doctor asking me ""Tony Hawk wears a helmet, are you smarter than Tony Hawk?"".
No I am not.
Helmets save lives. It doesn't matter if they mess up your hair or make you look ""un-cool"" because it sure as hell is better than winding up brain dead or sedated in a coma teetering on the edge of death. Always wear a helmet and always remind others what can happen if they don't wear a helmet. Buy a helmet that properly fits your head snug and secure and be sure to wear it the right way.
Sending all my hopes and prayers to Brielle and Michelle right now. The brain is an adaptable thing that can heal from injuries like this and Gary Busey is living proof of that. I hope that Brielle will be okay and I hope more people see this post and WEAR A FUCKING HELMET!"
"so annoyed that Ontario as a province doesn't have a law about wearing helmets :(, I see people riding in downtown Toronto w/o a helmet alllll the time. I also see giant trucks not shoulder checking allll the time..."
"THIS. in early february, i wiped out on my electric scooter (still not sure how, i think the throttle got stuck and i swerved to not run into someone who walked into the middle of the street in front of me) and i was SO LUCKY i was wearing a helmet, even though i was only going 2 blocks. i almost didn't wear it. even with the helmet, i had a decent sized goose egg on my forehead, which did bleed a little, and my glasses were smashed upon impact, but it's nothing in comparison to how bad it could've been without the helmet.

yes, please always wear a helmet people, even if you're just going down the street."
"Yes, wear a helmet!!!!!! When my dad was a teen his step-brother died from this exact situation. Thoughts for Brielle and Michelle, I hope she pulls through üíîüíò"

I sprained my wrist in a skateboard accident. My wrist still hurts 7 weeks later because I have to work in the back of kitchen
Landed on my left wrist to brace my fall. Now it hurts when I turn it. I‚Äôm thinking it will never heal because I work in a kitchen at a restaurant. Should I take a month off or continue to work
"My wrist hurts 3 1/2 years after a ‚Äúsprain.‚Äù I tried bracing it, but the pain persisted if I apply and pressure with a bent wrist.

"‚ÄúSit down, and call me Mike.‚Äù
I obliged, sitting on the only actual chair in the room. The figure sitting across from me was covered head to toe, wearing a long sleeve flannel shirt and gloves, and a strange plastic mask that covered his entire face. A towel was also wrapped around his head and neck, and he lounged comfortably in a bean bag chair. I discreetly tried to see if there was any exposed skin, but I saw none.
‚ÄúUh, yes, Mr.- I mean Mike. So anyways, as I said I‚Äôm a reporter from Vice News and I was hoping that we could discuss your company and your role in its astonishing rise.‚Äù
Mike laughed. ‚ÄúOf course, of course, we can talk about that if you really want to. But be straight with me- you‚Äôre really here to see if you can do what everyone else has failed to do and learn something, anything about me for sure. I‚Äôve seen the Buzzfeed articles, some of you journalists have quite the imagination. Elon Musk‚Äôs secret twin brother? Really?‚Äù
I smiled, a bit nervously. ‚ÄúWell of course if you have anything to say about yourself I‚Äôd be thrilled. But considering how closely you‚Äôve guarded your privacy so far, I doubt it. So I‚Äôm happy to interview you about your business, then try and analyze every word you said for tiny clues so that my less serious colleagues can write clickbait articles about you.‚Äù
Mike laughed again. His frequent laughter was throwing me off- I had assumed that he would be a serious man, based on his privacy and how closely he must have managed his business to achieve the gains he had seen in the past few years.
‚ÄúWell I appreciate the honesty. And- sorry, what was your name?‚Äù
‚ÄúJake‚Äù
‚ÄúAlright Jake, I like your style so I‚Äôll answer some questions for you. What do you want to know?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, what do you attribute your success to?‚Äù
‚ÄúPure dumb luck.‚Äù
I blinked in surprise. ‚ÄúLuck?‚Äù
‚ÄúCompletely. I started my company to start making various apps to improve people‚Äôs lives. I‚Äôm fascinated by technology, you know, especially how big a part of everything the internet has become. I mean, imagine if you took this technology back even a few decades in time, and tried to explain an iPhone to some kid from the 90s. Not just how it was real and not science fiction, but also how you use it in your day to day life. It‚Äôs amazing! I think a lot of people take these things for granted. But anyways, I‚Äôm off topic. I started my company and immediately, some guy that I‚Äôd never heard of asked to come and work for me, and it turned out he was one of the brightest software developers of our time, and left his six figure job just to work for pennies under me. And when word got out, more followed. Especially after one of my competitors unexpectedly shut down, almost their entire staff came to work here. In a year I went from self employed to owning a company of over 550 employees. And I stayed lucky, Apple decided to start featuring dozens of our apps in their app store, and Google did the same in the play store. On some of them, like DriveSafe, we averaged 5 million downloads a day in the first months after release.‚Äù Mike leaned forward in his bean bag chair. ‚ÄúPure dumb luck, all of it. But anyways, enough business. What kind of music do you like?‚Äù
‚ÄúUh- anything I suppose.‚Äù I was taken aback by the abrupt change of topic.
‚ÄúBullshit. You like mainstream stuff, but I guarantee that I could put on half a dozen songs that you‚Äôd hate with a passion- have you ever listened to ‚ÄòEndless, Nameless‚Äô?‚Äù
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say I know it‚Äù
‚ÄúExactly, because unless you love grunge, it sounds like trash. Here, I‚Äôll play it for you-‚Äú
Mike said this as he stood, but stumbled over the bean bag chair he had been sitting in and tripped to the ground. As he turned, I froze in surprise and I couldn‚Äôt help but stare.
Mike‚Äôs plastic mask and towel had fallen off as he tripped. And looking back at me was not the face of a man with a severe skin disease (as was the popular theory for his refusal to show his face) but the empty eye sockets of a skull.
‚ÄúWHAT THE FU-‚Äú
‚ÄúShut up, shut the fuck up, calm down!‚Äù Hearing normal speech come from the up and down movement of an exposed jawbone did not calm me down, and I began to hyperventilate. I tried to stand, but my legs were shaking and I fell back into my seat. ‚ÄúGod damnit, god fucking damnit. Alright, fuck, calm down, and I‚Äôll explain. I guess I have to. I‚Äôd really prefer you didn‚Äôt publish this, not that anyone would believe you, but I really don‚Äôt want people looking into my past more than they already do.‚Äù
I was still frozen in my seat.
‚ÄúWell basically I‚Äôm what you‚Äôd call a Lich, or at least that‚Äôs the dungeons and dragons word for it, and I haven‚Äôt heard a better one. I was born in 1974, and when I was a teenager I got into the occult. I was fucking around, it was all a joke really, but one day I found a spell for immortality. My friends and I all did it, nothing happened, we laughed about it and joked we couldn‚Äôt be killed. But the next day I was rereading it and something caught my eye. Whoever had written the thing had written something into the decorative margins. I realized it looked familiar because they wrote it in the elvish that Tolkien uses in Lord of the Rings. Yeah, I‚Äôm a fucking nerd, I know, and it was Sindarin, before you ask, not that you probably know what that is. But the last guy to have the book was just as much of a nerd and left a message for the next nerd who found it. And it was a few modifications to the ingredients and the spell. I did it, out of curiosity- and the symbols I drew on my basement floor glowed, then faded and then nothing. I didn‚Äôt think anything had changed, and decided the glowing must have been my imagination. About four or five years later, I was skateboarding, tried a stunt I wasn‚Äôt good enough for, and broke my neck, dead on impact. Then suddenly I wake up in the dark. I realize I‚Äôm in a box, manage to break it open and claw my way through a few feet of dirt to the surface. Then I saw what I looked like. I was a fucking skeleton. I hid, and realized that it wasn‚Äôt 1996 anymore, it was 2014. I had been dead for 18 years. But I still had no idea what was going on and why I was now a living skeleton. But I did feel a tugging. I followed it, moving only at night, until I found myself at a landfill, and then to one specific trash bag. In it was a lot of my parents old stuff, including that VHS tape.‚Äú he pointed to one on a shelf. ‚ÄúIt was a recording of Saved by the Bell, but when I held it I felt complete. So I took it. Also, though I didn‚Äôt give it any mind at the time, there was a dead, half crushed rat.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat does the rat have to do with anything?‚Äù
‚ÄúJust listen, okay? So I made myself a disguise of sorts, with clothing, a ski mask, gloves and some shades that I found at the landfill. I went back to the old public library, broke in at night, and found that occult book still exactly where it had been back in my day. I read the next page, after the spell, and found more elvish that I should have seen and translated. Apparently the immortality was by binding my soul to a vessel- and since I hadn‚Äôt used one, it had latched onto something random nearby, the tape of Saved by the Bell. I also hadn‚Äôt completed the ritual. I needed to kill an animal and spill its blood on the vessel to make it complete. When that dead rat touched the tape, it completed the ritual and my body reawakened in the graveyard. Near as I can figure, my hoarder of a mother hadn‚Äôt wanted to throw away her precious VHS collection until recently, and my dad probably threw a dead rat from a trap in the trash bag before taking it out.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs quite a story‚Äù
‚ÄúI may as well tell you the rest of it. I was lying during the interview, it wasn‚Äôt luck that built my company. As a Lich apparently I possess a number of magical abilities, especially with the aid of my book. There is a lot of hidden writing in the margins, written mostly in Elvish and Klingon, that makes the spells work. That‚Äôs how I built this company. Magic. Lots of magic. All so that I can lounge around, listen to Nirvana, and wish that I still had lungs to smoke some pot with.‚Äù
Mike sat back down in his bean bag chair. ‚ÄúSo, any questions?‚Äù"
"Haha, this was great. I love the last bit about wanting lungs to smoke pot with."
"A restaurant by me has new owners and they are redecorating, they agreed to not cover this old stencil found under a table of a local kid who died in a skateboarding accident."
They should scan it and try and have tile made with the stencil included. That way can redecorate AND keep the memorial.
How about sealing it under a double width clear glass tile?
That‚Äôs awesome! Where is that?
Socal
Near OP.
Why are they putting tile under tables?
"I think that's the wall (i.e. below the table), and the table sits atop the tile line."
Because it looks nice
Died and brought back to life in hospital from skateboard accident
".......and i don't remember having any kind of existential visions or having any kind of consciousness at any point. i don't know what the people here are talking about. no ""lights"", no life flashbacks, none of that. hell, i don't even remember the accident itself, all i know from the accident is what people tell me."
"Not everyone experiences it. Some people, maybe you included, might not remember it. If you look at NDERF studies I believe the number is something like 30% of ROSC patients that experience NDE. Just because you don‚Äôt experience it doesn‚Äôt discredit the 1000s of others who have."
"christians and the united states president do it everyday, why can't i?"
That must have been one mad skateboard accident . Did your heart stop ? Were you in a drug induced coma to help the swelling of your brain go down ? What happened ?
"yes and yes. i was alone when i bailed, the person who found me was my neighbor coming home from work, he saw me unconscious in the middle of the street with a river of blood going from my head to the gutters. i didn't return to complete consciousness for up to three days, and in that time period, i didn't even know my parent's and grandparent's names."
Your soul and spirit were still in your body in other words God wanted you to have the accident but not to see him and heaven. Its all fine happens to many.
"You should meditate, it might help you remember"
"Not everyone remembers, much like dreams."
Tap and Gap. She wouldn't remember to be angry or feel cheap.

Were any of the Beach Boys ever involved in a skateboard accident?
"Ok, I know this sounds weird, but when I was quite young I watched a tv movie about the Beach Boys. At some point in the film there was a scene were one of them was being dragged behind a car on a skate board and was hit by an oncoming car. This member (too long ago to remember which one, but I always assumed it was Brian) was left a bit brain damaged, but years later recovered enough to fight be able to play a concert again."
"Now this doesn't sound like anything that I can see actually happened, so either I've remembered the movie being about the wrong band, or they just invented it as a way to not tall about Brian's mental health issues."
"Does anyone know about this movie or the actual events, if any?"
Had to be Jan Berry. Jan and Dean even had a song about skateboarding called called Sidewalk Surfing
"Thanks, probably young me thought I was watching a movie about the Beach Boys!"
"You might be thinking about Jan & Dean and Jan Berry's comeback after a car accident. They had a song called Sidewalk Surfin' and there was a movie about them named after their biggest hit song, Deadman's Curve. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_and_Dean#1966.E2.80.9368:_Berry.27s_car_wreck"
"It's possible, and I just thought it was the beach boys. This would have been in the eighties at the least."
What about this is unexpected? That did look like a rough accident.
I was expecting him to make a miraculous recovery

I got into a bit of a skateboarding accident going too fast. I scraped my back and my arm. I haven‚Äôt felt this alive in almost a year.
"Title. I was going down a huge slope really really fast when I lost control and fell. I rolled forward on the harsh concrete scraping my back, arm and piercing the skin on my hand."
"Sure it stung a bit where the scrapes were but while everyone was worried for my well-being while cleaned my wounds, I secretly felt a ton of joy, happiness, and serenity (even if it was fleeting)."
"Since covid and lockdown, I‚Äôve been living with my parents preparing to leave home after college. I‚Äôve felt so so dead inside. Like I was just wasting away at home, waiting to die. It hurt so fucking much going through the motions laying in bed and doing relatively nothing all day."
"When is going down that slope, I remembered what it feels like to have some adrenaline soar through my body, feel air race across my scalp, the razor thin edge between joy and fear blurring as I move faster and faster down the slope. It was so refreshing. Even when I feel and was hurt, I felt more relief than pain, and it calmed me."
"glad you're okay! i totally get what you mean. life has been at a standstill for a lot of people over the last year or so, and the monotony has been frustrating to say the least. just don't go all Evel Knievel and become an adrenaline junkie! lol"
"Lol no, I wont become an adrenaline junkie. Typically I get my adrenaline from playing sports and that‚Äôs just enough for me, but because of Covid, I haven‚Äôt gotten the chance to play pickup (or for a team)."
"Omg I just got an ebike and I hope so much for that feeling of excitement and thrill. I just hope not to fall in front of a truck, ya know??"
"Oh yeah, please stay safe, wear your helmet and follow safety guidelines!!"
"had a similar experience once, people just don't get it
the feeling you get and even the pain is a relief from every day stress and routine!"
Right!!! I tried explaining it to my friends and family and they looked at me like I was crazy lol

Hey friends. My girlfriend was involved in a horrific skateboarding accident Thursday. She is recovering but the medics were forced to cut up our favorite Oh Sees t-shirt that we got at their show at Warsaw in Brooklyn. If anyone has this shirt in a medium or large we'd be happy to purchase!
unfortunately mine is a small and i'm not willing to part with it....but i bet this would still look super rad if you fixed it up somehow!! think r/Visiblemending
Might be possible to stitch the shirt onto a jacket (or whatever else) like a patch?! r/battlejackets is pretty keen on this. Wishing her a speedy recovery.
That's terrible! Sent you a message.
"I hope she's ok. I was at those Warsaw shows and have that shirt, but not in those sizes. Good luck!"
Love and support goes out to you both.
"Means so much to hear that. Thank you, my friend."
V happy to hear she's recovering. I have a small that I would love to send you so that you can cannibalize it into something more badass.
"So sorry, if I had this t-shirt I‚Äôd definitely give it to her! Wishing you both the best!"
So sorry to hear! I hope she‚Äôs doing okay! I live in philly and I THINK I have that shirt in a S and M. If I can dig up the M it‚Äôs hers!! I‚Äôll be in touch! Gotta search for it. Ps. Oh sees are my fav ever so me and your lady are pretty cool people üòé
Thank you! This would be awesome
"I saw the post where you were thanking someone for sending the new shirt, glad to see she seems to be doing better. I hope she gets back on the board and continues to shred."
Oh no! Hope she‚Äôs okay!
