Will Medical Insurance Cover Expenses from a Skateboard Accident?
"I have a normal, probably most usual insurance plan, joint with my parents. I am a college student. My friend proposed me to try skateboarding, and I fell on the ground within the first 10 minutes. I have a concussion. I am in the emergency room, they held me in the ER for 6 hours and I still haven't gotten back my CAT scan."
"My mother is freaking out now that our insurance doesn't cover extreme sport activities, which skateboarding sort of is, so we'll go bankrupt for the CAT scan and waiting time in the ER. Idk if she is right. How likely is it that this will be used as pretext to deny coverage? I am using one of the biggest health providers in America, if it matters."
Thanks a lot to anyone who responds.
Yes! This is covered under medical insurance.
"I mean, no shit, but you can get a concussion with a helmet. It depends on how fast OP was going."
"It‚Äôs hard to say 100% without saying your specific policy but skateboarding isn‚Äôt usually excluded as an extreme sport. It‚Äôs not like you were jumping the Grand Canyon.
Also, you won‚Äôt be billed by waiting time, but by the complexity of your injury, the type of examination they perform and what kind of medical history they take (asking you about your injury). Since you‚Äôve been waiting 6 hours, it‚Äôs not a true ‚Äúemergency‚Äù like a gunshot wound and won‚Äôt be billed at the higher level of visit."
Yes you‚Äôre fine. Do not delay any medical care.
"I am the only person in the family with decent English. I will be able to call them once I'm out of ER, but I really wish to calm her down for the remaining time. And the premise that falling from a skateboard is any different than an electric scooter or slipping and falling seems absurd to me."
I‚Äôm confused. Do you have reason to believe that your bills won‚Äôt be covered? The incident that caused your visit has no bearing on billing codes.
"Well, iirc, skydiving injuries, or scuba diving injuries, can be disallowed, depending on whether or not they're explicitly disallowed as ""high risk sports.""
But something like skateboarding? Nah."
"The cause for the injury doesn‚Äôt matter. If you are injured and treatment is considered medically necessary, it will be covered by insurance."
"Your injury will most likely be covered, most fully insured medical plans are required by law to cover common accidental injuries like this. And as for any exclusions for extreme sports, that only applies if you are a professional skateboarder/race car driver/some other extreme sport‚Ä¶ not for some kid trying to skateboard for the first time. You will be fine, but you will have a copay or some level of coinsurance, which can get expensive. You may also be responsible for a deductible, but there is an out of pocket maximum on all plans, so your liability is limited. The specifics will depend on your plan, so if you really want to know how much you will be on the hook for, you will need an EOB from the hospital, which they will typically send to you in the mail or provide upon discharge. Source: I‚Äôm an insurance broker."
"You and your mother are jumping the gun. When you get the EOB (Explanation of benefits) from your insurance company you will see how much they pay the hospital and how much you are being asked to pay. That is the only document that matters right now, the EOB.
It doesn't matter what the hospital is billing, it matters what insurance is paying and what the insurance says you owe.
And you won't know that for some time."
"Seeing the doctor soon. Skateboard accident, toes are swollen. I‚Äôm scared for the results."
We will find out if your a weakling
"Surely a true strongbone would not be scared for the results.
Stay strong of bone, brother."
"Swollen toes normally means a sprain if memory serves, however, i may be wrong. Either way don't fear for the potential of weak bones. Strong bones must be reinforced further with an iron will."
"yeah, I damaged my tendons/ligaments. Pretty painful, but they're healing quickly"
"If your bones truly belong here, you'd know that you needn't be scared brother.
God speed on your healing if your bones are in tact."
I'm no doctor but I reckon wind resistance from the hairy legs was probably the real culprit here.
"It was a new electric skateboard I bought, so my fleecy legs stood no chance"
Whats the update? Broke or not broken?
not broken! Just a pulled tendon

YA Book Young Boy in Coma After Bike or Skateboard Accident
"I read this book in middle school, I can‚Äôt remember the name or the author and google is zero help. It‚Äôs about a boy who breaks his neck in either a bmx bike or skateboard accident and is in a coma in the hospital. The majority of the time it seems like he‚Äôs not in a coma, he remembers the nurses coming to take care of him and he spends a lot of time with a girl who is in there because she has an ed. I remember it specifically mentioning she has a feeding tube and is upset about getting better. He wakes up from the coma and it turns out he never met the girl of course but the nurses talked about her while caring for him or something. He freaks out when he wakes up on a ventilator btw. At the end of the book he goes to a restaurant of some sort and sees a girl that looks just like the girl he saw in his coma and he‚Äôs confused because he never actually met her. That‚Äôs all I remember someone please help me find this book. TIA"
"Omfg, I looked this book up, I clearly miss remembered some details but that‚Äôs it! Thank you so so much. I‚Äôve been trying to find this book for years"

Any tips on how to overcome fear of hurting myself after skateboard injury?
"So, I sprained my ankle really badly practising nose stall on a small ledge a while ago. After months of physiotherapy to heal/straighten my ankle I feel like I'm physically ready to skateboard again."
"But I don't think I'm mentally ready to try things yet. I can push around and go up and down ramps and do some kickturns, but anything apart from that (Ollies, rock to fakie, nose stall, shuvit/pop shuvit) I simply can't do it due to a mental block."
Anyone's got any tips on overcoming the mental block of getting hurt again?
I broke my arm on a hill bomb last year and the fear was definitely real after enough time off. I'm still regaining the comfort I had but for me what really helped is thinking about being on my death bed and regretting not pushing on
"that's a good one, thank you"
"I too have been injured so many times that there is this constant fear and worry. I mitigate that by wearing knee pads and padded gloves and elbow pads, and I'm going to order the hillbilly shorts."
I've been thinking about wearing pads as well. I need to find a comfortable one as the ones I've tried before were really uncomfortable! Thanks
think about you landing the trick ‚Ä¶
"i‚Äôm in a similar situation, i was going down a hill and the board tripped on a rock and i fell straight onto my back, and got a bruised lung and ribs"
I broke my ankle skating and I‚Äôm barely a beginner I‚Äôve been skating about 2 months now I don‚Äôt know how to get back into it at all. Did you ever skate again?
"Yeah I have, but just pushing around or doing kickturns into mini ramps, etc. I've tried to Ollie by my brain won't allow me to jump so I can't do it.
Well, I'm just trying to have fun and get comfortable with pushing. Maybe in a couple of months I'll feel like trying other things!"
Recovering from a skateboard injury I bought this complete wtp second hand. Here‚Äôs to trying something new at 30.
It‚Äôs a blast. I have skated for over 15 years but I bought a WTP Cyris 2020 thing is so fun to play on. And I‚Äôll be 36 in November gotta stay young LOL
"Right on man. Yeah I‚Äôve been having so much fun on this thing, my first bmx owned bike, I‚Äôm happy with wtp!"
"Nice! Funny thing, Most bmxers in my city (Honolulu) are failed skateboarders lol. üëçüèª"
Haha that‚Äôs funny yeah I haven‚Äôt been on a skateboard since. Been cruising around with the bike in the riverbed below the pictured bridge. My injury slows my progression but getting on this bike is way fucking fun!
"(Skateboard injury, regular foot stance) Pop shuv-it over a large crack in parking lot pavement bail"
"Broke my ankle (specifically my fibula) from a freak skateboarding accident at the beginning of May. My scar area is smooth and clean but the swelling around my ankle is still very apparent. According to my doctor, the bones look all healed but the ligaments aren't quite there yet, which is why I won't be able to walk on it until July 31st which is my next appointment. Could this slower healing of ligaments explain why I still have some swelling around my ankle? And I also can't bend it as far back as my good foot, hoping that is normal. I'm not forcing it or anything, it's just part of the excercises he told me I should do every day whenever I temporarily take off the medical boot ----UPDATE---- I've been able to bear full weight as of 2 weeks ago which was a struggle at first but is much easier now with physical therapy! I'm feeling a lot better but it's not where it needs to be yet, I can't jog or run yet. I ordered an ankle brace to speed up the process and also protect my ankle further. Was this a decent idea?"
Swelling is gonna happen with it for the foreseeable future. I invested in compression socks for when I‚Äôm walking around and that helps a lot. Do you‚Äôre exercises and PT religiously and you should heal up fine.
Good to know; thanks so much. Definitely gonna look at some compression socks on Amazon. Are ankle braces potentially helpful too?

Skateboard Injury - Need Second Oppinion
"On monday I injured my right leg skateboarding. Ive been to the hospital and they wrote it off as a sprained knee without conducting an MRI. When I fell my right knee hyperextended and I heard a pop. My ankle might have rolled but I dont remember as i was focused on the pop of my knee. Its been a week since then and my right foot is swollen and no matter the remedy the swelling will not go down. (Ice, naproxen, raised). I have pain that radiates from the right side below the knee and down the calf. Almost like if im constantly stretching it. Ever since I was a child if I cupped my knees they would both have a soft popping feel and soft clicks. The injured knee no longer does this."

Got in a skateboard crash and damaged my xps 15 bottom chassis. How fixable is this?
Looks like you can straighten it back. Get a block of wood and try pressing that part that sticks up to flatten it.
"If no insurance and it performs, let it go, the torn up look is cool anyway according to my fashion conscious daughter."
"Bend it back with a pair of needle nose pliers and a small hammer, and then resurface the side with some fine sandpaper. I'll looks like new."
What makes you assume op has one?
Best option would be to remove the bottom plate and try and straighten it out to prevent damage to the PC. Personally I would just replace the plate.
"If it works, don't make it worse."
"If that‚Äôs just the spot for a laptop lock to connect and everything is else is working, ignore it"
"I'd be more worried about the hinge that connects your screen to the chassis, they are usually one of the most fragile things to break and it's a difficult to fix without replacing."
"Thanks for all your replies! I‚Äôve contacted Dell and they quoted just $39 (no warranty) to replace the bottom chassis but it‚Äôll take 12-15biz days. I‚Äôve also asked if they could send me the bottom chassis so I can replace it myself.
A lot of you have convinced me that I should stop crying abt it haha. if it‚Äôs just superficial and that may be what I should do. Regardless, the repair isn‚Äôt bad so the option is there Incase this happens to anyone else.
Edit: They do ship parts, it was $9 for the bottom chassis and $9 for shipping n handling lol"
"have done this, but need to be comfortable with somewhat disassembling if needed... i had to pull my motherboard, and use tools to flatten out the bend, then re-assemble (so as not to damage the components while doing ""body work"")"
"I do a fair bit of tinkering and repair as an engineering student, so I might look into this. Thanks!"
"As other said, you can try and straighten it. If you don't need the security slot, then it's a minor issue. Biggest concern I would have is any friction on the display/hinge mechanism - by the photo, it almost looks like the chassis is twisted up a bit in the back.
If that's not causing any issues, do your best to bend it back but I wouldn't risk doing much more to it. If that's the worst damage after a skateboard crash, count yourself lucky!"
"The display seems just fine, the hinge seems to be unharmed. I did measure the gaps with some good calipers and they did get bent up by 0.2mm compared to the other side.
I was on an electric skateboard as well doing ~15mph so yeah I got lucky. Minor bruises but that‚Äôs about it, always wear a helmet!"
It‚Äôs the new 2022 9520 btw :(
What port is that which is damaged?
"That part is plastic and will likely crack if you take the advice about ‚Äúbending‚Äù or ‚Äúsanding‚Äù. If you have accidental damage coverage Dell will send a tech to fix it. If you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs pretty easy to replace the bottom cover BUT this is entirely cosmetic as the hole that is warped is for a lock you almost certainly will never use."
"XPS chassis is metal. If it bent one way, it'll likely bend back."
You can probably order a replacement bottom case cover or try to bend it back in place since it's aluminum but it won't look pretty
if you bought the accidental damage warranty then it will cover it. if not then you can order a replacement bottom chassis through support and replace it yourself very easily if thats the only thing that needs replacement.
From looks of guides and the pictures the entire bottom panel is a single piece so a few screws and 15 min you should be able to swap it easy. Since it is just cosmetic I wouldn't be to concerned unless you use a lock a good bit on it. You could try pulling the case and bending it back then if it doesn't look/sit right order the bottom shell. Just be sure to look at the screen hinges to verify they are still firmly in place to top half of shell

Given the impact injury and location a hernia seems very unlikely. More like an abdominal wall contusion. It's very reassuring you aren't having much pain but you should be checked. It sounds like you're off to the ER. Hope all is well.
"Only recently learned this, but does the location suggest a possible spigelian hernia? Found this trauma-induced case (though that patient is an older female, a more typical demographic) for some comparison*

"Electric skateboard crash, death in Vail"
"""He had just received the electric skateboard the day before the incident, according to the report.""
Here's a timely reminder to take it easy on a new board no matter how experienced you may or may not be, sounds like he was an experience skater and snowboarder. RIP"
"Yeah and also know the course you're riding before you open up the throttle on it. I only ride full speed in areas that I'm familiar with the locations of manhole covers and cracks in the road. It's so easy to have the ground drop out from underneath you unexpectedly or to have a hard bump catch you off guard and when you're really moving, those forces amplify faster than you can compensate for."
"So true man. I‚Äôm currently full of exterior pins from a Tib/fib break on the day I bought my new board returning to skating. Have a second surgery later this week when I get the real hardware. Surgeon says 6-9 months till I can walk again, and probably a year and a half till l ‚ÄúCan do it without thinking about it‚Äù, which implies to me it will probably be painful.
I plan to get back on in the future when/if possible. Granted that my leg is stable enough and not too painful."
Sounds like maybe the kingpin snapped if the wheels were hanging off by the wires‚Ä¶ brutal. Guessing he wasn‚Äôt wearing a helmet? My heart goes out to him and his family.
Weird that they don't mention whether a helmet was worn or not. It's usually one of the first things mentioned in all the skier deaths that get reported up there in the mountains.
"Oh, I thought they were describing a broken off rear portion of the deck, and his wheel got stuck in the dip."
I broke both my legs recently! Probably would be dead if I wasn't wearing a helmet! WEAR YOUR HELMETS WHEN YOU RIDE. Invest in torso and leg armor. Get a decent set of gloves. Everyone please be safe and have fun.

"When I first saw this I assumed thar had to have been an Eatser egg to the twins. Unless they filmed it in public I guess and it's just a coincidence. Idk much about how film works, but I assume they wouldn't be allowed to have those people in the background without their consent therefore it mus the intentional but that's just me assuming how the film industry works."
I wonder if that was intentional or not lol
Nothing in the show is unintentional.
"I'm surprised there's no comments about this, but this was completely intentional. They were talking about ""bad choice roads"", the choices they make sending them down a good or bad path. This shot is showing how all this started with Jimmy, with something simple like 2 skateboarders trying to pull a scam; that's why they're at the start of the road he's going down."
"Yep they can't film random people without them signing a disclaimer form to be shown on TV unless their faces are blurred out. Everyone you see on film isn't there by accident, they're all extras or members of the public who have signed waiver forms. Nothing is by accident or pure chance on TV/Film."
I wonder if there would have been any waterworks if they crashed hard enough into the fire hydrant?
I remember when all cars were. My first car I got in 1979. I was 19. It was a 1971 Buick LeSabre. I could haul all m friends around and take them to the Friday night midnight showings of Rocky Horror picture show! Or for any other occasion. Lol
What did Vince mean by that?
"Y'all good?
Of course those are hired extras, but that doesn't mean that was intentional. An extra making a mistake is not uncommon. Maybe they kept it in because they thought no one would notice."

She looked at me and saw I was stopped so she started to go and make a right turn. As she started to turn, I slipped from my board and the board went toward her car without me on it. The timing was perfect and the back tire of her car hit the front lip of my board which popped the board up and broke the rear brake light and caused two scratches/dents above and below the rear brake light. She is a neighbor that lives a few houses down. Since this was my fault, I gave my contact info and told them to send me a quote to have it repaired. This is a 2014 Mercedes E350. A couple days later, they sent me the quote from the dealership and it totaled $3,100. Basically, replacing the panels was quite expensive and the brake light and assembly was also around $500 for materials alone. Luxury car repairs are crazy expensive! Since I was not driving my car, I assume I have to pay this out of pocket, which I can. I would like to know what I need to do when I pay them to ensure this settles it and they don't try to take me to court or anything at a later time. I don't think they would as the husband was pretty understanding, but just want to cover my ass just in case. Should I just write a check to them and put the invoice number or some description in the notes field? It's a bummer I have to pay this out of pocket, but I can afford it right now and no one was hurt, so I guess it could have been worse. Your advice is appreciated!"
"Since I was not driving my car, I assume I have to pay this out of pocket
Check with your homeowners/renters insurance if you'd like to go that route. Liability coverage under those policies is often extended to non-motorized, non-marine means of transport (bicycles, scooters, whatever)."
"Since I was not driving my car, I assume I have to pay this out of pocket
I'd think you may be covered by homeowner's or renter's insurance, if you have it."
But be prepared to pay higher rates for at least three years which could possibly wind up more than paying out of pocket.
"Write up a letter saying this settles the debt, reference the estimate amount, and make them sign it before you give them the check. And do this all in person (not by mail)."
"Thanks for the feedback everyone! I will check with my homeowners insurance, but may just have to suck it up and pay out of pocket to avoid higher rates. Also, it was a motorized long board which I built, so that may change things too."
"That theoretically could cause a lot of problems. Potentially home insurance could reject the claim since you were ""driving."" Unlicensed vehicle, no insurance, failure to stop, careless driving, and many more are a variety of generic charges that could be against you. Most places consider motorized boards/bike as unlicensed vehicles.
Are you using a squeeze throttle, or a controlled speed transmission?"
"Check with your car insurance or your renter's insurance, it's not a given that you won't be covered."
Skateboarder crashes hits a hydrant in the backgound
"Noticed this in the background while re watching ""bad choice road"""
"Never noticed, even on rewatch. Thanks!"
You are eligible for compensation . Better call Saul.
"Did you know you have rights? The constitution says you do, and so do I!"
"When I first saw this I assumed thar had to have been an Eatser egg to the twins. Unless they filmed it in public I guess and it's just a coincidence. Idk much about how film works, but I assume they wouldn't be allowed to have those people in the background without their consent therefore it mus the intentional but that's just me assuming how the film industry works."
I wonder if that was intentional or not lol
Nothing in the show is unintentional.
"I'm surprised there's no comments about this, but this was completely intentional. They were talking about ""bad choice roads"", the choices they make sending them down a good or bad path. This shot is showing how all this started with Jimmy, with something simple like 2 skateboarders trying to pull a scam; that's why they're at the start of the road he's going down."
"Yep they can't film random people without them signing a disclaimer form to be shown on TV unless their faces are blurred out. Everyone you see on film isn't there by accident, they're all extras or members of the public who have signed waiver forms. Nothing is by accident or pure chance on TV/Film."
I wonder if there would have been any waterworks if they crashed hard enough into the fire hydrant?
I remember when all cars were. My first car I got in 1979. I was 19. It was a 1971 Buick LeSabre. I could haul all m friends around and take them to the Friday night midnight showings of Rocky Horror picture show! Or for any other occasion. Lol
What did Vince mean by that?
"Y'all good?
Of course those are hired extras, but that doesn't mean that was intentional. An extra making a mistake is not uncommon. Maybe they kept it in because they thought no one would notice."
"Electric skateboard crash, death in Vail"
"""He had just received the electric skateboard the day before the incident, according to the report.""
Here's a timely reminder to take it easy on a new board no matter how experienced you may or may not be, sounds like he was an experience skater and snowboarder. RIP"
"Yeah and also know the course you're riding before you open up the throttle on it. I only ride full speed in areas that I'm familiar with the locations of manhole covers and cracks in the road. It's so easy to have the ground drop out from underneath you unexpectedly or to have a hard bump catch you off guard and when you're really moving, those forces amplify faster than you can compensate for."
"So true man. I‚Äôm currently full of exterior pins from a Tib/fib break on the day I bought my new board returning to skating. Have a second surgery later this week when I get the real hardware. Surgeon says 6-9 months till I can walk again, and probably a year and a half till l ‚ÄúCan do it without thinking about it‚Äù, which implies to me it will probably be painful.
I plan to get back on in the future when/if possible. Granted that my leg is stable enough and not too painful."
Sounds like maybe the kingpin snapped if the wheels were hanging off by the wires‚Ä¶ brutal. Guessing he wasn‚Äôt wearing a helmet? My heart goes out to him and his family.
Weird that they don't mention whether a helmet was worn or not. It's usually one of the first things mentioned in all the skier deaths that get reported up there in the mountains.
"Oh, I thought they were describing a broken off rear portion of the deck, and his wheel got stuck in the dip."
I broke both my legs recently! Probably would be dead if I wasn't wearing a helmet! WEAR YOUR HELMETS WHEN YOU RIDE. Invest in torso and leg armor. Get a decent set of gloves. Everyone please be safe and have fun.
"You broke both your legs riding?!
WTF happened?!"
Why isn't there a type of padding specifically designed for our heads yet?
"Halo board - Beast model. Beast Board is a separate brand, if I‚Äôm not mistaken."
"Broke a rib first month on my Evolve GTR carbon AT, now it‚Äôs all the gear all the time- my full face mtb helmet, wrist elbow and knee guards and a foam back armour - while the AT wheels accelerate and stop a bit fast they roll over almost everything - street wheels scare the fuck out of me every time I put them on and get that extra speed and hit those little stones"
snowboard legend doesnt own a helmet?
"This is sad and sucks but, its part of it.
I live in a state where we can lane split on motorcycles, people say that should be banned because its not safe, nothings ""safe"" just less dangerous."

[AU] - Teen fighting for life after e-skateboard fall
[AU] - Teen fighting for life after e-skateboard fall | Sydney Morning Herald
Does everyone that use their eskate skateboard fall off at one point in time?
One of things that's holding me back is the exposure of falling or hitting something and then flying off on cement. Seen alot of spills online. I guess it's it only a matter of time till you hit something and fall over?
"‚ÄúIts not a matter of if you will fall, its a matter of when.‚Äù However, you can protect yourself. Safety tech has come a long way. Helmets (I suggest full face for your teeth), sliding gloves, elbow and knees. Theres no point in buying an eskate without safety gear the same way you wouldn‚Äôt buy a car without seatbelts and airbags. Budget it out, its necessary, you can get killed.
Practice falling, too! It has seriously made the difference in my health, and often goes overlooked when its just as important. I broke my radius and ulna rollerblading in full gear because I stuck my arm out fully straight instead of bending and letting the elbow pads absorb impact. Would have saved my parents a very pricey hospital bill.
I have been riding for three years. I have thousands of miles on the boards I have used. I go slow. I am careful. I have only fallen twice, and both times could not be planned for. The first time was because someone skated in front of me and cut me off, I bailed in a fortunate way and was completely unharmed. The other time, a front wheel exploded. I would for sure have been seriously maimed if I was not wearing a helmet.
If you want gear recommendations: Helmets - The TSG Pass is by far the most popular, but overpriced and constantly out of stock. I recently bought a new helmet, and did extensive research accordingly. Best options full face were Troy Lee Designs Stage (300), Demon Podium (140), Predator DH-6 (400), Fox Proframe (270).
To protect hands, the idea is to have a sliding surface to bring the energy of the fall to your elbows or horizontally. You need to still hold your remote, though, so wrist sliding devices can get in the way. Flatlands are popular (70) but seek out downhill skateboarding puck gloves that can move the puck around for cheaper options.
I don‚Äôt know as much about elbow pads, but to my knowledge there are two kinds: impact absorbing and sliding. I use impact absorbing Demon Hyper X pads.
Knee pads are similar to elbow pads in the impact or slide variety. I use TSG DHP Downhill pads, but they are pricey and impossible to find anymore. I suggest you buy something that you don‚Äôt need to take your shoes off to put on. Because‚Ä¶
Safety gear that is too cumbersome to wear will not protect you, because you wont wear it. Be safe, but theres a reason eskaters don‚Äôt ride with motorcycle helmets. Other kinds of diminishing returns also exist.
TLDR: You WILL fall. Invest in gear like its part of the board. Practice falling. It‚Äôll be more expensive if you don‚Äôt in hospital bills."
There are videos on yt teaching how to fall and how to practice
"Invest in good protective equipment and I always wear a helmet especially if you have the need for speed. Other than that, buy a skateboard with at wheels. It‚Äôs more expensive but they roll over everything"
"Had a pretty minor fall a month ago and knocked my top front teeth out.....wearing a full face helmet. Shit happens, teeth can be fixed, skin grows back. 2 weeks later back on it again.
If you want safe.... Stay home, watch tv and read about it. Esk8 has its risks, don't be afraid or boring."
How do you knock front teeth out while wear a full face helmet?
"Basically dress for it and expect it. Then it's a bonus if it doesn't happen.
ANY skateboard, motor or not, you are pretty well guaranteed to fall off at some point. There's the nearly invisible pebble (if you have street wheels); locking the wheels on the board if you turn too hard (for some boards); the unexpected and the perennial favourite - user error. With e-boards, though, you're extremely likely to be going faster when you fall off, so protection is a must.
You'll note that that was a ""when"" you fall off, and not an ""if""."
"Yup. Always wear a helmet, and I‚Äôd recommend you actually practice falling a bunch. Literally go full speed at some grass, and dive off. Practice tucking in your appendages and hitting the ground with as much surface area as possible. Tuck your chin into your chest. I‚Äôm actually being serious here. You need to develop a reflex to falling, that way when it happens, your body just knows how to react. Try to save the fall is how people get hurt."
"Not to take away from your suggestion, but top speed on many boards is 35+ mph these days. Maybe fall off at 15 first and step up slowly from there.
If you are a beginner and bought a 35+ mph board, start slowly and spend at least a few weeks riding below 25 before you think about testing the top end. Extensive safety gear over 25 in my opinion as well."
"Finally had my first fall last week. Told myself a quick ride, ended up going 7 miles. #1 rule of avoiding falling, don't do stupid things you know you shouldnt be doing."
"Riding esk8s for 4+ years and I've only fallen a handful of times however I still pad up each time and I cover all the popular spots - dome, knees, elbows, hands. Pain is the best teacher."
what was the reason for the fall? Is it usually because of the Terran like a pothole you didn't see? Are most skateboard not able to eat a pothole going fast?
I notice we don‚Äôt protect our shoulders. Why is that?
I wear a fox racing motor cross suit with shoulder pads. I got no shame about how I look and can care less when people point and giggle. ‚ÄúDress for the slide not for the ride‚Äù and all that
"They are expendable lol. But seriously, I think most people would put an arm out or something if they were about to land sideways. I‚Äôd rather land on my shoulder and have a bruise than a broken arm."
"That's like asking if you are going to crash your car someday.
Yes it's very likely that at some point you will come off your board, but if you are safe about how you ride then it will drastically minimize that chances.
I've been skateboarding for years and fallen off a ton, but after buying an electric skateboard I haven't crashed yet because ironically I think they are safer. Mainly due to having complete control over speed via acceleration and braking."
"This is correct, there are a ton of dorky gear heads in this sub who love to buy, talk and post pictures of said gear. Wear a helmet learn to ride you prolly won‚Äôt die"
"I sure have.
I run my dog with it. She is tiny but she loves to run between 15 and 22 mph. The eSkate is perfect for it.
Twice I have fallen. One time was her fault, she saw another dog that I did not see and wanted to say hi. Resulted in some bruises, cuts and scrapes for me. She made a new friend. The other dogs owner offered us a lift home because she was super nice and just saw me totally biff it.
The other time my board malfunctioned after getting wet. I kicked forward a few times and then tried to power forward. Instead it went backward and I hit the pavement hard. It would have been hilarious to watch. I wish I had it on video. I broke a rib on that one."
"Yesterday I fell off my skateboard and landed on my tailbone. I took 4 ibuprofen at 11 last night and 4 more today at 5-6pm. I can't go to the hospital. I can't lie to the doctors when they ask ''have you ever thought about hurting yourself?'' Becuse my mom has to be there with me (I'm a minor.) I already posted about this on r/nostupidquestions but it go taken down. I'm terrified and in pain, ik I should go to the hospital but I can't do that."
You need to go to the hospital and get it looked at. You‚Äôre there for a physical health issue they don‚Äôt give a shit about the SH

Dose anyone know of anything to make pain go away except more med bc those aren't working. My back of dieing and I want ir go go away üëπ
"You could have broken or fractured your sacrum or coccyx, trust me, you wanna get it looked at because if those don't heal properly it is hell"
"It's been awhile and I did end up going to the hospital almost a mouth later. I am 13 for context. I compression fracture in t11 and t12, ki have to wear a brace whenever I go somewhere and I'm waiting for a call from a spine clinic."
"Can you recommend a good knee, elbow and wrist guard set or individual ones suitable for use with E-Skateboards? (Faster speeds and help with impact on concrete and other surfaces) I‚Äôm looking atthese but not sure if it‚Äôs good or if there‚Äôs anything better out there. Don‚Äôt mind spending on these as I would rather this than break something."
"Long shot kinda, but I have bought from Bmx.co.nz for PPE. Same kinda stuff but not sure if what you are looking for."
"For skateboarding 187 pads are hands down the best, but also expensive. They have good padding and good fit. Protec are also quite good and have been around since the 70's.
The ones from bmx.co.nz don't have the plastic knee caps. That's ok for on dirt but not for concrete, you want them to slide.
The ones you've listed look pretty generic and are probably ok if you're not going very fast.
To be honest you really need to try them on for feel and fit. The sizing charts aren't all that reliable. I fit a large in 187 but medium in other brands."
As said as above make sure you get some decent quality ones as the fit is much better + materials are far more durable. My recommendation is get some hard shell knees + some g form elbows (they also do everything else but keep in mind these are more for impact not sliding on). Wrist guards are also excellent for a beginner before you learn to roll.
[TOMT] Skateboard Fall Video From a Few Years Ago
"My friends and I can‚Äôt find this skateboard video we saw on a meme page a few years ago. It‚Äôs a video with a kid skateboarding down a hill, his friend is recording from the bottom of the hill. He falls off his skateboard and slides into a curb. After that he is moaning and writhing in pain before an older man in brown crocs comes up to him to ask if he‚Äôs okay. Can anyone please help us find this? We‚Äôve been searching for years. Thank you!"
If anyone can help in anyway or point in the right direction because we have been completely stumped forever. Thanks again!
"Click here if you'd like to be notified when this post is solved.
Type 't7s12q' in the message subject if it hasn't already been filled in."
"Did he look like he knew what he was doing? Professional filming, or cellphone? Age? Obviously San Francisco, or suburban neighborhood? I‚Äôm privy and might be able to help you with some more detail"
"It was filmed on a cell phone, looked like an amateur skateboarder, it was in a suburban neighborhood and the guy filming and skateboarding were young teenagers"
If you're still looking for this the hallofmeat account on Instagram probably has it.

"For anyone wondering (found on Google) he suffered a fractured wrist, fractured vertebrae, bruised liver, bruised lung, ruptured spleen, whiplash and a concussion."
"He clearly died, his shoes came off"
"Following his recovery, Brown then won the gold medal in the Big Air event two years later at X Games L.A. and then defended his title in 2010.
What a champ!!"
AND HE WALKED AWAY FROM IT.
He's lucky just to be alive.
He‚Äôs also dead did you see his shoes fly off
Ruptured spleen can be deadly and it takes a long time to heal I hope he recovered good
"Saw this live on ESPN and to this day, I‚Äôm shocked they didn‚Äôt stretcher him off."
I didn't even know you could bruise your liver.
"hes fuckin lucky man, i thought he'd be paralyzed"
Bruh he survived the iconic ‚Äúshoes-come-off-your-dead‚Äù schtick
"I remember watching this live and thinking ‚ÄúShit, he‚Äôs dead‚Äù"
"Yo fr. Straight home after school, turn on the tv and first thing I see. Was the first few times I‚Äôve seen athletes munch it real bad. Just sat there cringing in disbelief"
