      "hear me out. now i have fantasy booked guys like mjf, danielson, wardlow, miro, kingston as potential winners of the battle royale - and while all those names would make for a fantastic match at the end of dynamite, i'm not sure any of those names in an improtu (unadvertised) main event with moxley - who is likely winning the match - would benefit aew's ratings or whoever takes the loss. most of those names - particularly wardlow and miro - should not be losing right now anyway.now perhaps i'm taking it for granted that moxley is winning on dynamite. between the built-in history between moxley and tanahashi, the fact he was the first person announced for this eliminator-style tournament (despite being # ranked before rampage aired) and the battle royale winner having to wrestle twice (giving them an automatic out for losing) - it just seems like a foregone conclusion that moxley will beat the battle royale winner on wednesday. so wouldn't it make sense to use that battle royale spot to elevate someone? someone who likely won't get a title shot against moxley and/or cm punk down the line? someone who will have a great match with moxley at the end of dynamite, but also won't be hurt by a loss (if it's in a competitive, brutal match)?with injuries to cm punk, kenny omega, adam cole (and potentially scorpio sky) - elevating someone unlikely feels like the smart move. aew has always done a great job of putting unlikely people in high profile spots and having them shine. darby allin against chris jericho (on one of the very first episodes of dynamite), jungle boy against kenny omega, orange cassidy against pac, private party against the young bucks, dante martin against kenny omega and the young bucks. a battle royale stipulation also means that nobody is going to look weak losing to an up and coming star. we've seen moxley have star-making matches with guys like wheeler yuta and daniel garcia of late - i would love to see the battle royale winner be someone unlikely.my # pick would be **ricky starks**. admittedly i'm bias - he's been one of my favourite wrestlers since his nwa days - but starks is a guy who feels like he's getting more and more over with every passing week. all he needs now is that one \"star making\" performance to push him over the edge. this could be it. i truly believe a blackpool combat club-style match (which we know he's capable of - thumbtack skateboard anyone?) with moxley would be what gets him there. we've seen the showmanship and flamboyancy of ricky starks - this would be an opportunity to see a more serious side of his wrestling persona. to see if he can be believably brutal and violent when in the ring with a pitbull like mox.another great option would be **swerve strickland**. he's someone who came in with a lot of hype, but didn't quite have the fanfare of the other recent ex-wwe signings (being that his entire nxt run was during the \"wednesday night wars\"). he's gotten great shine from being paired with keith lee and is starting to build momentum in his own right (after winning the triple threat against jungle boy and starks). a big-time main event dynamite match with moxley could be exactly what he needs to kickstart his singles career.there are so many incredible options up and down the roster for this spot. **buddy matthews** is another guy that we know is capable of star-making performances (anyone else remember his main event smackdown match against roman reigns a few years back? - now imagine if that momentum had been followed up on and wwe had done something with him off the back of it). he's someone who hasn't been given a singles match in aew yet and has explosive talent that the audience needs to be reminded of.**powerhouse hobbs** is another guy who looks ready to explode and a brutal match with moxley could be exactly what he needs. he's improved all facets of his game out of sight in the last  months and i think a singles match with moxley would go much different than his matches with moxley in .**kyle o'reilly** is someone coming off a big win against darby allin and, much to my surprise, looks like someone tony khan sees as a big player in the aew singles division. while i think there's much more value in redragon as a team, if you're wanting to put kyle o'reilly over big as a singles competitor, this would be a great way to do it. a match with moxley would definitely give him credibility with the aew audience (who have seemed lukewarm on him since his arrival).**lee moriarty** is someone that has been ear-marked for the bcc by fans and hasn't really been given an opportunity to show what he can do yet. i wouldn't be disappointed if he found himself in this spot - particularly considering the storyline ramifications off the back of it.just food for thought as everyone fantasy books this battle royale leading up to wednesday. i just really hope aew doesn't go for the obvious (and put someone who is already made in that spot). or use it as a vehicle to continue the jas vs bcc feud.there is plenty of time for jon moxley vs eddie kingston, jon moxley vs bryan danielson, jon moxley vs miro once the aew interim championship has been established. i don't think we need to rush those scenarios - particularly when the main event match won't be advertised ahead of wednesday.\n",
