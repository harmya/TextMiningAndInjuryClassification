"After a little searching, I located the right size filter for my Whirlpool refrigerator. I don't buy bottled water; I save tons of money by just ordering this filter twice a year and all of my drinking water is filtered through my refrigerator door, glass by glass, bottle by bottle. This filter does its job and makes my water taste very good. Also, I run about 2 quarts of water through it after installation to clear it out, per instructions, although I don't run quite as much as they suggest. Luckily, I live in an area with naturally soft water, so I don't have any issues with calcium deposits and such that some folks do. Overall, this filter performs well and delivers clean, fresh water any time I need it."
"I  bought this 2 pack  of  water  filters  to  replace  my  old  one. Samsung  site  is  pretty pricey  for  all  their replacement  parts and filters. Found  these  and  about  20.00  dollars  cheaper.  package  arrived  and  was as pictured on Amazon. The  process  of removing and  replacing  the  filter  is just  the same,  unscrew  the  filter, mark  the  new  filter with  month  sticker  in  the proper place,  screw  the filter  back  in and  use  a 1 gallon  jug,  cut the  top  of  a  bit  leaving  the handle for  holding  then  flush  the  filter  with at least  3  gallons  of water. I  go  the extreme  and  flush  5  gallons  from  my in-door  water dispenser. Note on  this  Samsung refrigerator only  1/2  gallon  comes out before  stopping.  so pull out  the jug and  then back in again  to  finish each gallon.  happy as a clam and have  one more  filter  for  the next  6 month replacement cycle."
These filters seem to be genuine Samsung filters.  we have been ordering from this provider for about 2 years and have never had a problem. Would definitely recommend them.
"Samsung has changed its design a number of times.  Not all filters that claim to fit some refrigerator models actually fit.  The problem is in the gasket arrangement.  If your original filter had 2 gaskets, make sure any replacement also has 2 gaskets or you'll be mopping  up your kitchen."
I got nervous because the Samsung website was sold out of replacement filters. This one fits perfectly and is working perfectly. Glad I was able to find it here.
"Since Home Depot fumbled my every six-month subscription for the delivery of a new water filter for my refrigerator, I ordered it from Amazon and received the correct filter on the same day for the same price! Unbelievable!  Correct filter, for a reasonable price, delivered to my door the same day - outstanding!"
We love this filter. It makes our water taste so good. It is easy to install.
"I have been using Samsung filters for 2 years now and never an issue,"
"El precio es muy alto, hay opciones mas económicas y similares"
Easy to install
"For the past year I have had problems with Samsung refrigerator water filters. I have used Amazon subscription service to provide a new filter every six months.  Last year one of the replacement filters had very slow flow and eventually stopped working.  I returned that one to Amazon and bought another Samsung filter locally.  That filter also had slow flow and then stopped working like the filter was clogged.  The replacement filter arrived from Amazon and it worked fine.  In December I received my semiannual filter delivery, and just installed it today.  Started off with a slow flow and the flow began to slow down even more.  Removed the filter and reinstalled it to see if that would help, but it did not.  At that point I compared the filter that had worked for six months and the new filter.  I also checked the reviews and found others had the same problem.  One review said Samsung had changed the filters and the new ones would not work because the hole in the filter was smaller.  Pictures taken for this review show both holes are 4mm.  However, if you look at the picture of both filters, and the individual pictures you will see that the older filter has a larger center section around the hole and has four support points stabilizing that section.  The newer filter has the smaller center section, but does not have the four supports equally spaced around the center section.  Instead there appears to be plastic slotted piece surrounding and supporting the center section.  Whether that slotted section is where the water enters or leaves it would greatly hamper the flow of water as it covers roughly one half (50%) of the opening.  My Samsung refrigerator is just over six years old the the new redesign of the water filter does not work properly in my fridge and apparently numerous other old fridges.  At $40.00 apiece and mostly new design filters on the market, do not order additional Samsung filters until Samsung fixes the problem.  Generic brand filters may be your only choice other than leaving the filters out altogether.  Really expect better from Samsung.  Amazon has been great exchanging one filter but I have two more newer filters that don’t work.  If you do purchase this filter for a Samsung fridge check the code on the upper right of the label on the filter.  You can do this before you break the sealed wrapper, and if the code looks like the dot matrix B0381 that is the older filter.  The stamped on EG22 is on the new filter.  The code number may change but the formatting should be the same.  Hope this helps some of you are having the same kind of problems and remember the filters are not clogging up, the newer design just doesn’t work.  Finally, my fridge is a Samsung RF26J7500SR, 26 cubic foot three door fridge.UPDATE:  After more than two hours on the phone with Samsung Customer service, a person in their E-Commerce Department, confirmed that last year Samsung changed the design of this model filter.  The individual I spoke did not know the reason for the change in design but these are usually cost cutting decisions since the model number remained the same.  All genuine Samsung filters have a small label on the back that has a pull-off strip that when placed on a magnet reveals a series of green stripes.  That same label has a QR Scan code that will verify the serial number on that label as a genuine Samsung filter. There is no solution for the filter problem for my model fridge or other older model fridges that use this filter and are having problems.  Newer Samsung fridges that use this filter apparently can handle the lower water pressure coming through the filter.  A tech in their parts and service department said it was probably to help control the splashing that occurs when you replace a filter.  Hope this helps."
Necessary product - fair quality and over priced
"Fridge Samsung, is a must have."
Only one we buy for our fridge.
"Perfect fit, easy installation."
I was very pleased not only of price but easy installation for me. Used this on my fridge
A Samsung part
after install make big noise when water go into ice make
I use this one every time I change it
I know that buying the filter from who makes your refrigerator will not fail. It is easy to install and a reasonable price.
No problem
"So thankful to have found filters for our Samsung refrigerator that don't cost an arm and a leg. We bought our house with this refrigerator already in it but the filter was bad, we replace it with one we bought at our local home improvement store but just that one filter cost around $80. 6 months later we were ready for a replacement and found this 3 pack for the same price as the single one we had previously purchased. The old filter and these are exactly the same and have been working well!"
The filter seems to work well. Be sure to turn off the water supply when changing filters or it may be very difficult to loosen.
"Good to have them from Amazon, they are a good price, and they come right to my door"
Like them
I’ve been using this for years and have never had any issues! Very easy to install too!
Price!
"This filter is pretty expensive compared to others on the market for my Samsung fridge so it's hard to know if the cheaper versions work just as well, but it seems well-made and comes with comprehensive installation instructions."
Purchased this product and WOW easy to install into a Samsung Refrig
Samsung products needed for Samsung merchandise.  Price needs to be adjusted down.
Works fine. Lasts for 6 months
"Nothing special, it gets the job done.  Good reliable product."
Easy to install.
This product is a commodity so that pricing is important.  We  bought it last year for $28 and paid $39 for it this year.  It's a water filter - what else is there to say for it.
The product is as described.
"Fácil, rápido y cómodo"
It makes the water taste really good
"Believe me, always buy the OEM replacement water filter.."
"After a bad experience with a ""highly"" rated aftermarket filter I went back to the factory original.  There's a reason why the manufacturer strongly suggests using their products.  I know that sometimes it's okay to buy aftermarket, but only if the specs meet or exceed the original.  I haven't found that to be the case with generic refrigerator filters.  Stick with the original and avoid the headache."
It works great just expensive but worth it
It works like it should. Thank you
"Lasts 6 months, water taste is good, and easy to install."
"We had just moved into our new home that had the filter light blinking on the fridge. I wanted to change that ASAP. Found the replacement filters on Amazon with free overnight shipping. They showed up the next morning! I couldn’t get the old filter out, but my boyfriend was able to do it with ease. The new one works great and my water taste so fresh!We have a Samsung RS25J500DSR."
"Well, anyone who owns a Samsung French Door Refrig with a POS Ice Room Ice Maker knows that even after applying all the fixes, they'll still be hair-dryer defrosting it, every ~3 months; I've got it down to ~15 minutes now.  So instead of buying a new refrigerator-with-ice-maker-in-the-freezer-drawer (at C0stc0), I decided to limp it along another year and buy another filter.  There's just the two of us in the household and I've calculated we dispense <300gal through the filter annually PLUS we have a clean water supply, so I ignore the 6 month reminder and replace it every December.The filter is a simple plastic 1/4"" thick, two piece plastic cartridge with 3 rubber o-rings, housing the carbon-filter insert. It's not difficult to disassemble the filter for recycling/disposal:1) remove the o-rings with an awl or precision mini bladed screwdriver. shake out the water.2) clamp the filter in a vise or brace appropriately3) (hack)saw 1/4"" deep around the diameter at the cartridge seam, about 1/3 up from the bottom.4) discard the carbon-filter insert and recycle the two plastic cartridge pieces.Maybe call your recycler and confirm they recycle Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) (7).Remember to run 3 gallons of water through your new filter. Maybe water the plants, fill a toilet tank, or clean the sinks and use it for rinse water."
"I have been buying my fridge filters at the local department store. I found the same ones on Amazon for less money. Easy to install, every six months. It says  you should run for 2 gallons of water through it before drinking, I do not run that much as that seems excessive before use. I run maybe a gallon."
Perfect
"If you own a Samsung refrigerator, get a Samsung filter. Better quality."
"Totally my mistake for not double-checking, but I wasted precious time with this product because the photo is for the wrong model. This product is model number HAF-CIN, not HAF-QIN. The photo shows HAF-QIN model filters."
Advertised 2 for 1 price.  Shipped out immediately with no shipping charges.  Is the exact style made for my fridge.
Easy to change
Have been using these for years. No complaints.
"Using my Zero Water digital result, it showed as 160. I had purchased off brand water filters which gave the same result. All of these filters(both off brand and Samsung) read higher numbers at first until they became saturated. This Samsung filter which is easily twice to three times the cost of off brand performed NO better than the others."
"Great value for the money, way cheaper than in-store. It’s easy to install. I’ve ordered multiple ones throughout the years and have never been disappointed."
Great price. Took out old water filter system and added this instead. Works good
I love the product. I bought it before. But it was very poorly delivered. It said it was on the front porch and it wasn’t. After several minutes looking for it I found it very far away from the front porch. In the bushes. This is the first time this has ever happened to me with Amazon and I’m a little disturbed that the way it was delivered
I bought the wrong size.  I was glad I was able to return it without any problems.
Easy to install and works well
"It’s fine. Really. I’m trying out the off brand replacement. We shall see how that works out.But I realize I was buying a pack of 3 for $116, and then, saw one for $25. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? I’m no mathematician but…hmm"
"Late last year I bought a fancy Samsung refrigerator - the model RF4289HARS.  It is the one with the 4 doors (actually two French doors on top, a middle drawer, and a bottom freezer drawer.  It has the water and ice dispenser on the left French door just under the snazzy blue led lighted touch control panel.  Anyway, the change filter light came on and so I removed the filter (it is really easy, just unscrew it a half turn and it comes right out) so I could see what the replacement part number on it said.  It was DA-29-00020A.  After looking around the internet, and looking on the Samsung website I found that there is no such part number - the closest thing I found was almost the same number only ending with B instead of A.  I called Samsung and after getting bounced to 3 different customer service people who had no idea whether part DA-29-00020B was the correct replacement for part DA-29-00020A and one customer service person who did not know that the filters are supposed to be changed after a while, I found a person who was able to tell me that DA-29-00020B is in fact the correct replacement filter for refrigerator model RF4289HARS.  I bought two of these filters - one to install now and one for a spare.  I put one in (it takes about 5 seconds to insert it and give it a half twist to the right to install it, and then I followed the instructions of running about a gallon of water through it.  You really do need to run this amount of water through it so get all of the air out of it so you get a smooth stream of filered water coming out.  I then reset the change filter light - you have to do this manually but all it takes is pressing and holding for 5 seconds (not the 3 seconds they tell you) the child lock/filter reset spot on the bottom left corner of the touch control screen just above the water/ice dispenser.  It works great now - tasty filtered water and flavorless crushed ice from my fancy refrigerator any time I want it."
"This product fits perfectly in my Samsung refrigerator. The price is good, and a lot less than the store where I bought my refrigerator. It came to my house quickly."
I called Samsung to find out what product I needed for my Family Hub.  Unfortunately they gave me this product which is incorrect.As 30 days had already passed I couldn’t return. May try to sell to someone else.Although some directions said you have to cut of PF the water supply line that was not necessary. That is why it took me longer to install as I finally called a plumber.
I know these are probably from China but so far the first one I've installed has functioned fine. We'll see if they last six months like the Samsung brand did.
"I hated to pay the price for this filter. $33 for a water filter you can buy for $17. I mean come on. But sadly, i have purchased a few of the off brand replacements. I was so frustrated with my fridge, I was contemplating calling a repairman. The water was just so slow to come out. I do not know why the cheap filters would slow the water down, but they did. Even a brand new off brand filter was slow. I finally thought I would replace my filter with the Samsung brand. If that did not work, I would call the repairman.Well, two notable things. It fits the socket properly. the off brand filters fit, but they did not fit perfectly. There was a large gap around the filter. This filter looked just like the one that came with the fridge. Probably because it was the same filter.Second, and most importantly, the water came out of the fridge so fast you could fill cups easily. The old filters had made this process so annoying that we dreaded filling water cups. I actually think we were drinking less water, just to avoid the hassle.This problem is solved.Before you say, well you just needed to replace your filter with a new generic filter and you would have seen the same results. Well, I replaced the first filter when the fridge told me to. I immediately noticed a reduced flow with the new replacement generic filter, form the old  Samsung filter (that the fridge just told me to replace). I bought a multi-pack, so I figured I would use them. I also questioned if the reduced flow was just my imagination. But it got more annoying as time went on. It even became a point of contention with other family members.This problem has been fully solved with the Samsung filter. The few dollar saving s is not worth the hassle of the generic filters. I did only try one brand, so maybe you can find a generic brand that will work for you.My plan is to use the Samsung filters, and ignore the filter change light. I will replace the Samsung filter whit a new filter when the water flow actually slows down. I would guess they could go a year or more in my area. One of my neighbors has a 2 year old fridge. I noticed how fast their water came out. I asked what kind of filter they had. They said, ""these have filters?""SO my assessment is buy good filters. Replace them when they need it, not when the calendar tells you. that way you can spend a little extra for a good one."
Works as expected
it was easy to install came in a timely matter now I have clean filtered water
I order these filters every 6 months as the fringe remind me. They are easy to install - just make sure to take the plastic cap off first!
Main refrigerator for family
Does what it says on the box
I’ve been paying twice as much for a generic filter at Loews! This is a great deal!
"Ordered this product based on the model number of my refrigerator. It fits into the housing and does not leak. But it is about 2"" longer than the original filter, so we have to be careful not to hit it when accessing the items in the fridge."
Fits right out of the Box.
Glad I could find genuine samsung filters at a greatly reduced price.
Otherwise your appliance will not work correctly
"It's my fault, but I ordered the wrong model number. Couldn't figure out why it wouldn't install easily.  Waited too long and missed the return deadline. Now I have a perfectly good filter that I can't use. I have ordered the correct filter now."
"I've been using the same filter for years in my fridge.  Bought another replacement and it doesn't fit.  I replaced it last night before bed, woke up this morning and water was all over my kitchen floor.  I checked to make sure it wasn't leaking last night after replacing it, but it was a slow enough leak that it wasn't noticeable until 9 hours later.  now the trim on my wall is all bubbled up from sitting in standing water overnight.  Looked at other reviews this morning and found everyone is right and that Samsung changed the design of the filter.  I held it up to the filter I replaced and sure enough, it's different.  Put the old filter back in this morning and it hasn't leaked since.  It's uneffing real how they can change the design, so it no longer works in my fridge.  I hate Samsung so much as my oven stopped working 3 years after purchasing it.  Called numerous oven repair companies in my area and everyone of them said they strictly will not work on Samsung ranges as they're garbage.  I couldn't believe with how popular Samsung is, all of them said that's the only brand of range they won't work on.  After the fridge filter leaking due to them just changing the design, I will never ever buy any Samsung appliance again.  Just bought a new tv last week and so glad I went with LG instead, so I'm not giving Samsung money for that either.  I 100% made sure all model numbers matched on the new filter from the older filter, so I've already confirmed it's the same filter as before.  Samsung just decided to change the design.  I honestly don't know how they can legally do that.  What if I would've gone on vacation last night?  I would've had so much water damage.  Luckily I hopefully caught it before anything serious happened, but who knows how much water leaked behind the baseboard."
"Great tasting water, easy install, and lasts twice as long as it says."
"Seems to be fine. Our old one that came with the fridge didn't seem to be slow when the water was coming out so I never thought it needed changing after the change water sign came out on the control panel. Apparently, it's a timer that measures 6 months time I believe.  Whether you use a lot of water and ice or don't, everyone's change filter alert cones out at The same time. Mine is a Samsung fridge. So I took the filter out to look at it and figure out which to order here online.  I must've not put it back correctly because there was leakage that I thought was just table spoons and contained to the under the crisper area. That was until I noticed my new wood floors getting warped.  After much investigation I found The water had made its way down and then trickled over each one of the front rolling wheels.  I thought the leaking was due to the filter being more than 6 months old but it wasn't. When I replaced it with one of these new ones and followed the directions carefully there was a suction sound I hadn't heard before and that's how I knew I had put it in wrong the first time. Confirmed by the fact that there was no more pools of water. So both my old filter and this new one fit fine. Make sure you insert and lock it correctly. What I'm still baffled about is why both filters had the same water flow speed if one is ""too old"". I'm ok with the speed but at one point during the cleaning flushing the filter that they recommend it did at one point pour water forecefully.  It may have been that the filter was still filling with water.  I would've preferred if the water continue to flow that way but that's okay, it's not as if it's too slow now, it still fills a small glass in less than 15 seconds.  The only thing that gets me is the different codes on these filters. I made sure, although the labels don't look identical, that they do have the same filtering specs.  Be careful as other filters being offered for less (may have different brand or incorrect spelling) may not be cleaning the same things off the water as the filter that came with your fridge.  I'm going to leave mine in for a year as we don't use it as much as a bigger family would . I still have two left."
"Great price, and I will reorder until my refrigerator dies, so please do not raise the price too much.Thanks for making this possible for us."
Easy install. Clean and clear ice cubes says it all.
"Be sure to check your filter as soon as it arrives, it should have tamper-proof plastic around the filter.  The filter I received today was previously installed…gross and potentially a health issue."
fit perfectly  no problem
Easy to install.
Works as advertised……recommend
Very effective at removal of after tastes !!!!!!!
Siempr uso como filtro de agua en casa exelente
Refrigerator water filter
Easy to install
It’s for my Samsung refrigerator.  Good price for the double pack
I like this product
Good Product
"Great filters. These are legitimate Samsung filters, so there's no reason they shouldn't be good. Especially for the price! Installation is kind of annoying, took me about 15 minutes from start to finish. I had to use a pair of pliers to grip the old filter and twist to get it unlocked. There was obviously so much gunk built up in there that I couldn't get it untwisted by hand. Then I tried installing the new filter, but the water pressure made it impossible, so I went ahead and shut off the water supply to the house. With the water supply off, installing the new filter was easy. It just popped right in and locked in place. I turned the water supply back on and emptied out about 3 gallons of water as instructed. That part was very boring, I just kept filling and dumping jugs.I haven't conducted a water quality test of the tap water vs the filtered water, but just from the taste alone, it seems like the filter is working. Or maybe it's a placebo effect, who knows haha. Depending on how often you use your water dispenser, they last up to 6 months. I drink A LOT of water every day, and I let the last filter go the full 6 months before changing. That's probably why it was so hard to remove, because they were totally filled with pollutants at that point. You can also tell when they need to be changed because the water comes out a lot slower.I've had this fridge for years and we've been through tons of these filters. I took off a star because I honestly think they cost way too much. It's just a water filter! Why does it need to cost almost $50? There was one time these were $35 on Amazon, and I thought that was a great deal...but of course now the price has gone back up. Anyway, these are good and they work, so go ahead and get them if you need new filters. I've read horror stories from people buying the off-brand water filters and it breaking and flooding the house, so I'm gonna stick to the Samsung brand."
Eazy
We used it for our refrigerator.
Had been using cheaper filters but I went back to Samsung brand for my Samsung refrigerator to eliminate “chattering” and increase water flow.
Easy to replace
It was very fast to arrive and easy to install
"This is an OEM part.  I trust it for top quality.  I continue to wonder each time I order another filter whether the non-OEM brands are just as good.  I don't know how to judge that.  So I'll continue to buy the OEM Samsung filter b/c it was designated for the Samsung refrigerators by Samsung.  Though it's expensive, the cost isn't killing my budget."
"After doing some thorough research, I decided to get the ANSI 53 filter which really had a much better tasting water than the ANSI 42 filter that was replaced, which was the standard filter in the refrigerator.  NSF/ANSI 42 covers aesthetic reduction claims while NSF/ANSI 53 covers health-related reduction claims, and thus a better tasting water.  I am glad I invested a few dollars more for a better and healthier filtered water.NSF/ANSI Standard 42 covers POU and POE systems designed to reduce specific aesthetic or non-health-related contaminants (such as chlorine, taste and odor, and particulates) that may be present in public or private drinking water. The scope of Standard 42 is to establish minimum requirements for material safety, structural integrity, product literature, and aesthetic, non-health related contaminant reduction performance claims.NSF/ANSI Standard 53 addresses POU and POE systems designed to reduce specific health-related contaminants that may be present in public or private drinking water. Standard 53 establishes minimum requirements for material safety, structural integrity, product literature, and health related contaminant reduction performance claims. NSF tests and certifies under Standard 53 if a filter system reduces a significant amount of a specific harmful contaminant from drinking water. Such hazardous contaminants may be microbiological (including filterable cysts), chemical (including disinfection byproducts, pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides), or particulate in nature. NSF may certify that a DWTU may be effective in controlling one or more of the health effects contaminants. By carefully reviewing the performance data sheet for a product, you will be able to determine whether the device is effective in reducing many pollutants or just a few.Hope the above details clarifies the difference between the two carbon filtration systems and explains why I chose the latter.As for replacing the filter it took less than 20 seconds, just remember to remove the seal at the end of the filter before snapping it in and turning it to lock it in place."
One of the best filter. Good price and product is original.
They fit and don’t leak.
It is great so far in my refrigerator.
"These filters are a bit pricey at over $30 a pop, although that is on par with other brands.  Amazon is definitely the place to buy these though, as stores tend to charge $40+.  Depending on how much ice and water you use from your fridge, you will have to replace them at least every 6 months.  We use ice at the rate of a few glasses a day, but rarely use the water from the fridge as we have a separate water filter at the sink.  After about 5 months, I could tell the ice was getting that ""funny taste"".  I ordered one of these filters, changed it and back to the great tasting ice we were.I have the Samsung RF4287HARS fridge and this is the correct model filter for it.  Changing it is incredibly easy:  just shut the water off, twist out the old filter and twist in the new one, then run a gallon or so of water to clear the filter of carbon dust and to remove air from the lines.  I believe you can install this without turning the water off, but I'm paranoid of that so I shut it off.As a note, when ordering one of these keep an eye on the price of this versus the 3-pack: 
Samsung DA29-00020B Refrigerator Water Filter, 3-Pack
.  Depending when you hit it, there may be significant savings in the 3-pack or it may be cheaper to order the single.  The price seems to fluctuate daily. In my case, it would've cost an extra $2 for each filter to order the 3-pack, so I went with the single.  It looks though that the 2-pack is always more expensive, so avoid that.Overall these are very convenient to install and work well.  Spending almost $70 a year just to filter water for a fridge though is a bit extreme, so I give it 4 stars."
I have no complaints with this water filter. Here is a story worth telling that I hope is helpful for anyone looking for an off brand replacement cartridge that you could find in the major home improvement stores.  I wanted to save money so I bought the off brand.  It was a very easy install.  a few hours later I opened the fridge and it was like Niagara Falls pouring out on me.  The darn thing split open.  I was mopping up water for an hour on my hardwood floors.  It was obviously not built to the proper specs.  Lesson learned.  I would only purchase the OEM of this filter.
We had been having trouble with our water supply from the refrigerator for awhile and had tried changing the filters a lot sooner than we should have. Finally realized the cheap filters were the problem!  Switched back to genuine Samsung filters and no more problems.
Gotta really push hard to install.  I had to use pliers to push and twist.
"I live in Florida where the city water is average at best.  It is recommended to replace the refrigerator water filter every three months, which I agree with.  Easy to do."
"As much as I hate having to buy the more expensive filters, the generic ones leak and will make a huge mess! Spend the extra money and get the real ones or else you'll be cleaning up water every day! This is the best price for these I've found as well."
"Señores... muy facil de instalar, la nevera la tengo en Colombia y sin ningun problema... la opcion que te presenta amazon en donde tu pones la referencia de la nevera es algo q te da una tranquilidad absoluta al comprar.  Muy recomendado... el sabor no tiene ningun cambio"
It didn't come with the authentication sticker and the replace filter light still on ( already tried resetting it).
The filter started off fine at first. Then after a couple of weeks we started to notice water on our fridge drawer. We dried it up and later found more water. I went to the store where I bought the refrigerator and purchased a new filter and the leaking is over.
Very good
I am quite surprised how great this water tastes. Easy to use and NO charcoal color comes out when you first use the filter. I actually compared to a Samsung filter and it appears to be higher quality.
"First let me say this review is for the actual product and not Amazon. Their customer service, as usual, has been excellent.We have a 2010 Samsung refrigerator (model: RS263TDPN/XAA) and according to the manual and all on-line resources the replacement water filter is the DA29-00020B (aka the HAF-CIN/EXP).  For all these years we've owned this fridge we've bought our filter from Amazon and have never had an issue with the product.  So what does Samsung do, they go and change the design of the cartridge (ever so slightly) and now it doesn't work.The slightly redesigned filter no-longer works on my particular model fridge.  Let me just clarify one point, the filter does fit into the slot properly however the water DOES NOT FLOW.  I tried a dozen times installing it with and without the water turned off.  Every time the filter would screw in but no water.  Thinking perhaps it was a bad batch from Amazon, I even went to Home Depot and Best Buy and bought one from each of them but the issue was the same.I've spent several hours on the phone with both Samsung support and with J & J International (the company Samsung uses for ALL their parts).  Samsung support says it's not their problem because there is nothing wrong with the fridge itself. Since the issue is with the filter it's J & J's problem.  Well, J & J says they build the cartridges to match the specs given to them by Samsung so it is in fact their problem.  They also denied any changes to the design of the cartridge!  This back-and-forth was so ridiculous it was like something from an SNL skit!For those thinking ""what design changes"", or ""is he nuts, they look the same"" I'm attaching some photos showing the filter i purchased last year and the one from two weeks ago.So basically I'm not sure what to do!  I am still using the filter from last year (which is working like a champ still).  Was thinking about trying a third-party filter but not sure if that's wise."
Awesome
I like my Samsung fridge filter. Easy to install
So far they are working just great.
Did a good job
Trust them and they fit and are easily removed and installed.
"GREAT filter! I had been using a knock off filter with no problems for years. The last filter I received just looked a little short to m. One worked fine. The second one, after installing it, gave no ice nor water called repair person. He was professional and said my ice maker motor had failed. He replace the motor and we were back in business.within3 days the water and ice quit working again. I tried replacing filter with my last back up filter. Again, worked 3 days and stopped. I recalled repairman as it was still under repair shop 90 day warranty. A few days before the second repair visit, I ordered an original Samsung filter and installed it. Both ice and water started working perfectly. I waited till the last possible moment to cancel my service appointment. That has been over 2 months now and everything is working Great‼️"
A little pricey but I have to have it...
What came was the real deal with the authenticity check in the box. Purchased when price was in the $60s which was a great deal. No issues.
I use this Samsung  filter for the water dispenser in my refrigerator. I replace it every 6 months.
My water  for my Samsung Refrigerater was delivered the same day it was ordered ! The instructions were easy to follow ( repeat purchase ) and was easy to install! Thank You Amazon !
Lasted more than 6 months per unit
Expensive
"The filter arrived in a taped plastic bag. It normally arrives in a Samsung box with instructions, a set of date labels, and is usually shrink wrapped.Hard to trust something that appears to have been previously opened."
Was Okay.
Filter is the correct water filter for our Samsung fridge
Get in on sale
Great value
Nothing
"A lot of replacement filters for Samsung refrigerators don’t remove lead.  These do, and they are OEM by Samsung.  Just make sure they fit your specific model because there are lots of variations.  Paying less will get you less.  Also, I have found that these filters perform well for a full year (no reduction in water flow or effectiveness—the water still tastes good).  Of course, it depends upon your water supply and size of your family, but don’t think you automatically must replace the filter every 6 months unless you experience a reduction in flow or quality.  Finally, these OEM filters are a lot cheaper here from Amazon.com than from the big box stores, and for some reason, buying a two-pack is cheaper than buying a three-pack!  Go figure...."
Works as expected no leaks
"Good product, will buy again"
"Nothing to dislike. Same product as sold in major hardware stores, only I did not have to drive 70 miles to buy it."
This was as expected
"I am cautious on purchasing water filters and will not purchase a filter with non specific purity standards listed.  And, I trust Samsung."
Fantastic Price for an original Manufacturer item
Exelente
"Filters our water and ice well. Hard to find at Best Buy or other stores, kinda expensive. Water always leaks everywhere when changing, and have to flush too much water through it to get it started."
Under sink filter
"I was VERY skeptical of this product after reading several reviews alleging this was somehow a counterfeit product. Long story short, this product is just as advertised and works perfectly.A few reviews I read mentioned that OEM filters are made in Korea, compared to this ""counterfeit"" which is made in Mexico. When I opened the box, the first thing I did was check to see where it was made. This product is indeed made in Mexico, so I was highly disappointed at first and fully expected to have to send this back. But I took out my OEM filter to replace with this one, and to my surprise, the original product in my refrigerator was also made in Mexico. After seeing this, I decided to give it a try. I listened very closely for any ""strange noises"" coming from the fridge that other reviewers said occurred when using this filter. Nothing. There were no strange sounds, no lack of water pressure, absolutely nothing happened, and there was no change to my fridge after installing with this Amazon product.My only guess is that people are not choosing the correct part number for their refrigerator. Samsung doesn't make it super easy to find the exact model numbers of their units, so maybe this is the cause of the bad reviews. If you match your model number with this filter, you will have no problems with this product. Highly recommended, especially for the low price compared to local retail stores."
"I have not used the water dispenser on my Fridge for a while. WHY, you ask. Because Samsung screwed the pooch and changed the design without checking to see how it impacted refrigerators already in homes. I have purchased a number of replacement filters from places like Home Depot and Lowes, and these are supposed to be good but they were not. Turns out the hole at the top of the filter was reduced in size by SAMSUNG causing them to impeded flow and fail to operate properly. The whole on the filter I just received is back to the proper size and now works properly YEAH!!!So I struggled to score this review because I think people with bad experiences will check low scores but I decided to score as things are today. I WANTED TO GIVE SAMSUNG 0 stars for hiding the truth of this situation and for deciding to sell through bad stock rather than recall and replace filters."
"We just had our icemaker replaced under warranty from certified Samsung technicians. They recommend using OEM water filters due to the lower output pressure requirements required to operate the icemaker in its intended manner. We now have unlimited ice and so far, trouble free!"
Very easy to use and works great
Works great and was shipped quickly
great original direct replacement filter
This is a genuine Samsung water filter!
"Replacement for Samsung Refrigerator filter. According to the manual only Samsung filters should be used. When replacing the old one the prior owners of my house used a another brand. This is an the correct filter for the refrigerator, although the other brand never had a problem."
Easy to install and a lot cheaper than buying at the store.
Great filters... I plumbed ro to fridge and took out this filter..  one day later the water from the fridge was tasting a bit funky like freezer burn metallic almost.  I quickly realized that the taste was coming from the fridge as a result of sitting and chilling inside of the coiled up tubing.. so even though the ro water has no taste the fridge was adding a bad taste..  I added this filter back into the mix which immediately removed the fridge added taste and the water is terrific.  Hoping that since clean water is going into this filter that it will remain effective at removing the funky fridge taste for at least 1 year.  These are pretty expensive for a carbon filter.
"Cost always great, have reordered several times and always satified."
"Yes, it is pricey but we just tried a ""generic"" filter and it lasted all of 2 months.  Sucked it back up and bought another Samsung OEM filter.  Our water totally tastes better than the generic filter.Save your pennies, buy OEM if you want great water that does last what it says it does.  Our city water is the worst and we cannot drink out of the tap due to the amount of chemicals and smells etc.  It is a combination of well water and lake water and it's just awful.  We ONLY drink water out of our Fridge, same for our pets.  The Samsung filter is just better and worth it.We won't cheat on the fridge again.  She forgave me."
"After reading many reviews about this possibly being a knock-off, I was skeptical when I ordered, knowing I could return it if it didn't seem right upon arrival.  The box and product seemed perfectly legit.  I watched a YouTube video on how to install the filter and did it without any problems.  I turned off the water valve to the fridge before I changed the filter (it was easy for me to get to because it's under the kitchen sink and comes from the R/O unit...I know it would have been harder to turn off the water to the fridge if not).  It's been 4 days since changing the filter, and I haven't had any leaking as mentioned by other reviewers."
I used compatible filtered
Factory replacement for your Samsung refrigerator water and ice dispenser. All others are not made equal in the chemical contaminants and hard water minerals they will remove. If you want to keep your ice maker in great operating condition and drink clean tasting water with no hard water minerals or smell of foul odor use only theses factory originals. The cheap so-called compatible filters just don’t compare and are a waste of money.
No complaints.  Delivery fast and timely.
"This is a very good product although overpriced. If you look at the competition, you don't know what you're getting when you buy from them, and that is the only reason I bought these. Competitors are small knock off brands made in China so you don't know what you're getting. There's no point to skimping on a water filter. My only other complaint is that my Samsung refrigerator tells me to replace these twice per year and there are only two of us in the household. I doubt it's actually measuring use, but rather time. For two people, I change it annually regardless of what the sensor tells me to do."
Good water filter; easy to install.
Easy install
Easy to install.  Water tastes good and is very clear.
"[Added result. I found an older filter from a previous order, and weighted it. TWO OUNCES heavier than these three! Hard to understand why Samsung would cut costs at the contempt for their customers?! Well, former customers?]Bought many of these over some number of years, but this recent batch is worse than useless. If I get water from the kitchen sink, the aerator removes some chlorine. If I get water from the refrigerator, the chlorine taste and smell is . . . well, think of a swimming pool. A warning sign was the lack of carbon fines in the filter purge water. Somebody used the term ""sediment"" for what I am calling carbon fines . . . the completely normal and expected reason you purge a new filter. Since the most recently installed filter had none, and since it fails to improve the taste of the water, I wonder of the filter media was never installed? Anybody know the tare weight of a new cartridge? I'd rather not bother to install replacement filters that don't have filtration in them. Very disappointing to get nasty-tasting water from a brand new filter. Shame on Samsung, huh?"
"This brand name water filter worked great.  I had installed a ""fake"" filter that was labeled as Samsung, but it was not.  It made my whole water line rumble!  I tried a second one (also fake label) and same thing.  I scheduled a repair person then got to thinking when the trouble started.  Took out the filter and ran water without it...no noise.  Ordered this real Samsung brand and all is well.  Saved a service call!  And...the Samsung filter came with a method to identify if it was a knock off or the real deal."
This fit well into my refrigerator. It appears to be a genuine product with the authenticity magnet. No leaks. Water flow is much stronger now.
"Our Family has been using this product over 4 years now. I order it every year , comes in a pack of 2 which last one year . Good flavor and can’t complain since our tap water is not drinkable and other options like water treatment were  too expensive to go with , this one works great for a family of 4 and one order of 2 filter easily last a year.  Only reason I gave 3 stars  to ‘easy to install’ criteria was because every install is a bit of a work especially when we have to remove the existing filter to replace with the new filter. The grip at the hold top is not Deep enough  especially for big hands , we end up using the pliers to push it and pull out. But no complaints other wise."
"Direct replacement for my new Samsung Refrigerator stock filter. Some reviews suggest this may not be the real deal but these looked good to me.  Not an exact version of what shipped with my fridge but my car oil filter is not an exact copy of what shipped with my car either. All looks legit Samsung OEM to me as I bet Samsung subs these out anyway. The box, packing, print all looked good and in no way made me think a cheep knock off or anything.  I feel these are a 100%  Samsung product.Installed easy, water is clean and clear and the red light is now off on my fridge and I save a $ over the local big box so Im happy!I do wish refrigerator filter were rated for more than the 300 gal or so and last longer as when you think about the cost vs gallons refrigerator filters are very expensive; Like printer cartridges, I am sure big profit for the manufacture. I witnessed a line of folks buying these at the big box and thought what a scam. Remember the days that you did not need a filter?I cannot change the world so if your red light is on and you do not want to use Ice trays ( remember those)  I do recommended this product as we must have ice and water right?"
I trust the genuine samsung water filter but a little bit pricey. Easy to install.
We have been using this refrigerator filter since we bought the Samsung refrigerator a few years ago. It has worked well.
"This certainly appears to be an OEM Samsung filter made in Korea. I just changed my filter for the first time and the one that came with the refrigerator was labeled 'fresh water'.  It indicated that it filtered chlorine and particulate Class III, which is NSF/ANSI Standard 42, an aesthetic effect.  The box for my replacement filter was labeled 'fresh water', yet the filter itself was labeled 'mineral water', describing multiple things it filters, which is NSF/ANSI Standard 53, health effects and a much higher standard.Without knowing more, it would appear the 'mineral water' filter does much more in the way of filtration, but the quality control in packaging is lacking here, as neither is provided or listed as a choice when purchasing and in my case, the box indicated one and the filter itself the other.That said, so far I am very happy with this purchase.  It fits correctly, no leaks have developed and it appears to be working as it should.  I believe the 'fresh water' filters are intended for city water supplies and the 'mineral water' filters are intended for those who have a well-water supply.  If anybody has more information I would be happy to review it.  Regardless, accurate descriptions should be listed for these different options and appropriate choices should be listed."
Hard to find locally so this was a great save for us!
"This is genuine Samsung and that’s what I wanted so met my expectations.  I do think this filter is hard to install, but that’s Samsung refrigerator maker issue and not the fillers. Filters work as expected."
"It was a replacement.  What can I say?  It does as it is designed.  Hopefully.  I mean, how do we really know?just adding a little humor"
Changing out the old filter to the new was a breeze.
Have been using these for a few years and they work ok
It’s actually a Samsung filter and it’s a great deal for your money ! It was the exact one that my frig required but I do suggest if your able to pull out your frig easily to turn off the water then do !I have a rather large heavy frig and had to install with the water hooked up and it was a bit difficult other than that no complaints !
"I purchased this in November 2016 for my Samsung side by side model RSG307AARS. I had no visible/taste issues or leaking as some people have posted. I am not sure if the one here is counterfeit or just a previous version but I just purchased the same filter directly from Samsung in July 2017 (for the same price and free shipping) and there were visible differences in packaging and labels.  The physical structure of the filter, including hole size appears identical. I don't still have the package from the one purchased on Amazon but the one I got from Samsung doesn't look like the picture posted here. The first two pictures are of the filter I purchased here (note the Samsung name is in black on the filter) and the top view.  The next 8 pictures are of the one I purchased from Samsung directly.  Note it says on both the printed box and with a metallic sticker that it is a genuine Samsung filter.  The filter itself has similar information but I noticed on both the box and filter, the word Samsung was in blue print (without the oval background) and the letter A was an upside down V which is similar to their brand identity."
"As far as comparing this authentic filter to the generic Chinese knockoffs, there is a substantial and measurable purification of the water with this filter. Even when I was told to replace it the filter was still functioning to a level that exceeded that of the crappy Chinese versions. If you want to save money I would just keep this filter in for 2-3 times longer than recommended rather than buying the completely functionless Chinese versions that are cheaper but offer virtually no filtration whatsoever.  When I tested several of my knockoff filters I was blown away when I couldn't get even a difference of 30 in the TDS (total dissolved solids) measurement. I think it was more like 10 or even zero most of the time. I definitely would not waste money on a knockoff filter because you're basically buying something that does almost zero (maybe alters the taste slightly) whereas this filter actually does something. It also feels heavier, which suggests to me that it contains more filtration media, which could explain why it actually filters something versus nothing. This still isn't a great water filter in general, and if you really want the cleanest water you will need to opt for something that doesn't come out of the fridge or connects to the water supply and filters it from there."
Lo mejor y económico con respecto al precio e n colkmbia
Best price. Beats Home Depot or Lowes
"I purchased the top of the line Samsung refrigerator 11 months ago.  The new refrigerator came with the initial filter.I noticed immediately that my drinking water and ice cube quality had improved substantially.There was such an improvement in the taste, smell, and odor of my water that when the filter needed replacing, I noticed the difference immediately.It was definitely the water filter.  I could not drink the water once the filter expired.  The red light came on and my dislike for tap water revived.I went to the hardware store to purchase a new filter and the price was through the roof.  I also went online to the Samsung website and the price was even more excessive.I decided to check Amazon, and I got a terrific deal on the 3 pack refrigerator water filter.  I saved money, eliminated the use of bottled water, and fell back in love with the quality of my water.Thus far, I have had 3 filter replacements in an 11 month time period.  I'm sure if you have a larger family, you may have to replace it more often.This is a superb product that is saving me money.  I don't have to purchase bottle water and deal with that terrible plastic taste and odor.I also feel safer because I don't have to deal with the possible toxic side effects of plastic."
Good product
Filter is exactly as described.
"WANTED TO GET A EXTRA FILTER BECAUSE I FORGET WHEN TO REPLACE IT  AT THE CORRECT TIME , SO I GOT THE 3 PACK FO CONVENIENCE"
""
Work as intended!
"The water in my Samsung refrigerator tastes wonderful after being filtered by this filter.  This filter fits snugly into the receptacle and was simple to install.  The instruction sheet that came with the filter is very busy making it difficult to read.  The font size is somewhat small because the information is published in several different languages which takes a lot of space.Recently, being game for a bargain, I purchased a inexpensive filter that was about 1/3 the price of this one.  The water tasted like it was coming out of a cheap plastic hose leaving an awful taste in our mouths.  We couldn't stand the cheaper filter so we went back and purchased this genuine Samsung filter.  My bargain ended up costing me more because I threw the inexpensive filter away long before it was time.  Learn from my experience and go ahead and buy the more expensive Samsung filter instead of trying to save a few dollars.  Or don't take my word for it and go find out for yourself.  I guarantee that if your experience was like mine that you will be back to purchase a Samsung filter."
"These are hard to find as BB seems to keep running out of them.  Glad I could find them, not the cheapest, but they are the original product and work just fine."
Pricewise ok but I think the water tasted a bit different even after using for few weeks. No issues for set up and shows its a genuine one but except the taste.
"Ok, my mouth has no filter but I do have a filter for my Samsung fridge.  I love that I can get the filter from Amazon.  This is the exact filter I bought from the big box hardware store at a better price.  And half the time I went to the hardware store, they were out of this filter.  I have had a difficult time installing this filter a time or two.  MAKE SURE to remove the protective cap from the new filter BEFORE you put it into the filter slot.  I had to pull the throw away protective cap out of the back of the slot with a pair of chop sticks."
When purchasing you’re limited by the make and model of ur fridge. The water from my fridge filtered through this is noticeably better than out of my tap so I assume it’s doing a great job
great product
"Good product, easy to use"
I'm picky about my water and this filters work great on cleaning the nasty taste from Florida water.
"This was indeed a genuine Samsung product and was very easy to install.I bought it for my RF260BEAESR and it fit great.  Some have said it would not work and they would have to get a service company to make changes, but this was not true fo this model.I spent a little more for the genuine Samsung one, but I just wasn't sure what to think of the others due to seals and connections.  I wanted it to fit right.I would buy again and recommend."
"Got these for our Samsung refrigerator.  Filter is easy to replace.  No leaks yet.  Just wish they were priced more fairly - filters you can install in your cold water line that perform at least as well and have at least the same capacity, are cheaper."
Thesecare the original Samsung replacement filters.
"After doing a bit of research on these filters I found that you can't even compare the quality of a brand name filter like Samsung to many of the generic filters.  It seems that not all filters are created equal and many of the generic filters do not filter out all the particles and chemicals that the Samsung water filters do.  They are not created equal and in addition the generic filters can be a little off in their sizing and many of the comments I read about them say that there was a water leak with them as a result.  A few comments also stated that the generic filters did not turn off the light that comes on when it is time to replace the filter.  I did not want to take the chance of a water leak with such a quality refrigerator and when you figure out the cost per day difference, it just isn't worth the savings.  Why risk the quality of drinking water just to save a few pennies!  It is still cheaper than buying bottled water and much better for the environment.  To save money I suggest buying them in bulk rather than using an inferior water filter.  There can be quite a price difference between sellers, so do your homework and research!  Some charge for shipping and handling and others do not!"
"Perfect replacement for the filter in my Samsung refrigerator.  It took a bit of research to make sure I was getting the right filter as there were several models with different part numbers listed that supposedly worked in this application.  Fortunately this one worked perfectly even though it had a different part number.Installation:Replacing these filters literally takes seconds.  Screw out the old one and screw in the new one.  Wipe up a few drops of water that spills and you're done.  Don't forget to reset the reminder light on the refrigerator.  Then run at least a gallon of water through the filer to flush out any impurities from the manufacturing process.  I used a large water glass that I refilled several times and dumped in the sink.  The filtered water tastes great  (no chlorine, etc.) and seems to flow faster than the original filer that was probably starting to clog up from filtering so much water..The only con is that the Samsung OEM filters are expensive for what they are and have to be replaced every 6 months.  I would give it 5 stars except for the price."
"Exactly what I needed.  The water in the fridge was coming out verrrrrry slowly and the ice maker wasn't making enough ice.  I ordered this and it arrived the next day.  It took less than a minute to remove the old one and install the replacement.  Only a couple drops of water needed wiping up and otherwise no mess.  Now everything is working right and the water tastes nice and clean.If your fridge water seems to run slow, you probably need to replace the filter.  There are some off-brand ones that are cheaper, but this isn't too expensive and I prefer knowing I have a real filter and not a knock-off."
"I have had no issues with these water filters. They have performed as expected. I’ve read some reviews that mentioned these filters leaked. I suspend those reviewers either received counterfeit filters, or they didn’t install them correctly. It’s inconvenient, but Samsung does instruct you to shut the water supply off to the fridge before replacing the filter, and failure to do so can result in leaking.You may be tempted to go with a cheaper 3rd party water filter, but I suggest you compare the NSF certifications the 3rd party filters have. Most, if not all, have lower certifications than what the genuine Samsung filters offer. I didn’t find any, for instance, that were certified to filter out pharmaceuticals in the water supply (NSF 401). You may save money on a third party filter, but you’re getting an inferior product."
"I love this company!!! One Day Delivery as promised! Easy installation! Depending on your local water source, follow instructions for CLEAR water to dispense! I dispensed approximately 1 gallon of water before it was clear! This company is the BEST! GENUINE Samsung water filter! BEST PRICE TOO!!! Keep up your GREAT EFFORT!"
"The item I ordered was easy to install, perfect size, affordable and I will order again."
perfect fit for our refrigerator.
Fixed the taste problem.  Will definitely buy again.  Good value for the money.
The water taste really good this filter does not change the water flavor like other one I’ve tried
"When we have to replace these filters (regardless of refrigerator brand) we are stuck paying outrageous prices...we have no options.  Before I bought this Samsung refrigerator,  I had a GE profile.  The GE filters removed many many more impurities than the Samsung filters...yet the price charged is as high.  I'm very upset about this."
"Had nothing but problems (mostly leaking) with the off brand, just going to stick with the Samsung brand filter."
"Better than resale price, but these things are still crazy expensive."
Love it it was a perfect fit
"The Samsung brand is probably the higher in price than others.  The main thing that scares me is water damage to my home which can be very expense to repair.  Of course any filter can leak, but if I have to have a filter I will go with Samsung’s OEM versus a third party.  My other concern is filter quality.For the average household the filter only has to be replaced every six months so the expense will not be a big deal for peace of mind.  Your mileage may vary depending on the water supply quality and amount of usage.New filter tip:  See photos 6 and 7. The instructions say to run five gallons of water through the filter before using the water.  To make this an easy job I connected a piece of garden hose to a funnel long enough to reach a bucket setting on the floor.  The bucket is three gallons capacity so it was a no brainer to run about 1-2/3 buckets full fast."
"My Samsung refrigerator strictly states to use only these Samsung refills for the water filter and I am sure happy that I listened. The water filter works perfectly and comes with instructions and stickers with a month on them for you to stick the corresponding sticker to the filter as a reminder to change the filter in 6 months. Very easy to remove filter and replace it. Very helpful and detailed instructions as well. After replacing the filter, I dumped out the first 3 gallons of water to pass through the filter, along with the first 3 ice trays it made per the instructions. Now when I get ice water from the fridge, it tastes amazing, is nice and cold, and best of all it is crystal clear! My last fridge I had placed a popular brand name filter in it and every time I used the ice water, you could see what looked like sediment floating around and almost cloudy near the ice cubes. Since I recently purchased this fridge and changed the filter though, I have not seen any cloudy water nor any sediment or particles. This filter truly does keep your water clean and clear and tasting great!"
"I know that several reviewers have received knock-offs, but based on performance and packaging, the filters I received are the real deal.  They came with authentication tags on the box and the filter, and they appear to be working as good as the one that came with my fridge.  I have tried various knock-off brands in the past, and, as expected, you get what you pay for - the less expensive filters don't remove as much, and leave our water tasting like iron.  So, I'm back to paying a premium, but these Samsung filters just do a better job of filtering our water, completely removing the iron taste and smell."
This was a replacement for the original refrigerator water filter. One must use the exact recommended filter for the device to work properly. Check your refrigerator manual for the proper code on the filter to accommodate your refrigerator. The filter is doing what it is intended to do. My appliance is a Samsung.
"As always, this WATER FilTER gives my Family Peace of Mind."
High prices
The filter you sent is too big I need a filter that is model DA 97–17376B as in boy
It operates as described
It worked perfectly and was faster and easier to replace than I was expecting.
"No dislikes, easy to find on Amazon, good value, easy to install.  Great product!"
Works best
"I was looking for the replacement filter for the refrigerator I bought 6 months ago and could not find the ""00020A"" I contacted Samsung customer service via chat and they told me I needed to order from their parts distributor and that I would need to call during regular weekly hours. I persisted by asking what model is compatible and was eventually told this was the compatible filter for my Samsung RF263TEABC French Door Refrigerator. Their website did not list this as the replacement for my model and I was told the website must not have been updated. No big deal. So they confirmed this is the replacement and I got it here, much cheaper and faster.+ Tastes Great+ Easy Direct Replacement+ Month Stickers to Place on New Filter as a Reminder (I put it on the knob)- Reduced water pressure quite a bit. The original pushed water out with much more force._Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this and I would also recommend contacting Samsung support if there are any questions regarding compatibility. This filter works great, the water tastes good, but the pressure is reduced (at least in my experience). 4 Stars for the drop in pressure."
Perfect fit for our fridge. What I would expect from OEM
ordered a 2 pack samsung water filter. Just received it and there was only one filter in the box.
"This is an expensive filter. The flavor is not as good as my PUR pitch filter.However, I do like to have a filtered ice drink in the Sumer. Thus, nothing to complain about."
"Been using these filters for years, seems to do the job.  No issues to report."
"The box was a little damaged it also looked like it had gotten wet at one point.  The product looked to be in original shrink wrap and appears to be new, but honestly there is no way to tell."
fits perfectly
"Perfect OEM replacement for the factory filter in my Samsung RF28HMEDBSR refrigerator, with a HAF-CIN/EXP cartridge and recommended replacement with DA29-00020B-1.This filter costs more than others, almost double, because it does more than others, much more than double.  It is a certified ANSI 53 filter which includes ANSI 42.[...]ANSI 42: Establishes the minimum requirements designed to reduce aesthetic or non-health-related contaminants, such as chlorine, taste, odor and particulates.  Products are certified only for material safety, pressure bearing and structural integrity, not for filtration capabilities.ANSI 53:  Establishes the minimum requirements for the certification of filtration systems designed to reduce specific health-related contaminants, such as Cryptosporidium, lead, volatile organic chemicals(VOC) and asbestos that may be present in public or private drinking water.  The reduction claims are verified by this standard.Basically, ANSI 42 may make your water taste better, but ANSI 53 is required to make your water safer to drink.  What is the purpose of filtration if it does not make the water safer to drink?"
"First time posting a review, but I felt this deserved one.I have a Samsung RF4287HARS french door fridge, for which this filter is supposed to be a suitable replacement.  Upon receiving the filter, I installed it per the instructions, and my fridge made a loud groaning noise.  This noise eventually stopped, but clearly was not normal. When trying to dispense water, I would get a little water at first, but it very quickly slowed to a trickle and then stopped.  The dreaded groaning noise would also come back on occasion while trying to dispense water.  Normal flow (with no filter) is 6 ounces in 10 seconds.  With this filter, I was lucky to get 2 ounces in the 30ish seconds it takes before the automatic kill switch kicks in.I've purchased this ""Samsung"" filter, as well as several generic brands, and all of them have acted in a similar fashion.  I finally broke down and spent the $50+ for a Samsung filter from a big box store.  In visually comparing the big box filter to the one purchased from Amazon, the differences are subtle, but numerous.- label on big box filter package says ""mineral water""...label on Amazon filter package says ""fresh water"".- center hole in tip of Amazon filter is tiny compared to the hole in tip of big box filter.- structural design of filter between the two o-rings in completely different between the two.I'm an engineer that has worked in product development for 15+ years, and in my opinion the ""genuine Samsung"" filter I purchased from Amazon is either a knockoff, or an older Samsung design that they have since revised/eliminated.  Keep in mind that neither the Amazon filter nor the new filter from the big box store look like my previous filter (which still works just fine), so clearly Samsung is doing design updates to these filters for some reason or another (my guess is cost reduction).Bottom line, buy this filter at your own risk.  It was completely useless in my fridge and it's being returned to Amazon for a refund.Update: After carefully inspecting the packaging for both filters, there are several differences.Amazon filter - Manufactured for Samsung Electronics by 3M Purification (Mexico), graphic on left side panel is misplaced and overruns text on the package, capacity listed as 1136L/300GBig box filter - Manufactured for Samsung Electronics by Microfilter Co., LTD (Korea), graphic appears properly centered, capacity listed as 1150L/300G.Both filters have the exact same EAN number and UPC code."

"UPDATE 10/18/2016: Okay folks, it has been confirmed that Samsung now redesigned their haf-cin / DA29-00020b filters. In the photos the one you see with Double rubber ring on the neck is the newest version.Pros:-Whoever had a leaking issue previously probably will no more have any leakage (even tho it wasn't the filters fault, it's your loose housing or wrong placement of filter).Cons:-now people who had no issues before may have issues now, not the leakage but your water flow will be extremely decreased-if you are switching from the older version filter with single rubber ring to the double rubber ring new design, you will have to shut off the water valve, otherwise little bit of air will shut your new filter and it will no more work. once air pressure goes into the filter, paper changes it forms kind of gets damaged i guess.-you will be so pissed due to double ring and change of design will decrease your water flow, so that means to take out the first 5 6 gallon of water will take hours!!!!Conclusion, SAMSUNG NEEDS A NEW FILTER COMPANY OR REPLACE OUR EXISTING REFRIGERATORS WITH NEW ONE FOR FREE BECAUSE YOU LIKE MESSING UP EVERY YEAR WITH YOUR FILTER DESIGN!!!!UPDATE 10/16/2016 ( I have been purchasing this same filter from Amazon, sold and shipped by) here is the latest one i just received 20 days ago and i was going to replace today, and just surprised that something was different!!!! Now there is a double rubber o-ring on the outer head of the filter??? Does Samsung making changes or what is going on??? I spent 2 hours to get a water flowing thru this filter, no luck. Not older filter doesn't work as well. I am afraid that this latest filter damaged my water filter housing head, I am returning for the replacement and will see if the replacement comes different or not.Latest filter september 2016 looks the one with double rubber ring on the head part.it looks little taller than what i have been using originally all the time (i always buy from amazon, shipped and sold)also the filter's top head neck bottom (where its the body starts) looks different as well. Samsung needs to clarify if there are any changes or not on the filter!!!Bought it at October 31st, it did fit, worked and served perfect. No leaks or other issues. Water runs fast and filters very well. I did some water tests between water coming thru this filter and coming straight from the tap. Filters and also softens the water little bit as well. Ensure the model type of filter in your refrigerator matches with this Da29-00020b as well so you will not have leaks or any other problems. 6 months of use 2 people, having visitors oftenly and we are really water drinkers. Just the filter light turned little bit purple now. So 6 months of life for a filter is actually pretty good."
"Despite the bad reviews from some people.  I was able to look at the previous pictures from other people and was able to match with filter at home.  I have no issues, and no leaks. The double plastic ring is better for protection against leaks. This one comes with those.  Also after 2 full jars of water, the water came out clear, and taste is normal.  Also, some people mentioned the Logo on the box or the filter, this is something about the age of the filter you have at home. Mine was different but, it is original. So, zero worries.  If you have any issues, is probably, human error."
Perfect filter and good taste of water easy to install 👍
I took a chance because it is so difficult to find exact filter for a Samsung fridge when it becomes 9 years old.This worked perfectly. Now I have a replacement after this one for only a few pennies more.
Have ordered cheaper off brand filters before and the water stream was horribly slow.  Go with the brand for your fridge.
"These are the real deal not some cheap knock-off. This filter meets NSF/ANSI Standards 42 and 53.  Many of the filters you see on Amazon and elsewhere only meet Standard 42. There is a huge difference between the two standards.NSF/ANSI Standard 42:The commonly tested chemical reduction claims for products seeking certification to NSF/ANSI Standard 42 are: chlorine (taste and odor), chloramines, iron, manganese, hydrogen sulfide, pH neutralization and zinc reduction.NSF/ANSI Standard 53:The commonly tested chemical reduction claims for products seeking certification to NSF/ANSI Standard 53 are: heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury and selenium), inorganics (fluoride and nitrate plus nitrite) and volatile organic chemicals (chloroform surrogate as well as individual organic chemicals).Also many unscrupulous vendors will claim that the filters meet both 42 and 53, then ship the unknowing consumer a filter that only meets standard 42.  This is not the case here.  These are the real deal. If you should decide to buy another type of filter, please check the package when it arrives and make sure it clearly states they are NSF/ANSI Standard 42 and 53 approved"

"Sure, I wish these OEM filters from Samsung cost a little less.  But they work as advertised, and I trust them.  The one non-OEM filter I tried (
ReplacementBrand Samsung DA29-00020B Comparable Refrigerator Water Filter
) would not even fit into the nozzle of the Samsung refrigerator correctly, and I had to throw it out.One other thing - multiple reviews of third party filters will mention how they love that the ""water flow is so much better than with the Samsung filter.""  To my mind that means either (1) they are comparing a brand new third party filter to a used Samsung filter, OR (2) the third party filter is doing a substandard job of filtering the water.  I would also note that the Samsung OEM filter is NSF 53 certified, while none of the third party filters I've looked at have this certification (most have no certification at all, and one I found was ""independently certified at NSF 42"" but has no NSF emblem on it).In this case I believe that a genuine filter from Samsung is worth the extra cost."
To take out impurities was the reason to use this product
"I chose the name brand filter because if I use a generic then my warranty if needed could  be void. The name brand is  15 to 20 dollars more. If your refrigerator is not under warranty, save yourself a few bucks and buy the generic. The filter was easy to install. 10 seconds and done!"
Fit my Samsung  3 door refrigerator.
Excellent product
"I don't know if everyone realizes that Samsung announced building a manufacturing facility in Mexico in 2003.  So, I don't see how it being assembled in Mexico makes the filter fake.  I also purchased the same filter from one of the authorized sellers of Samsung parts listed on their corporate website and yep, it is also labeled on the filter that is assembled in Mexico with parts sourced from around the world. I installed one of the replacements that I bought through Amazon, and no leaks along with no fitment problems whatsoever.  The NSF 42 and 53 standards that this filter meets is on the product label described as being tested by an independent laboratory, and not the folks that make this certification/standard.  This is by no means a knock on the product, but just a differentiation to keep in mind.  The quality of the water produced by this filter is excellent, and I did run a gallon through the water dispenser to get the air out of the line after installing the new/non-water filled filter. This is a bargain price for a legitimate product. Thanks Amazon!!"
"These filters have an indeterminate lifespan in fridges which don't have water dispensers.  It's hard to tell whether the quality is really changing when you are only getting ice, so I just blindly follow the six-month warning light.  Working out the price, I may even save money if I buy bags of ice and dump them into the dispenser, but it's hard to beat the convenience, and that's what we're really funding here.Blessedly, there are only two types of filters in Samsung fridges (at least as far as I can tell from their website) so if you have the long-skinny tube, this one is for you.  The quality of the filters really seems to be good in comparison to something mainstream (and terribly over-rated) like Britta.Amazon is currently not selling these in-house, so I got mine from a third-party seller with free shipping.  It took a couple of weeks to get to me, but it is a genuine Samsung product as advertised.  Apparently, this was a big issue for a while."
"I tryed cheaper version by amazon basic, they look the same fit the same and flow was the same, but the taste is completely different. I went back to Samsung original which is expensive, $50 from time to time you can find discount like $35-$40 but the water taste good, not like cheaper versions"
"It was the same brand that I brought, but lower price. Where I brought the refrigerator from the filter cost more. I like the price that I paid and it works the same as the higher price"
worked as expected
"Getting filtered water is something that most people want to drink over water form the tap.  Rather than go out and spend money each day on bottled water or a water filtration  machine, simply purchase this water filter from Samsung.  You will not need to replace it every six months as recommended, but can squeeze a few more months time out of this filter.  When you bought the fridge it came with this feature of dispensing filtering water.  Drinking your suggested daily 8 cups of filtered water each will certainly be more cost effective than going out and purchasing 8 bottles of bottled water each day.  True the initial outlay of cash for the product may make you shake your head, but it breaks down to less than buying a case of filtered water every few days for six months to 8 months.  Some people drink even more water than that. It is great if you want filtered water for cooking too."
"I just installed my first filter on our new fridge.  It was easy to twist to the unlock position, but impossible to pull out by hand.  A 12 inch pair of channel lock pliers with a firm tug popped it right out!  After turning the water supply back on, I drained out about a gallon of water (vs the 6-7 gallons the owners manual recommended) and the water was perfectly clear!These are good filters!  I checked mine a half hour after installation and no leaks!!!  :-)I gave it 4 stars, since I had to use a tool to pull it out of the fridge.  (I think the engineers could put some knurls on the gripping part to make it possible to pull it out by hand.)  The first one lasted 6 months before the red filter light came on.  I suspect we could have used the old filter a few more months, since most of the time it's only my wife and I using the filter."
Easy to install! And genuine product! I followed directions on the box to install and let the water flow through the filter for 3 gallons of water and empty before I reset the filter button. First gallon of water contained couple of white paper like material and chlorine like smell and little bit of yucky water... but I didn't expect the filter to work right away...samething with facet filters you have to let the water run through the filter for couple gallons before it starts to work right and remove all the contaminations. I read a lots of reviews before purchasing this product and its authentic product! Make your own judgement on what people post as review and also learn to follow instructions (you know there are pieces of paper that comes with every product? That looks like a booklet? Yea! That one!) on how to use the product right way.
What can I say........ It was what a wanted.  Its a filter
These are OEM filters for Samsung refrigerators.  They are the only ones I have been able to find for my model that remove lead from the water.  Each one lasts 6 months and they are easy to remove and install.  My wife is very attune to water taste and uses only the water dispensed by our frige for drinking and cooking.  Watch for good deals since the price seems to fluctuate quite a bit over time.
"It's true wheen they say you pay for what you get. When my filter went out I purchased a cheaper one that was not Samsung. That was the worst mistake I ever made. The taste was different, it didn't last as long and removing it was not an easy task. I replaced it with the Samsung and could immediately tell the difference. From now on... I will stick with Samsung. It's a little more but as I said before, you get what you pay for."
"I purchased 4 single/individual Samsung Replacement Cartridges (Model # DA29-00020B) from Filter King for our Samsung French Door refrigerator recently.  The single filters were strangely cheaper than buying a multipack of 3 - that should have been a red flag for what's to come!  I have purchased from other companies thru Amazon.com usually in a 3pack, and have not had problems.  All 4 new filters purchased from Filter King thru Amazon.com did NOT work - loud vibrations, and product did not align at the right angle!!  I opened the box for the first filter and noticed that there were no instructions or monthly date code stickers contained within - odd, but the cartridge filter was shrinkwrapped new.  I followed the instructions for installation of the filter as I had done in the past at least a half dozen times without issue on our Samsung refrigerator.  Immediately noticed that the arrow on the filter did not perfectly align at 12:00, as they did on the filter just de-installed – alignment was off by perhaps 1/8th of inch, I'd say it was stuck at 11:57 - I didn't want to overtorque it and break something inside the refrigerator.  Turned the water on to the fridge and began the process to flush water through the system as instructed.  No water came out and very audible vibrations could be heard.  Turned the water to the fridge off again and de-installed this filter and tried a second new one – this one was also shrinkwrapped, and unlike the first did contain the instructions & stickers.  However, the same misalignment was seen in the 2nd cartridge filter, stuck at 11:57 (not fully vertically aligned) and the same result was obtained  - No Water through the system and Audible Rattling.  Decided to reinstall the old filter that we were trying to replace and found it to lock in place just fine (arrows correctly aligned at 12:00) and saw that water properly flowed through the system.  De-installed this filter and closely compared it the two “new” ones  paying close attention to the “open” end – the end which engages the water nozzle inside the fridge.  The old (working) filter was shown to have the center circular piece on the open end to be flush with the rest of the nozzle end, meaning they were the same length.  This was in contrast to the other two new (non-working) filters in which the center circular piece was not flush – rather it was depressed in by ~1/16th of an inch.  It looks like I got a whole batch which were manufactured defectively and missed Quality Control standards.  Decided to open the last 2 “new” filters and found them to be in the same state as the other 2 non-working filters (would not lock in place in the fridge and the center circular piece was not flush with the rest of the nozzle end).  I believe all 4 of the “new” filters are defective – they all seem to have the same serial code 'A2442' – suggesting that they could have come from the same bad manufacturing lot.  If the price is too good to be true, it's likely a rip off!!  These 4 filter rejects are all going back to amazon.com and I am buying elsewhere from a brick and mortar, big name place."
Very easy to install and get peace of mind about the quality of water you and your family are consuming easy the pain of the cost
Great prices cheaper than big box store.
Spend the extra money to get a safe water filter directly from Samsung. I find it to be worth it since its water that we drink!
"I've been buying one of these filters every six months for the past two years to replace the factory filter that come with our samsung french door refrigerator. The water tastes great, they seem to do a good job filtering chlorine since our tap water smells strongly of. We have a big family and we use the filtered water for both drinking as well as cooking. The filter lasts about five months before it starts to slow the flow of water. It's usable another 1-2 months past that but it will take a long time to fill a tea kettle or water bottle although the water will still taste good. I find the purple to red light indicator on the door of the fridge is pretty spot on with when it needs to be replaced. I like to order a new one when it goes to purple but wait to switch it out until the light turns red."
Good purchase for my fridge
Nothing
"Fit easy - Install Easy Came QuickWARNING buy in single packs... Doubles cost more than two singles.  The company may not understand bulk packaging and reduced prices... It must cost them more to send one at a time -- but we save because they have not figured that out yet.  I ordered two because the search was confusing before I bought -- so I didn't want to do this again in 6-12 months.FYI recommend changing every six months or 300 gallons.  NOTE you can stretch this.. but if you find them DIFFICULT to remove, that means you are getting calcium or lime build up at the connection (Mineral build up) and this means at one point the replacement may not fit properly due to build up.  So be careful about penny wise dollar foolish.  ALSO, after you install the directions say run for six minute (Apx 1 gal) NO WAY... they just want you to clear the line and air bubbles -- stand back after you hook up and push button... first two pumps will burst out with air -- after about 2 glasses -- you are all good."
Great price for a name brand product
Used these on Samsung Refrigerators for many years.  Only ever had one issue with these filters.  The end piece cracked and broke when I was removing one.  It was easily resolved with needle nose pliers.  I routinely change them after the specified time.  I suspect they would last longer since there are only two of us and we don't use as much water.
It was. Exactly what I ordered
"The packaging is different from the one I bought in the store, but it does not affect the use."
Love having filtered ice and water
"I can only buy this brand for my fridge, wish it could be a little cheaper."
Good price for this filter—cheaper than in a store.
This product was the perfect replacement for my existing filter. I also appreciate the subscribe & safe feature which will ensure I receive and replace filters during the prescribed iterations.  It was simple to unpackage and install.
"This is not a real Samsung filter, which explains it being about half the price of others, but it lacks the authentication tag. It seems to work okay after running some water through it, but it behaved like cheaper filters I have purchased in the past that ended up causing damage to my refrigerator. I will be contacting Amazon and canceling my subscribe and save."
"This is a great and easy way to change a frig water filter.  My new Samsung French door frig seems to want  to have the filter  changed ever y six months , not based on the amount of water I use.  That's OK...I value safe and great tasting water and ice.  In my first order for a filter I received  a sticker for the month that the filter was to be changed.  In the current order that sticker did not ship.  I guess I will just wait for the light to come on to change the filter. The little red light came on 6 months to the day from the last change.  Placing an order with Amazon make the filter show up FAST!This is so much easier than the old frig where I had to wrestle with the filter at  the back of inside of the frig."
Normal
"As some others have said in their reviews, I too have an older model fridge that can’t handle the redesign of this filter. The filter fits in correctly but the flow of water is little to none. If I take the filter out, everything is fine. I put the filter in and  it works fine for a day or two and then slows to nothing. I have tried replacing the filter several times just in case it was a faulty filter but the same thing happens each time. There are no leaks in the lines. Very disappointing that this redesign was not tested on older model fridges (and by older model I mean 7 years)."
Never had a problem. off brands I do.
Getting the Samsung brand as the fridge for the price compared with other place is great easy to install just follow instructions because you have to close water supply to fridge before you remove the older one and install new one water taste good I can’t complain I did it my self always look for instructional videos (recommended)
"Works well, but almost double the cost of off-brand replacement filters."
"OEM filters are the best in my opinion,  expensive but worth every penny. We live in a hard water areas which contains a lot of chlorine, terrible taste and smell from the tap. This filter removes this and makes the water taste as water should taste!"
I was surprised to receive it so quickly and it was installed in less than a minute
I bought two.  The first one I tried didn't work and caused damage to the refrigerator and a big expense.  The other filter is fine.  I can't find any kind of warranty - yet this is the only filter that I am supposed to use in my refrigerator.  This is too expensive to not have a warranty.
I learned my lesson generic filters don't already fit appropriately so I buy the Samsung factory made filters for my Samsung refrigerator. I can purchase these filters at Amazon for about 15 to 20 dollars less than at a local store. Buying generic filters sometimes cause the line to leak.
"After purchasing a Samsung refrigerator two and a half years ago, I've consistently purchased these replacement filters about every 6 months. I was hesitant to purchase these initially, as I wasn't sure of the quality of the filtration and the fit for my refrigerator. After trying two other filter brands (both generic filters purchased online), these filters are hands down the best. Unlike the other brands that I tried, the water from these tastes great and I haven't noticed any decrease in water flow from the factory included filter. These also were noticeably heavier than the generic brands, which I'm guessing means more filtration in the filter.A few notes:1. Prices on these can fluctuate.  As of this review they're $6 cheaper than they were in April, the last time I purchased. If you see them at a reasonable price, stock up on a few to save money down the line.2. Always check the prices for the single, double and triple packs.  Ordering multiple singles can be cheaper than the double or triple packs."
The filter fits perfectly and performs as expected.
Very easy to install and water tastes great.
"Giving it only four stars because it has only been in use for two days.  Not exactly the same label as the previous ones that I have purchased but much less money and it does have a Samsung label.  I actually had a couple leaks with the original new ones I bought at the more expensive price but not because the filter was bad but because it didn't seat properly.  Had to take it out and put it back in a couple times before it didn't leak.  This one went right in with no problems.  Seems to do the job and saved me a lot of money.I am now on my second filter and would give these five stars.  Work as good or better than the store bought.  Check around Amazon for pricing though because it is different depending where you order them.  As long as the box says Samsung, I am good with them."
"Amazing!! I have a Samsung RS265TDRS refrigerator. As soon as the Samsung filter (that the fridge came with) needed to be replaced I bought the Water Sentinel brand. It's generic, so the price attracted me...what can I say, I'm a cheapskate! :) As 2 years went by, my husband and I became increasingly frustrated with our fridge. The water pressure on the door was pathetic to say the least. We had running jokes about the time it took to fill a simple glass of water. This time I looked at buying the Samsung filter not even thinking it would improve my water pressure issue. I did because I found out that the Water Sentinel brand actually filters out less particles compared to the Samsung filter. Well I paid the extra cash and to my amazement, my water pressure issue is completely gone! And my water, which is extremely hard in my town, actually tastes better too!! I'm so glad I spent the extra cash and bought name-brand! These filters are worth EVERY penny!"
Value for money
mahalo
"TLDR: Believe the bad reviews. It’s 100% fake and will probably cost you more than just grief.Gave benefit of the doubt despite warning reviews since I’ve ordered from this exact post over a year ago. The moment package is opened you can tell it’s a fake… poor printing, poor manufacturing (cuts were rough and still had some shavings), no authenticity label… I STILL decided to trust and install it.Tested the water after running close to 10 gallons of water through and TDS meter read about 40 points higher than unfiltered tap. That’s fine… we had a zero water filter to use until it settles but it never dropped.One day later we had our first leak. We cleaned and reinserted then checked for more drips but seemed fine. Two days later, came home to a massive amount of water inside and under the fridge.It’s in the trash now and here I am… Don’t bother even trying. Do yourself a favor and hard pass on this garbage. Get a real replacement at your local hardware or appliance store."
I replaced a prior purchase of the same item
This is a great deal for two! The filters are dependable and I’ve been using them since buying my fantastic frig 5 years ago. The water is nice and cold and delicious! I enjoy it better than bottled water and I recycle empty bottles which I refill with my filtered water.
oem replacement
"We have owned our Samsung RF263BEAESR since 2012 and have replaced the filter every 6 months. From experience, we know all about the issues with airlocks and also how to clear them when installing a new filter. a few years ago we switched over to Aquacrest filters, although they flow a bit slower, they work fine.We thought we'd give genuine Samsung filters another try, mainly to see if we could have a faster flow again. BTW, the water flow without any filter is spectacular, so we know it wasn't a line issue.I made sure our model number is listed on this filter's product page before ordering (using the brand and model selection) and also by using the browser in page search to be sure.For this new Samsung filter, I checked they were authentic using the magnet and filter tag and duly installed  it. The water valve in the filter housing definitely opened, I could hear and feel a mild spurt of water trying to fill the filter. Then I tried to run 2-3 gallons through the filter using the door water dispenser. The briefest of spurts and air, then nothing. 2 minutes later with the dispenser running, still nothing. Tried reinstalling, same. Tried reinstalling 10 more times, still nothing more than the slowest stream of water. This filter never fills, only about an ounce or two of water.Decided to install a new Aquacrest filter to compare. Instant air purge from the dispenser, good flow, albeit slower than the earlier Samsung filters, but acceptable. Therefore I'm returning these new Samsung filters as defective."
It filters the water in my fridge. and the price is way lower than any store i've come across. I use it mainly to keep the filter life light on my fridge door from being red.
"Ordered these for a couple of years for my Samsung fridge. As a filter, they're just ok. I'm comparing the water output to the water output from my PUR pitcher, and the PUR pitcher water tastes my cleaner than this. I'm not sure why, but this doesn't seem to do much filtering. The water in our area is hard, and the water output from the fridge isn't too far from the tap.As if that alone, wasn't enough, the price on these is high. $49 for a filter isn't bad for 6 months, right? True, but here's the deal...they aren't always $49. I put this item on Subscribe & Save for every 6 months. Suspiciously, the item will fluctuate between $28 and $45 for most of the month, and then when Subscribe & Save time comes around? Boom. $49. I checked the day after it shipped, and guess what? $29. So the item apparently went back up to $49 - the highest price it's been all month - just long enough for the Subscribe & Save orders to be placed? I'm calling bull.It sounds to me like Amazon's computers know when these fluctuations are most benifiicial to Amazon. Maybe counting on Subscribe & Save customers not to check the price of these items during the month and only be happy that the item price is the same as the previous month or order date. I got on the phone with Amazon to bring it to their attention. God bless the guy who got my call, because he wasn't the culprit here, but he caught all of my wrath that day. A $20 price fluctuation just around S&S time? No way, not happening. They refunded me the difference between what I paid and what I would have paid if the price had stayed the same. For that reason I'm giving them a 2/5.2 stars deducted because they aren't that great of a filter to begin with.1 star deducted because Amazon's Subscribe & Save practice are looking fishy.For both of those reasons, I'm trying an off brand filter that I've seen recommend for Samsung fridges. It's gotten rave reviews so far, and you get 2 filters for less than the lowest price that 1 Samsung brand filter sells for (currently at $29). Maybe those will work out better."
"This samsung filter works well, installs easily, and lives up to its 6 months of usage claim. I am happier with this than off brand versions"
"Amazon wants to know how I would rate the flavor of this product. To be honest I did not put it in my mouth, I'm not sure why I would, but I can image it would be a 1 star taste if I had.Seriously though, it's exactly what it's supposed to be. Took the old one out and just put the new one in. Works, done."
Cheaper than local storesWorks fine
"What an easy way to replace your fridge filters! I used to take a picture of the manufacturer's replacement filters but now I order from Amazon. These were the exact match from Samsung, they are now in my account, so I can always get the replacements w/o finding the information then running around town. There is also an option for regular on-time shipments!"
"The Samsung water filters are a perfect fit for our fridge, and appear to work properly."
Arrived NIBEasy to install
Great replacement for original Samsung water filter
"This is the exact water filter recommended by Samsung for our new refrigerator. I was very tempted to try some of the after market water filters but decided, given the varied ratings of those filters, that I would just stick with Samsung's recommendation.  I weighed the price of these filters (yes, they are more expensive) to what I would save on getting after market filters and decided it just wasn't worth the risk. We paid too much for this refrigerator to try to save a few dollars every year, especially if there is the potential that the after market filters could cause problems. I did save a few dollars by getting three at the same time, but still not as much as I would have saved had I gone with the cheaper knock offs. But now I don't have to worry about anything happening as a result of using a discounted water filter."
"this is so easy to install as a replacement for an old filter.  Just turn off the main water supply, drain the water from the line for a few minutes, and you're all ready to go.  Just a quick turn of a knob, pull out the old one, and then insert the new one."
Filters perfctly
"Cheaper and yet just as effective than big box store filters. Easy to install, don’t notice any other differences."
"The only filters for my Samsung fridge. We have several in our house and the generic / clone filters either leak or don't taste as good. But be very careful. We have had ""Samsung"" brand filters come from some Amazon vendors that were NOT Samsung or were obvious nock-offs. Amazon replaced them without an issue. Look at the vendors, read the descriptions and reviews carefully. Ours last about 6 months and we feel they're worth the extra few dollars."
"The filter is necessary but pretty expensive for as often as it seems to need replacing. A little more effort required to install than I wish, feels maybe like it is spring-loaded in the fridge. If you don't do it correctly, it will create a leak all over the bottom of the fridge. Still, the water does taste clean and fresh, which is the goal."
"I highly recommend these. I have not tried the generic brands, but this work just as good as the original. I’ve had my fridge for about nine months and it is exactly like how it did when I first got it. I didn’t realize that I was basically drinking tap water until I switched the filters and it definitely made a difference"
"This is a revised review on re-ordering this from Amazon to replace the earlier one. THIS FILTER IS NOW DIFFERENT:This new replacement filter is visually different. It is no longer made in Korea, but says made in Mexico by 3M. If I do an online search on this, the results are not good. In fact there was litigation by State Farm Insurance on a filter that leaked in a home from a Samsung refrigerator from by a OEM replacement Samsung labeled filter made by 3M from what seems to be this same plant.My problem is that this seems bait and switch. Suddenly this is a different filter. First thing you notice is that the label no longer has a serialized production number on it like the one from Korea. The label even was of less quality, thinner and was bubbled. You also notice that the filter itself has little nubs and shaved on the plastic outside housing that reveal a less than the same product finishing. If you peer down the hole, this new 3M labeled Samsung filter has a different sub-opening, it has a smaller plastic ""gate"" inside.So I paid pretty much the same as last time here on Amazon, but received a different filter in actuality. They are making more money on better margins from me for this filter, but selling me a lesser built filter. I do not like that. Now I hope this doesn't leak, but it certainly from my research is at a higher risk of doing so. Moreover, I am not more concerned it can actually say as it says it can do as a filter and it's NSF rating. With this diminished quality on the outside, one has to wonder what corners were cut inside. DISAPPOINTING!-----------------------------------Old Review Below-----------------First time replacement on new refrigerator. Not sure what more I can add to what is a basic item; it either functions or it doesn't. However I will say that the order came in exactly as expected, shrink wrapped Samsung OEM replacement, exactly as the one installed. No problem installing. The only observation I can have is that the output is slightly less pressure than before. So no changes on my end except replacing the one that came with the fridge from the factory and this one, yet there is slightly less of a flow rate of water now. I see some people are seeing that too on these reviews, so I echo it. It's not a drastic drop, but it is a slight drop, which I hate to see from anything all brand new."
"We reorder these every six months. Best prices, clean and tasty water. Make sure you prime the filters by running a gallon or two of water through to remove any carbon filter residue before you drink it or make ice cubes with water run through the new filter. It won't hurt you, but grey ice looks nasty!"
"I've tried a couple of off-brand filters, neither of which sealed properly and were not usable. Had to resort to the manufacturer version. It works fine. It's just a much higher price than I'd expect for what it does. And if you replace it every six months like the manufacturer ""suggests"" you'll spend over $100 / year just on filters."
"I notice a difference with my water and more importantly my coffee when the filter is in need of replacement. Arrived early, easy installation and after a few gallons of water to rinse out the dust (my plants certainty don't mind a little carbon in their water) and I'm good to go for another 6 months! Thanks!"
"It removed chlorine taste from city bater, but it's only rated for 300 gallons?  At that rate I'll go through at least at least 6 to 8 per year, so $250-300 year just for filters.  After 10 years, I've paid more for water filters than the cost of the entire fridge.  Made in S. Korea and incorporates a special tag to verify it is an Authentic Samsung filter. For the price, you don't get many gallons of water out of it.I have city water that doesn't have much chlorine in it (they use Ozone to sanitize).  Comparing tap water to filtered fridge water, I can taste the difference."
Works good
"I have purchased before, I haven't used these yet but will in about 4-5 months."
Works well easy to install.
"Same filter you can buy in the local big box store (both Lowes and now, Home Depot carry it) but at a decent savings. Does exactly what it needs to do and does it for about 6 months so it's nice to only be replacing this twice a year.If at all possible, do precisely what the instructions say -- turn off the water supply before replacing the filter. You can swap filters without doing so but, in my experience, the water system in our Samsung fridge has been its achilles heel. These filters are a bear to get locked properly in their housings compared to other filters on other refrigerators I've had. But if you've got one of the high-end Samsung fridges, you've got to have it so this is as good a place as any to get it.Nice to be able to save a few bucks by planning ahead a little and not having to run down to the local store!"
Right part at the right time
"A lot has been said about this filter. I've ordered twice from Amazon. Both times the filter is identical to the one the fridge came with. They are both NSF ANSI. The first time I followed the directions exactly. This time I didn't turn off the water. There were no leeks. Put the filter in, push and turn it 180 degrees to line up the arrows. There was a hiss as the filter filled quickly. Done no leaks. Ran several pitchers through. No leaks. I'll check a couple more times later but I'm probably good.  This is a OEM Samsung part that has instructions in the box.  It took 9 months before the change filter light came on. Hope this helps."
"I bought a 3 pack of Pureline replacement filters for my Samsung side by side a year ago for about the same price as this one original Samsung filter.  I thought I was a pretty smart shopper when the first 2 worked fine and lasted the full 6 months.  I realized maybe I wasn't as smart as I thought when the 3rd Pureline leaked all over my fridge and kitchen.  I understand that even with one dud I got 12 months of filtering with Pureline for the price of 6 months of Samsung filtering but God only knows how effective these cheap Chinese knock offs were at filtering.  Needless to say I bought the original Samsung and it works like a champ, never again with the Chinese knock-offs for me."
easy to install
"Amazon, I think I’m onto you and your suppliers! These filters were delivered a full 10 days or so before promised. We had almost gone out to buy one at full retail, planning to hold these in reserve for next time. Sure glad we didn’t spend that extra money!"
Nothing to dislike..exactly what I ordered
It is easy to install
"I’ve had this product on this subscription for the last couple of years, and it’s always arrived on time with a perfect fit. My refrigerator is getting a little bit older, and this is a very handy option to have the unit delivered every six months."
"Not sure what to say except they fit and appear to be working as directed.  To me water (city water) doesn't have a flavor.  Where I grew up the water definitely had a flavor, wonderful...mostly clean.  Pulled the old one out and put in the new one...very easy.  I don't know how much other water filters cost but I got the 3 pack and saved about $20 over ordering them individually."
Highly recommend.
The filter has been installed over a month and no leaks yet.
Works well and is that same product sold at Home Depot but for less.
"I finally replaced my original filter in my Samsung fridge with this one. Very simple replacement and no leaks or issues, and no need to turn off the water. Simply remove the old one and insert the new one. I have since learned that you can just remove the filter and operate the fridge without it, as long as your water quality doesn't require the filter(our water quality is good). I also bought different no name filters as these Samsung ones are quite expensive, but was worried because of the reviews that mentioned leaks, so have not yet tried these. I would recommend the filter but have deducted one star for price, as these should not be that expensive to produce. ."
"Did web search for filters and saw several models claiming to be original replacement Filters. Made the mistake and bought one at a website called Samsung Outlet. Turns out that was not the real Samsung. Ice stopped coming, Cold water Stopped. It took some search to find the right filter. Once installed, ice and water started working."
"I bought a two pack. The first filter worked fine, it did what it was supposed to do, but the second filter stopped working. After every few uses it stopped dispensing water, and I had to take it out and put it back in for it to work again. It got to the point of having to take it out several times a day which is was a huge PITA. I would have expected this from a knock off, but not from a genuine product. Needless to say, this filter was tossed and replaced with a knock off for half the price and it's working much better now."
What can I say.? It is the correct part number to fit our samsung refrigerator. Easy install.
"Works as it should. Authentic product from Samsung store at Amazon. Bought off brand once, failed in the middle of the night, work up to several inches of water on kitchen floor. Now I only buy the authentic Samsung filter."
I love the name brand filters and the prices tend to be high but you know what you're getting and you know you're investing on a better return in product.  I want my family to have the best possible water and I don't want to buy off brands hoping they're just as good as the ad promises.  I usually find these hugely discounted on Amazon regularly so keep an eye out.  I love these and will continue to purchase these for my refridgerator.
"Update: September 8, 2019 - I just repurchased another 2 pack; however, the labeling on the actual product is not like my first purchase.  The information on the box is.  The box says it has a charcoal filter, and this was also labeled on the actual filter; however, on the new ones I just purchased, it is not.  So, I’m hoping I received the same product.  It went into the refrigerator nicely with no problems, so I’m hoping all is good. I did not test it to see if you actually get Alkaline water 💦 with this one.Gives you alkaline water right from your fridge!  I really like these.  I would definitely recommend them and will be repurchasing."
"Very clear, flavor is amazing and it's very easy to install...I am a happy customer."
fits good in refrigerator
"At first, it puzzled me as the one I was replacing had on one O-ring at the top, while this one had two O-rings at the top. Also, the locking dial was skinnier. I actually went an ask for a return and refund. But after thinking about it for a moment, and comparing the two, I concluded that it ought to fit even with 2 O-rings because the length and shape of the filters were a pretty close to a twin match. So I gave it a try. It slid in easily, and locked down effortlessly, quickly, and securely.  I am impressed and very happy, I quickly canceled the return and refund. And apologize for my earlier misjudgment. It's a great product, and it works beautifully. Thank you.Starjet"
Pay the extra money for this filter all the knock offs don't even come close to this filter I know because I tried a lot of different ones that were cheaper & they all sucked you pay what you get that is for sure
Bought product previously. Worked great then. Always my go to now. Good reputation.
"It is so easy to install this water filter in our Samsung refrigerator. Just twist our]t the old one and insert and twist the new one. Run water through it for five minutes, and you're all set for another five or six months."
"My wife wasn't drinking water from our fridge because ""it had a flavor"". Well I didn't really know what to do, it was the first time I had a home with a water serve fridge. Did my google research and the filter was the key. Very easy to install (if you follow the steps of course) and now my wife cannot stop drinking water from our fridge. Highly recommend this filter."
"There is not much to say in this review; Samsung recommends this filter as a replacement for my refrigerator, so I keep buying it whenever the time comes around to replace the filter. I have bought these several times already and have never encountered an issue. The water always tests well and the filters are easy to install.I haven't had any issues about the filter being redesigned, as other reviewers have mentioned. I think they might have gotten bad or defective units. Mine works (and acts) just like the ones before it.As other reviewers have stated, you do not have to religiously change it every six months. I test my water once a month and have found that mine needs changing once every 12-15 months, and even then could probably last for longer if I'm too busy or forget to order a replacement."
"I like subscribing to receive the needed filter for our refrigerator as it comes when it's supposed to and saves us a bit of money too.  When our kitchen was being remodeled and our refrigerator unplugged, I was able to push back the regular delivery of the filter.  It's easy to install too."
"Great name brand replacement for the Samsung fridge. Easy to swap! Tip: use a large cup when using the water for the first time after, it likes to spray water and air when you are priming the filter for the first time."
Works great
"I really like to use these, my only real complaint is they are kind of difficult to remove and the water tastes a little funny at first.  That's after flushing the 5 gallons of water through the system before use."
Frig filter
"The Samsung Da29-00020b Refrigerator Water Filter was just as it said it would be.  If only Samsung had made its' refrigerator easier to put this water filter in to!  (You must turn off the water supply behind the fridge before replacing the filter.) The only reason I did not give this filter a five star rating, is that somehow it just seems to be a rip-off that a filter can't be made to last longer than six months.  We are such a throw-away society and those manufacturers want us to have to continually purchase a product, instead of making something to last a decent amount of time. BUT, the filter will last the six (6) months as promised. An overall good buy."
The 2 pack was a good price and easy to install.
"I have a Samsung branded refrigerator. I normally tend to buy the 3rd party vendor brands when it comes to replacing the filters as they are inexpensive and I have yet to notice a true difference if any in the water quality. I decided I would again buy an OEM replacement to test my theory again and compare. Below are my results:Pros:1. OEM PartCons:1. Hard to put in, even with the water turned off.2. Complete loss of water pressure/barely any water coming out of the dispenser3. Leaked slightly even when properly installed.4. Had to go online to troubleshoot installNow I might have gotten a defective unit,but even so I would expect some sort of quality control so that this wouldn't have to be the experience I had.Would I recommend this filter?  No, 3rd party vendors provide a similar product for less money and the difference is not that noticeable.Why did I rate this 3 stars as opposed to 1? Well, had I bought more than just one I would of, but this was my first time buying this OEM filter.Would I buy this filter again? I probably will to see if my experience is better, but not for another 6 months!"
This goes in and out of the refrigerator easily.  Ive purchased a couple other off brands and always had trouble.  Even though the Samsung brand is more expensive kta definitely worth it not having to deal with not being able to get the filter out because I bought an off brand.
"Not sure what to say about this.  I think it filters my water but how do we really know?  I mean water is water right?  It tastes fine and I feel super hydrated after drinking it, but the question is does the filter make it better?  That is a question I can not answer but I can say the product showed up and looked like the picture and we all know that is something special.  Easy to install but jeez I needed to throw away about 3 gallons to get the ""chemicals""  out or something.  My arm is still sore from that.  They should offer to send someone out and do that for me and then it would be a 6 star yes a 6 star!!!!"
"The first one I ordered never arrived even though the USPS confirmed the delivery.  Amazon was terrific and had another sent to me with their own courier.  I suggest to Amazon to stop using USPS.  They are completely unreliable.  As for the filter, it's NSA 53 which means it filters out a lot more bad stuff than the NSA 43, so it's a little more expensive, but darn well worth it.  I do suggest buying the name brand.  The generics don't work as well and sometimes even leak.  Plus they don't filter was well.  Don't cheap out when it comes to your water quality - especially if you have children."
"THE WATER DOES NOT TASTE GREAT , THE ICE IS CLOUDY AND THE WORST PART IS I HAVE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY THINKING THE WATER IS AFE TO DRINK AND I DON'T THINK IT IS!!!WATCH OUT WITH SAMSUNG I DO NOT TRUST A COMPANY THAT HAS IT'S HANDS IN TOO MANY MASSES. P.S. THE REFRIGERATORS SUCK!!! POOR DESIGN AND UTILITY!!!"
The filter is easy to change and keeps water nice.
"Great tasting water with this filter!You pay more than you would pay for other aftermarket filters, but is worth it when it comes to your health! Don't forget to flush about 3 gallons of water at the initial install. I flush about a 1 1/2 gallons and started to get fresh tasting water after that!"
"I compared the price and this is the best one I could find. I received it in 2 days. Easy to replace the old filter. After filtering 2 gallons of water (of which I used to water my indoor plants), the taste is just great. Great value!"
I used for my refrigerator water and I am very happy
Easy to install
"I bought the two pack and they are original equipment Samsung refrigerator water filters. There are other cheaper replacement water filters. Read the details. Not all replacement filters have as high a NSF/ANSI certification, 53 for this particular filter.As a side note, when we moved we took our Samsung refrigerator with us. I didn't hook up the water line to the refrigerator right away, wanting to wait until I got the replacement filter. In the meantime, I tried to remove the existing filter, with no luck. I later learned if water isn't being supplied to the refrigerator, it's nearly impossible to pull out the existing filer. Once I got the replacement water filter, I hooked up the water supply line, turned the existing filter to the unlock position, and was able to easily pull out the old filter."
I made the mistake of buy an off brand for my fridge.  One worked ok.  The second one didn't filter the chlorine and dripped.  Made a mess in my fridge.  I quickly bought the correct one made by Samsung.
I have read somewhere that using the factory water filter will make your loud mouth refrigerator quite. It is more quite and does make different sounds but I question if it is worth 3 times as much as an aftermarket filter.
Never had a problem as long as I used original Samsung parts.  Did not like generics
French door SAMSUNG Refrigerator needs water/ice filter replaced every 6 months or the filter will get clogged up. OEM equipment perfect for the swap out.
"Have bought a couple of these over the years for the same fridge, and the quality is always the same. Lasts around 8-12 months depending on how much water is filtered (have a household of 7+ people). Just be careful that the model filer you buy is compatible with your fridge."
"Wrong filter, ordered the correct one. Make sure you get the numbers off the old filter.  Do not go by your refrigerator model number"
"Bought this water filter for my Samsung refrigerator. Makes your water have great flavor, easy to install. Great value for your money. Definitely recommend it to anyone!! Cheaper than stores"
"This sale was suppose to come with 2 filters, only one arrived."
"I’ve used the generic brand for the last year and a half but the last one that I got only lasted about a month and was leaking like crazy. I finally decided that it was time to go back to the genuine filters. Best decision ever. The water tastes better, I have a strong out of the dispenser, and no more leaks!"
"I only gave three stars for value because there is a less expensive after market filter out there that probably works just as well. I chose the Samsung filter, so Samsung couldn't deny doing warranty work claiming I didn't use the proper filter."
"I've tried other off-brand filters for my Samsung refrigerators, I find that only the OEM Samsung brand has the life span and filtering quality expected. I definitely see and taste the difference, and having several on hand makes it easy to replace every six months. The proof for me was seeing how the other filters trended to clog and fail prematurely on my home, softened water lines. The Samsung holds up and keeps filtering with fast water delivery even with the additional density of a water softeners extra minerals in the water. The others would just slow and eventually clog within one week of installing my monthly water softener cell. Worth the money to me for the OEM quality and life."
"On my lame point of view, it looks legit. Had all Samsung labels, all prints are of high quality. The indicator sticker changed to green on the magnet. I think its an original product. However, the bar code on the box was colored back with a sharpie so it couldn't be read. That seemed weird."
I tested the water quality after installing the filter and it is just like tap water (TDS is nearly 300 ppm)!!!Update: changed to 3 star. I returned this and ordered one from Samsung. However i still have similar issue. Googled YouTube on water testing videos and saw similar problems with this filter. Now i think it is more likely Samsung’s problem.
This is a very good price for back up filters for my refrigerator.  So glad to see a set of three for this price. Helps the pocket. Thank you.
working good so far. first one worked good for almost exact 6 months and just replaced with the other. No problems yet.
"I bought a knockoff brand filter from Home Depot and it was horrible. The water was not good. I returned it and bought this one.  The water is amazing: clear, distinct and refreshing."
"This worked really well on our Samsung fridge. There are knockoff versions out there that borderline trick you into thinking you're buying an actual Samsung-branded unit, but this one is the real, legit deal. It installed perfectly, and after running water through it for about 5 minutes, most of the air was out of the line and the stream of water out of the fridge was steady. We noticed a sizable increase in the flow rate of water after replacing the old filter (which I think the previous homeowner had probably left in there for several years without replacing).Just be careful when you take the old unit out, because water will definitely pour out of it if you tilt it the wrong way."
need to purchase more than 1
"After 3 months of dealing with a leaking Samsung  fridge, paying 2 repairmen 85 bucks each, calling the factory, and mopping up water in and around it every week or so, I have finally solved the problem. The filter was defective and did not fit properly. It was a Refresh brand that was much less expensive. Lesson learned. When I installed the actual Samsung filter, the leak stopped immediately. It is pricey, but worth it. Why all of the sources did not know the problem is a mystery to me. Get the real thing and save yourself from this problem. I love my fridge again!"
"I replace my water filters multiple times a year.  I've tried the non-oem (original equipment manufacturer) brands.... the cheaper ones... and ended up buying the Samsung filters and throwing the knock offs away.  Why? I could ""taste"" the water.  Which means the filter added a taste to the water which should not be there.  The Samsung filters do NOT do this.  So, I just buy them now.  Enough said."
"This item is just fine for our refrigerator as it is what Samsung endorses.  It is fine for fit and working well to purify our water.  I think it is a bit overpriced, however.  I wish I could find a less expensive fit."
"It truly is the original manufacturer product, not a cheap imitation. It installed cleanly with no issues and works without leaks. I did deduct one star due to the 'off' taste that was present in the water for about the first (6) 20-oz glasses that were processed through the filter. But it had gone away by the 7th glass.Since Samsung recommends that these filters be changed every 6 months I will definitely be purchasing this again.P.S. by 'off' taste I mean that the water smelled like a cat's mouth. Every smelled a cat's mouth? Not pleasant. Def not something you want to put in your own mouth."
"My initial replacement filter was a 3rd party product.  It worked well until it was time to replace it.  We were getting very weird noises from the refrigerator and the water pressure was low.  We thought that we had an issue, not realizing it was due to the filter.  I then bought another 3rd party filter.  It didn't work.  Despite the claims, the filter did not fit our refrigerator and water was pouring out when I tried to install it.  (Fortunately, I was able to return the filter and got a full refund.)  Finally, I paid the price for a Samsung (OEM) filter.  It has been performing perfectly.  The moral is to simply buy this product and spend a few dollars more."
The work and don't leak
"It kills me to have to pay so much more for the branded filter but the reality is that the house brand filters that Home Depot offers have a substantially LOWER flow rate. These original Samsung filters have much better flow. That said, I'm not sure if it's because there's just less ""going on"" inside of it or if the Home Depot HDX filters are just lousy. There's no visible difference in the water between the two, but I wouldn't expect there to be anyway (and my city water is really good any way; truth is, if I could just plug some sort of bypass in the filter opening, I'd skip the filters entirely)."
"I have used these filters for years and always have had excellent results. I am not able to drink the nasty tasting water. Maybe this was not a genuine Samsung filter??? I would have given 0 stars, but there is no way to do that which is unfair because I have to check one star or my review will not be accepted!!!"
Product was ordered so I would have it on hand to replace current one when needed.
Now my refrigerator stopped shining the red light to tell me it needed a new filter.  Very easy to install.  Fast shipping.
Works perfectly with
"Ordered two of this product. Received only one. Contacted vendor, who was personable enough, but then started speaking of my personal information that I do not feel he should have had access.Conversation was too long, his main concern was that I give him a good recommendation. A week later I finally received the second item. So overall the product and delivery was good."
"Four star rating because of quality and function.  This filter always appears to be good quality and function as intended.  However, it is very expensive, regardless of where you try to purchase it.  I read a review here from 2013 about this filter not requiring replacement until flow decreases.  This would help with the overall cost.  Will continue to read reviews on third party filters since they are less than half the price.  Curious to see how good their quality is and how long they could last.  My fridge model number is RF4287HARS/XAA."
"Real deal with verification sticker to validate on Samsung’s website. Works as the OEM intended. Cheap ones leak, be aware. Moving forward I will always use Samsung. So far so good."
"I tried the aftermarket filters and the ones sold as replacements from the brick and mortar stores, but if you want your Samsung Water and Ice Thru the Door features to provide the best performance you must get the actual Samsung brand filters else you will see a noticeably slower water stream and less ice availability. For those if us who have Samsung Water and Ice thru the door refrigerators you already know these are not good at creating ice, if you have a family of more than 2 and use ice for your drinks in the summer, you won't be happy with Samsung, but you MUST use these filters to get the maximum performance from your Samsung Refrigerator."
"Although these filters are somewhat expensive, I trust them more than the off-brand filters. I don't want to worry about causing any issues in my fridge by using an off-brand filter. I feel comfortable with the Samsung brand filter, and I know it works well. The water tastes great, and I love having filtered water out of my refrigerator. It's especially beneficial in Arizona, where we live, which has extremely hard water. The tap water does not taste great, and I hate buying bottled water all the time.I would say this filter is worth the money, and it was fast delivery. It's still cheaper to buy it on Amazon than it is to buy anywhere else online or to buy direct from Samsung."
"I purchased this filter for my Samsung Refrigerator. It was an exact fit and very easy to install.  I was a bit confused by some other reviews which complained about the flow being restricted.  If it did at all I couldn't notice.  The flow is still very good.  I did purchase my home and this Samsung was already in the home....so perhaps it already had this part number filter already installed although it looked like my original had the original number these other people wrote about.  In either case I am extremely satisfied with this filter.  Not only because of the ease of installation, but also because it has great flow and more importantly the water tastes great."
"While these are not inexpensive, it is important to know that there are two standards for water filters.These are the real deal - they meet both sets of ANSI/NSF standards (42 and 53) where most of, if not all of the lower priced competitors only meet NSF 42, which is the taste and color specification, not the water purification and contaminant elimination (health related) specification.They fit as they are designed by the manufacturer to work in Samsung refrigerators.Saving money may not be in your best interests. Sometimes you do get what you pay for."
"I was happy to find this water filter cartridge replacement for my refrigerator.  It lasts about 6 months and is quite easy to replace in my 3-door Samsung fridge.  Not always easy to find in my local hardware or grocery stores.  The old cartridge pops out easily and new one is inserted at about waist level on the front of the fridge, so no more bending down to the floor and removing the grill like I had to do on my previous refrigerator.  Finally, someone put some common sense into the newer designs for these water filters."
OEM works great.  Don’t buy off brand I made that mistake and it leaked.  Spend the extra and buy name brand
Make sure the Samsung filter sold by Amazon will fit your refrigerator. The Samsung filter sold on Amazon does not universally fit all Samsung French door refrigerators. Even the Samsung dealer was barely able to determine and locate the correct filter so the problem is ABT/Samsung. I purchased the filter a bit ahead of need so I would have it on-hand. However by the time all the issues were resolved the return window for Amazon had expired.
Great value and does a great job
OEM filter that has directions for easy installation (if you turn off the water it is easy).  The delivery was fast and the price was good.  I've used twice now and recommend.
"This filter does have a smaller opening than the older models as many have pointed out, but I don't think that's a problem.  The last filter I bought before this one was the cheapest one available on Amazon and I had no water pressure to the water dispenser in the door.  I stuck with it since it did work, albeit not so great.  When it was time to replace it, I spent a few more dollars and got the Samsung branded filter. My water pressure is back to normal.  I flushed about a half-gallon of water through it when I first installed it and it has been working great ever since."
"You can save a significant amount of money ordering this through Amazon instead of purchasing at the large hardware stores.  Authentic and no issues when purchasing from ""Amazon"" seller."
"This works just the way you would expect it to. I don't notice any kind of strange aftertaste in the water.  The water tastes ""fresh""."
Easy for replacement
"Love my Samsung refrigerator and have owned it for about seven months.  When the indicator light came on showing I needed a new filter, I went to Lowe's for a replacement.  They were out for TWO weeks.  Home depot was also out!  So, my search began on Amazon to find a replacement.  There were a few off brands that were a few dollars less than this one, but I really wanted to stick with the recommended filter.  Ordered this one and it was delivered in two days!!  It was easy to install and I will definitely be ordering from these folks again.They even sent me an email letting me know it was on the way and asked if I was happy after delivery!  Who does that??Very happy with quality of service from this company."
I noticed an immediate improvement in the taste of the water and in the taste of the ice from our refrigerator's dispenser.
"You don't have a choice about the water filter you use in your Samsung refrigerator, unless a generic is available -- something I wouldn't take a chance on.  The only choice you have is where you'll buy it, and, in this case, I found here to be the cheapest.  (Comparison shop when you need to buy.)  It fits my Samsung French door, model RF4287HARS.Keep in mind that the red light indicating that a chance is needed is timed, not actual need, so if you don't use your water dispenser much, you can delay a bit.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
One of those things you have to have. At least these are delivered to my door.
"Since there are so many reviews stating that this is counterfeit, I was worried. After I received the product, I went to check the Authentication Tag as well as the QR code. The result shows the product I just received is real.BTW, I also found a picture for this filter on Samsung website showing the liters before gallons. So I think this part is OK."
This filter is the original part for our Samsung Refrigerator.  Easy to install and have not anticipated any issues.  Water tastes great every day.  Great price if you buy buy bulk.  Cheaper than buying from your local appliance supply chain even with free shipping.
Easy to install and good price. Fits perfectly. Genuine samsung filter. It even came with a magnet to check if item was genuine.
I shopped around and this was the best price.
Perfect for my Samsung fridge. Will continue to buy when needing replacements. Price is reasonable.
The item was received in good condition within the expected delivery window.
Easy to install water filter
"This is the one they recommend for the Samsung refrigerator that I purchased.  The ice taste pure, and I find that it is easy to install.  I also get 3 for the price of 2 at my local store.  Great savings."
Perfect replacement at a good price. These are hard to find at the big hardware stores.
The filter I received fits perfectly. It went in easy and I have no leaks. Water pressure and flow are good. The O-ring thickness and position on the end of the filter are exactly the same as filters I have previously bought from Lowes. I also compared the box the filter came in with a filter box bought locally. Exactly the same on all 6 sides. Both boxes state the filter came from Mexico. I have never been able to find a filter made in South Korea. I have a shutoff water valve leading to my refrigerator so I always turn off the water and release the pressure prior to changing filters as described in the filter replacement instructions. Never had a problem.
"This is a great deal for our fridge filter! Better than the home improvement stores near us. It helps that you can subscribe and save too, that way you really wont miss a filter change! This product also does really work. We already put our drinking water through reverse osmosis, but then it gets filtered again at the fridge with this filter. We measured the PPM's before and after the filter and the water filtered through this filter had lower PPM's (as hoped)."
"What I ordered, correct brand, and good service."
"I have been buying these genuine filters on Amazon since many years. The main complain is some of these filters have a seriously low water flow. The water flow at the beginning is fine but within few days after installation, it deteriorates. I contacted Amazon once and they replaced it however it is not expected from a genuine product after paying the premium over generic aftermarket filters."
"I ordered this filter with a bit of apprehension, given the slight change in filter design.  We own a Samsung model RF4287HARS manufactured in August 2013.  Compared to the original filter (I have never changed it) there are design changes, as shown in customer images.  However, I have not noticed any issues so far.  No change in water flow, and no dripping to the bottom drawers.The country of origin for the orginal filter was Korea; the replacement is Mexico.  I checked Home Depot and theirs are manufactured in Mexico as well.  So, don't instantly assume it is a counterfeit due to that difference.If any issues are noticed, I will adjust my star rating."
"Samsung filters are expensive but I guess they do what they are supposed to do. Unfortunately, there is no way for the customer to measure the performance. They are easy enough to install and easy to remove and that's good. There are cheaper filters available but no way to measure value."
"Samsung OEM water filter, great tasting water, better than aftermarket or 3rd party water filters that are replacements but not as good as Starbucks water."
"I've added photos of the filters I received on March 11, 2017 (on the left) and November 21, 2017 (on the right), both from Amazon.com LLC (no third party). The newer filter has a double O-ring which required significantly more force to push into the receiver. The end with the ""handle"" is shaped differently, notably more skinny in the newer filter, and that end of the newer cylinder has more taper, which results in an off-center gap around the filter once installed. Nonetheless, it so far appears to function the same."
"These fit perfectly... and should, considering it comes from the manufacturer.  Even with the water source left on, water doesn't leak when changing them.  However, if you leave the water source on in the back, it will be more difficult to unlock the old filter and lock the new filter... I had to use pliers because of the back pressure.  You can make this an EZ procedure by turning off the water in the back first.  (My filter was located in the front, between the vegetable/fruit bins.)I'm giving this filter 4 stars because of the price (I paid $35+)... a little steep."
Began purchasing this on amazon as it has the automatic reorder for six months than going to Lowes each time. Granted Lowes has the reminder but it works better with Amazon.
"A good filter if it keeps our family healthy and worth the cost.  By buying it in a 3 pack we find our savings add up quickly. The metal cartridges seem well made but still somewhat delicate. Although they are pack in somewhat of a thin box they, in my opinion, should have been shipped inside another stronger box rather than in a plastic bag.  The box inside was slightly damaged and crushed.  Thankfully the filters themselves seem OK."
The 2 pack price is reasonable. We usually have to replace the filter in our refrigerator every 6 months.
I like that this worked well with my fridge. For half the price for what I was paying this works just as well. Thank you!!!
"I revised my earlier review after finding the old filter has the same contradictory statements. I guess it's the same filter. Except the new one has two o-rings instead or one. Same molded plastic and label.  The statements on the label  still strike me as odd so I left the photos and original review below...The label on the filter contained contradictory statements it advises it is ""tested and certified by NSF"" in a text box with white background. However it advises ""*not certified by NSF International or the State of California"" at the very bottom of the label. Photo attached.  So is it certified or not?"
"This was a replacement filter for my Samsung Refrigerator.  The filter was easy to install.  I just turned the adapter from the old filter, placed the new one in the adapter, turned the filter and was done.  Simple and easy!"
"Only like it because I don't trust the other cheap knock off version to not leach chemicals.For those of you who know what TDS is and how to measure, this basically takes my tap TDS from 190 to 167. For those that don't know what TDS is, this filter removes about 10% of the actual particles in the water and the chlorine and makes it taste better.If there was a way to get a filter to take the TDS under 100 I would pay double what these cost and maybe even drink the water."
"Was concerned about getting this due to several reviews saying that it leaked due to design changes etc. Tried anyway, happy to say all fine and working well. Purchased August 21, 2016 so the design changes may have caught up to the problems people were having. The part that is inserted into the Samsung Refrigerator is more angled than rounded as my old one was. But at the tip that actually connects the hole was the same size as the one I took out. (Some photos I saw in reviews had the hole much smaller in the newer one.) The angled cylinder top didn't seem to make any difference. It fit fine, is working fine and not leaking."
"Have arthritic fingers, so good pair of pliers help that last twist to lock in place.  I stay with brand name.  Have never used a generic refrigerator filter."
"This fits perfectly in my fridge (Model # RF28HFEDBWW/AA). The original part for my fridge was supposed to be the DA29-00019A filter and this filter was mentioned as the replacement on Samsung's website. I bought this with some trepidation because there was a negative review saying that this item (DA29-00020B) did not work as a replacement for the 19A filter, and a question I asked on Amazon had mixed responses. It turned out that it does work, and we have cool, great tasting filtered water again!Also the item I got was rated ""Particulate Class I"" whereas my fridge originally came with a ""Particulate Class III"" filter. So overall it looks like I got a better filter than I had for a much better price than buying at a store."
"Easy to install. Works great. I purchased and off brand the water tasted terrible. I went back to this ""Samsung"" product. I installed it, ran 3 gallons of water through it and the water taste great. It is much more expensive than the off brand."
"This filter is very easy to install and has been a staple buy from Amazon since we got the refrigerator. Quality product, just be sure to run a couple of gallons through it before using it."
I’ve use this before in my refrigerator so I just bought a replacement I like it very well
Amazing product. Easy to install and reasonable priced. There was some doubt that these were knock offs but this is the brand Samsung suggest when you order from build in app. I have Samsung family hub refrigerator and I tried to order directly . It was out of stock so ordered from Amazon
"Reviewers suggest that there may be a ""non-US"" model of this filter which leaks, but the one I received fit perfectly in my new refrigerator and it does not leak. It was annoying to have to pull out the refrigerator and shut off the water to change the filter, but that's not the filter's fault. I don't have the time or money to waste on a non-Samsung filter."
"Samsung refrigerator filter is by far one of the best.  I have been using this brand for over a year. I like the quality.  If you don't drink water from the refrigerator or not using the ice from it often,the filter may last longer than 6 months. In my case, our refrigerator is set to have it replaced every 6 months.  I gave 4 stars since it is costly. Overall quality is great, no water dripping, water is fresh and clear. That fits perfect for Samsung REF"
After reading the reviews I was nervous that I would receive a non-authentic Samsung filter. But as you can see from the pictures I have included there’s an authentication tag that’s on the filter where you are able to check that it actually is authentic.
Fits perfectly
We've been using these filters for over a year and they're great. They last 5-6 months in our fridge. It's a little annoying that you have to run 3 gallons of water through it when changing but that's standard. When they start to go bad you can really taste the difference. We've tried 4 different brands including the original from Samsung and these are much better for the price. To be clear this isn't an original Samsung filter this is Amazon's version of the original. Fits perfectly and gets the job done really well.
Works great with out Samsung fridge
Works perfectly!
"Fair pricing, compared to big box stores . . but pricey compared to generic brands.Arrived in good time with no problems.This was my first replacement filter for my Samsung refrigerator, and installation was simple and no leaks.Generic brands are about one half the cost of a ""Samsung"" filter, but the marketing angle built in to the owner's manualdid a great job of scaring the hell out of me that a non genuine filter could void the warranty and ruin my (hardwood) kitchen floorfrom possible leakage.Anyway . . a good filter, easy to order, and on my doorstep in just a few days."
Easy and simple to installLast 6 months!!
These are genuine Samsung filters! Perfect fit! Excellent value.  HINT : If you have the Lowe's extended warranty they will reimburse you for some of the cost.
It is hard to beat OEM.
This item is the exact water filter you'd purchase locally or from Samsungs website. I authenticated this water filter as well. Perfect product! Thank you! :)
"Package arrived as promised. No damage. Inside the box two filters in the original box. They were open and slightly banged up. Returned items? Both filters were wrapped in plastifoil.The filter have an Authentication Tag. But, only one Filter had this item.Reading reports about Amazon, I felt a little bit uneasy."
Great value
Works great
"This is my third set of these OEM original filters. This last set, the filter clogged about 2 months into use. The water would only trickle out of the water dispenser on the front of the fridge when filling a glass. After checking to make sure the lines had no kinks, I changed out the filter and all was normal again with a strong flow of water. They work great but one star knockdown for one of the filters not lasting until regular replacement."
"This is a ‘real’ Samsung water filter. I did buy 1 before that was a lot cheaper & said it was compatible. Of course it destroyed the water line & cost $200 to repair. I only buy from here when necessary anymore because although it’s convenient, it’s almost always some sort of fake or knockoff product & the prices are better either in store or on the website. 4 stars because of the shipping costs"
"The filters were a good deal vs buying at a retailer like Best Buy however after using the filter, the water has an odd taste to it. I’ve used these filters before, but this one is off… wouldn’t recommend"
"My Samsung refrigerator is not that all great, but this filter does a great job of providing filtered water. It tastes great, and our family never has to worry about water because, for each filter, it provides 300 gals of water. How cool is that? I love it!!! I'll buy it again anytime."
"We all have to replace the refrigerator water filter, and somehow I feel better using the same brand (Samsung) as the refrigerator, even if its more expensive than generic filters. So, I buy the double pack every year, and replace every six moths. Easy to remove/replace the old filter. Wish was a bit less expensive."
"We got a new refrigerator in September, but when the purple light went indicating a new filter would be needed soon, darned if I could find one in town.  Not even the place where I purchased the refrigerator had them!  It took some searching online to find the correct filter, since the number in my appliance manual and the replacement filter were not the same.  Imagine that - in 4 months, it all changed.  Very frustrating, but I was happy to find it online and that it arrived at my home in 48 hours.  We consume a lot of water, which is one of the reasons for buying the refrigerator in the first place.  I will be sure to order these again, as I received excellent service and I'm not about to waste my time running all over to track down water filters."
Quick & easy to install. Great value. Will sign up for subscribe & save every 6 months so I don’t forget to change it!
A very simple cartridge to replace on the Fridge we have.  Water tastes much better than straight tap water after filtration.
This filter is easy to install.
"My ice maker did not work. When I put the new filter in, it did work. it was easy to install."
"I wish it would taste more like bottled water, thw tadte is not much different from my sink wster"
Don t order “knock offs”.  Get real thing.  I previously ordered cheaper knock offs and ended up with water all over my floor!
"The price,  a little too much."
Once you realize how it is inserted it’s simple but I was confounded for a time.
"Its kind of hard to get too excited about a refrigerator water filter.  But I put it in; and I guess it works.  But the Samsung instructions in its refrigerator manual and on the box are so unclear that it took quite some time to get it in and know that it was in properly and to get the filter re-set from red to blue.  But the product seems to work fine, as best as one can tell how a water filter is working.  And I do not know how long it will last, an issue raised by other reviewers.Even at Amazon, it seems to be way overpriced for what it is."
"Este filtro me gusta mucho por varias razones, el precio aquí en amazon es mas económico que en las tiendas departamentales, el tiempo de uso es el justo aproximadamente 5-6 meses en una familia de 6.El sabor del agua es normal."
OEM Product for the price of generic!Great product from Samsung!  Installs easily and will last six months or longer!
"I received an open empty bag, but after contacting amazon, they agreed to replace it. The filter works great."
"The generic cost more than Samsung. Of course, you will buy the product that is supposed to go in your refrigerator over a generic when it costs less. Samsung products last longer too!"
I've ordered these several times and mine have always been genuine Samsung made. Make sure it has the Samsung hologram seal in upper right corner to know it's legit. They work great and I change them every six months.
"Cheaper here than at local Lowe's.  For safety's sake, I prefer using name brand products with appliances. This is a tight fit and seals with a push/twist."
"We have ordered the single pack in the past, but this time we went for the 3-pack to save some money over the long term. The packaging of each individual filter was different than the filters sold individually, but it looked legitimate. Our filter leaked a little bit at the rubber o-ring, which was a bit upsetting since we had three of them. I took the leaking filter out of the refrigerator and applied some food-grade lubricant (look for keg lube at your local beer brewing store or other food service store) to the o-ring. The lubricant definitely helped as we have not had any leaks now in over two weeks."
Seems legitimate some of the reviews says it’s a not real or fake but worked for me I will buy again
Works great!
"The refrigerator was purchased in 2011, installed in 2012. I have never used anything but genuine products. This one is the same as all the others, fits well, does not leak...OK, it did leak once right after putting it on. It was making a noise where I did not get a good seal. The second time pushed harder and no issues. Why they cost so much more than the knock offs, I do not know."
Precio económico en función de un producto original.
These are real Samsung brand water filters. Same kind you get at the Depot but a bit cheaper. Easy to install and easy to setup. You basically you twist the filter in the direction indicated to remove and install it. Than you pump 5 gallons or so of water through it. The taste is good and the water runs clear.Would recommend this product.
"Filter works great, but very over priced.  Other options work just as well for less than half the price."
"I received my new filter today. The box looks genuine and included the authentication tag on the filter that Samsung states they have to help determine authenticity (on website - pic attached).I did the authenticity test and saw the stripes the same as on the website but I have to admit, I’m skeptical now. Once a doubt is placed on my mind (especially one that can impact health), I don’t take it lightly.The price today is the exact same as the samsung website so for future purchases I’ll be going direct.The water seems great and clear again and my ice is better than before (even on cubes it was flaking little crushed pieces) - I just want to make sure it’s really provided by the manufacturer when I purchase next time."
"These are the real deal, the same as we have in the past paid $50 each at Loews. We tried some of the cheaper knockoffs. One in three of the knockoffs leaked and was unusable. You can tell the real deal, it will have two “O” ring seals on the inlet of the filter. Knockoffs only have 1 “O” ring."
"Works great.  Very expensive.  Didn't want to take a chance with aftermarket filters as I read reviews about these aftermarket having ill fitting, slow water, noises when dispensing etc.  So I went OEM.  Amazon has a much better price than what I could buy it for locally.Just turn off water first, relieve pressure, and replace.  Easy.One star knocked off due to the stupid expensive price on these.  With that being said, don't replace your filter just because the light comes on.  Replace when the water stream is getting very slow."
I simply don't understand why people spend a little less money on the knock offs. I've read with most of them there are problems with not fitting well and if one considers that these last for six months the extra cost per day is miniscule. These always fit my Samsung refrigerator and perform beautifully. They also come with a document showing precisely what chemicals and the percentages this filter cleans for you. That's not true with many of the knock offs. You don't know what kind of quality your getting with the others and clearness of the water is not a method of determining a filters effectiveness.
"They definitely improve the taste of the water and ice cubes.  But at $40-50 a pop, that's hard to swallow compared to filters like Britta."
Purchase to have as replacement when needed
Good
"it worked perfectly and performed great, if you’re looking for a filter for your Samsung refrigerator I recommend this one!"
Strange that they say you should just throw these away in trash and not recycle the materials. I think they should have a program to recycle or re-use them somehow.
Cheaper than buying this in the store
"These are the same product we could buy locally, but cost less when we order them from Amazon.  We are very happy with the filters and the savings."
I keep ordering this brand even though you can get off brand ones much cheaper. I am very satisfied with how the tap water tastes after passing through this filter. I do think they are over-priced. If I could be sure other brands worked just as well I would switch. I don't drink bottled water so I really want the water from my refrigerator to taste great. Went down one star due to the cost.
I bought it like new for discount.  Only the package was damaged.  The filters are great. Easy to install and work fine!
It is good price it is cheaper than Best Buy or Home Depot for almost 10 bucks when I bought it I could save more if I have bought the pair but I just needed one at that time.
"OEM Filter MUCH better than the cheaper generic.... I wanted to save some $$ so ordered the less expensive option.... the water didn't taste as good and so we stopped using it and started using the RO at the sink (which tasted better but not as good as the OEM filter in the fridge).... Then when I put the second generic filter in, the fridge started to leak and occasioned a service call from the appliance repair....  The generic was not seating properly into the filter case and caused the leaking.... Ordered the OEM Samsung filters, inserted them, and have had great tasting water and no problems since..... In the end the OEM are a better choice!"
These are legitimate Samsung filters. They work just as they should. Always make sure to order from Amazon and not a third party.
The generics filter nothing in comparison to this. Check the charts before you buy generic. I live by farmland so water contamination is always in my mind.
Like always I’m very satisfied with thi product
"I have been buying this same water filter for years and its the same one that came with my Samsung refrigerator. I have a higher iron content in my water even though I have a water softener and this filter handles the water fine. No issues, no complaints."
Always prefer Samsung brand .. tried once another brand and water taste was really bad.. so always go with Samsung brand..
"This filter fits our refrigerator and delivers clean, clear and quality tasting water and ice. It was way to install and was a great value."
Great price....better than a home store!
"These are the factory replacement water filters for the Samsung refrigerators.  They work well, and there's a noticeable difference in the taste of the water when they're new versus 6 months later when it's time to replace them.  They seem to filter pretty well, and I use the filtered water when cooking as well.  They're easy to swap out as well.  They used to come with date stickers in the box, but for some reason they don't have them anymore.  It was really helpful for knowing which month I put the filter in so I can see how long they last before replacing them."
Easy to replace and works great.
"Good quality filter replacement, use it for Samsung RS265TDBP. Easy to install, works well, good tasting water."
"Prices for official Samsung products will always be higher, but quality control and consistency is worth the extra price in my opinion.These work as intended from what I've seen. I have no reason to think I received counterfeit filters, although it seems that is an ongoing problem from reading other reviews.This is incredibly simple to install, with a simple twist mechanism to remove the old filter and twist the new one back in. These come with good documentation providing benchmarks done in laboratory conditions providing the filtering capabilities of these filters.I ordered a multipack, which came as two individual units taped together."
"Fit and worked liked it should.  Non-Samsung filter clogged on me, never again."
I have bought many of these. Works well and easy to install. Best price I can find.
"What can I really say about a water filter?  They filter water.  I am very happy with this purchase as the price for the filters beat what I could purchase them in the store for.  I purchased the 2-pack for just over $50, which is what the stores are getting for one.  These are ORIGINAL Samsung filters in the original packaging.  I could have purchased an aftermarket product, but after reading a number of reviews, I was a bit concerned about them leaking around the seal.  I don't think you can go wrong with this purchase and save almost 50% over retail in the process."
"I usually buy this product at my local best buy for a good chunk of change. When I saw this package I had to try it out. It worked exactly the same as the one I would purchase at best buy but the cost is considerably less! I think the price of 3 here is the price of 1 at BB. I'm all for saving money (and also saves me a trip to BB). I've ordered it 2 times and they last for quite awhile (about 4-6 months). Of course this will depend on how much you use your filtered water. As long as price stay this way, I will keep purchasing for my refridgerator."
"The filter itself works fine. I did not notice any leaks or difference in taste as compared to the original filter that came with the refrigerator. However, I do not like the way Samsung counts the filter usage. It is merely based on a timer and not on actual water use. We do not use the filter a lot but still a replacement notification pops up after 6 months. Samsung should find out a better way to relate filter use with replacement need."
"Shipping was easy.  It was easy to install, plus next time I need to order, it is saved right on the site."
"They are now as efficient as they were when we bought our new fridge.  The Water is not clear and there are super fine particles in the bottom of glasses, coffee makers etc.. This filter was installed in February and the particles began to show up in April or May. The suggested replacement is 6 months.  We are disappointed with this and it is the brand recommended. Quality is not as expected"
Great product.  Fast shipment.
"It took me a while to figure out where to install it, but once I did, the product is easy to use."
Exactly as described
"Put it in my refrigerator, to replace my HAF-CIN/XME.  I thought it was touch and go for a while, as the refrigerator gurgled, shot water at extremely high pressure, and some other strange things.  After running it for, maybe 12 cups, it seems fine.  No more strange pressure, or gurgles.  Two days later, no puddles or leaks anywhere.  Probably fine.This is the HAF-CIN/EXP, which is all I could find, they don't carry the XME anywhere---but they are apparently made to fit the same ports on the refrigerator."
"Perfect replacement. I was so happy to find this with fast prime shipping. It was the exact replacement we needed. We just bought our house, we were unsure of which filter it needed. Easy to find on Amazon and perfect replacement"
This item installed much easier than the last one we used. Last one took pliers to turn to lock in place this one thankfully turned into locked position fairly easy.
Fit my fridge just fine. So far so good.
"Excellent filter, easy to install, eliminates odors and impurities. A little pricey"
"My preference is to use a filter made by or recommended by Samsung for their refrigerator, knowing that it's more likely to fit properly and perform as expected.  There are many generics out there that are probably less expensive, but I would rather not take a chance that could result in a water leak and related damage.  It seems to work as intended and we use the water and ice from the refrigerator for drinking and cooking because of this filter and what it's supposed to be doing."
I just installed the filter in my refrigerator. I had to replace the original filter that came with the fridge when we purchased it on September 2013. The original fit perfectly and when it was in the filter chamber the arrow on the filter when locked aligned exactly with the arrow on the chamber. The new filter arrow didn't align with the arrow on the chamber when locked so I wasn't sure it was actually locked all the way and was worried it would leak. I had to test a few times and then to pull vegetables and fruit drawers out to check there is no accumulation of water underneath.
"I was nervous about ordering these based on other reviews, but we received 2 sealed authentic Samsung filters. Same that we would buy at any home improvement/appliance store! Great value for the price, set of 2!!! Works great, and easy to install!"
These ju
Perfect fit.
Nice that you get two filters. cost is average
I like this product because it costs less than the “big box” stores and it’s an identical replacement water filter for my refrigerator/freezer.
Great product fir great price promptly delivered
"Seems there is always a debate on if these are OEM or not. They look OEM, they fit well with no leaks, and they do the job, as the fridge water is clean and clear. Would buy again."
"Fits perfectly, no leaks, no sediment in glass. Water tastes like good water."
Worked out okay. The filter looked the same as the old one but when I put it in the first time it leaked a lot of water before I noticed it. I removed the filter and put it back in and it was fine! I took it back out and reinstalled it and it leaked again! Reinstalling again cured the leak. I can't figure out why it leaked the first time or the third time. Seems to work only on the even numbered installations. Curious. Tried to buy the filter locally but nobody had it in stock. I got it faster and for a lower price at Amazon.
"The products really work, and I’m glad because at the store of Sears call some more, thank you for the low price!"
It works well with my Samsung refrigerator. Knock off don't work well
"We recently attempted to save by purchasing another filter that was advertised as compatible with our refrigerator...and paid the price when we discovered that the fridge was leaking water! They saved cost by reducing the number of rubber gaskets used to ensure a complete seal. This filter has three gaskets, and we have had zero problems with it. Yes, it's a bit more expensive than the other models, but trust me - you'll regret saving $10 if you go with one of the other filters and spend hours cleaning water from everywhere in your fridge!"
"Great price on these water filter replacements.. same part number as the one I took out of my Samsung Fridge (the kind with lcd touch screen).  They only last 6 months, but much better to buy from here than pay 2x as much at a local retailer.Installation was a snap.Ran the drink water tap on the fridge, water spit, gurgled, made a slight mess until the new one filled up with water and expelled the air inside it.  Not that big a deal.I would suggest doing this, as you don't want this happening inside your ice maker, so I think one should ""bleed"" the system after installation.Buy with confidence.  Genuine Samsung label on it that matched the original that came out of mine."
The fit was correct and it seems to do what it is suppose to do. Makes our Arizona water drinkable from the dispenser in our refrigerator.
Perfect fit... Looks and send to behave like the one that came with it.
Was cheaper then almost all the harddware stores I looked at.  Super easy to install.
"Cheaper 3rd party options are out there, but I don't like to skimp where safety is a factor. This filter traps all the bad stuff and fits my refrigerator just like the original one did. No problems with leaks as other reviewers have said. It does look like the circular opening at the business end of the filter is now larger than on my previous Samsung filter, but that can only increase the flow rate, I figure, so that's a plus. The O ring prevents any leaks, as it's designed to do. In short, no problems, and I'll be getting another one of these in about 6 months."
"Yes, this appears to be the genuine article.  Yes, it worked great, fit great and was totally satisfactory.  Yes, it appears that one is actually purchasing these filters from Samsung.  But, my issue is that this is a *Prime* product and the shipping makes it much higher than it initially appears.  Unless you've had the foresight to order through Subscribe and Save, you're overpaying.  Actually, I beat the subscribe and save price. I went online and found these filters for $35.14 each from a fast filter place.  The reviews are high and I feel confident I'll receive the genuine article.  There is no reason for a prime product to have shipping attached.  And the price has gone up by $12 a filter since I bought the first one which was very close to what I found online.  Please don't be ripped off.  You *can* find the genuine article for Much Less."
Compare the NSF contaminant filtering to the cheaper brands. The Samsung filters out more.
"This filters looks like a legit Samsung water filter. Our fridge water pressure started getting weaker, and that's a sign the filter needs to be replaced. This was a few bucks cheaper than the local hardware stores and I was fine waiting 2 days with my Prime shipping. Installed per directions and ran a few gallons through before testing for drink-ability. No funky filter tastes. I am pleased."
I've bought these at Best Buy and paid way more there. This is certified Samsung product at a way cheaper price!
Genuine Samsung filter. Price is comparable to local hardware stores but wish is could be a little less expensive.
Perfect replacement. No issues. I'd rather pay a little extra and get the original part rather than after market products.
This is where to order the filters for refrigerator.
"I ordered an official Samsung brand water filter and that is what I received.  The light on my fridge is timed at six months and that is about when these filters start to slow down in flow.  These are easy to install if you turn off the water supply.  My only gripes are the cost and the priming.  I know I will pay more for the official brand filter but geez.  Even at the amazon price it makes me cringe a little.  As for the priming, I stand at the fridge and empty the 3 gallons from the tap as it asks.  I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.  Ok bye."
Good replacement filters always follow instructions of your appliances
Everything was great with this filter except it already is clogged up and it’s only been installed for about 2.5 months. They have been doing work outside our house on water lines and all but still seems crazy to get clogged so fast. Water slow from fridge door and hardly makes ice. Need to already replace..
"Perfect for our refrigerator.  I wish they were less expensive, but it's what we need & ordered."
"To install you must remember to turn off the main water to the house or the valve to the water hose to the icemaker, then turn on the closest sink to relieve pressure otherwise you need the hulk to get it out, I always use a sharpie to date The filter."
"No change in taste of water, push in and it's ready to work. Price better than big box stores."
"The unit slipped in as instructed.  But have to be careful that it is all the way in, otherwise you can get a minor flood as a partially inserted filter opens the valve.  If the filter is not installed, the valve doesn't open, and you are safe.  But make sure that it is completely in."
It nice
"I could have purchased several filter made by various companies that were far less expensive, but they were probably China knockoffs.  Went with the name brand because I know it works."
"These are pretty costly filters, so this is a decent value vs being in the store.  They are the exact model and fit for my fridge and work great.  This is the second time I've ordered and am happy."
The description promised 2 filters but I only received one. I was not refunded the extra money paid although I complained. Poor customer service. The product is genuine.
"I’ve been using OEM filter. Oh my! Installation is much easier than the oem brand.  Whenever I install the new oem filter, I had to try at least 5 times so that the water doesn’t leak.  I was going to order oem brand but during that time oem brand was on backorder and I didn’t have choice but to order Samsung.  Filter goes in smoothly and fits perfect! No more leaking waters!"
"Good product, but too overpriced as compared to other filters"
"When the little light on the fridge says put a new one in, I do.  I always use the genuine Samsung brand - never any leaks.  Easy out with the old one, easy in with the new one."
Have found that original equipment replacements have that extra quality that is lacking in non OEM. My water filter gives me better water flavor.
Read the specs very carefully. You can buy much cheaper but the inexpensive ones remove fewer contaminants which I don't recommend.  Stick with the good ones folks.
Oem works perfect. Remember to let it run before you drink.
Perfect. Same as the original. Highly recommended.
Easy .. gave it to my son and he changed it really quick.
These are good replacement filters for Samsung refrigerators. There was no problem with the install and use.
This item is a genuine Samsung filter for my Samsung refrigerator.  Therefore it works and fits just like the original.
The filter was so easy to install !  Two steps you are done !
"Exactly what I needed, if you have a Samsung fridge this is the same you get from sears for a better price. Easy to replace if you've done it before."
"We bought a two pack and there was a one month return window. The first filter worked fine, but the second filter is defective. As water filters typically last a number of months, there is no way to contact the seller to return the defective filter as the return window is closed. No water comes through the defective filter"
"I had bought a two-pack set on November 4th 2019. I have used these filters before and they were fine. But this time, after I installed the first one, there isn't much flow of water. I waited for a few days to see if that would change but it got worse. I installed the old filter back and the flow was better than the new one. So, I thought it could be the filter and I installed the second (new) filter from the pack and the water flow still is bad. I ran the second one for a few days and the flow gotten worse. I think this set of filters is defective. I wouldn't generalize my review for all filters because the previous filters were fine. Since I used both of them I don't think I can return them at this point. One annoying thing is, there's no customer service number for the filters listed on the box. I will contact Samsung soon to see what they will say."
Great price and fast shipment.
I have the subscription for our Samsung refrigerator and it always arrives a few weeks before I have to change the filter.
Affordable price and it works.
"There are cheaper filters but went with this for ease of mind, perfect fit and great flavor."
Works wonderfully
I needed replacement filters for my fridge and these were a better value.
Easy to install.  And since  it's  a Samsung  filter going into a Samsung  refrigerator  then  no problem.  About a minute  to change out.
"I purchased what looks like original Samsung replacement filters. There are a few typos in the French text on the labels but I still think the product is not a fake.The first time I installed this replacement filter, it started leaking water into the wide deli drawer underneath (arrangement might depend on fridge model). I took out and put the filter back in a few more times, as well as dispensing a gallon of water after putting it in to remove any air from the system. Now the system finally seems to be tight. No more leaking water in the drawer for the past two days. Filter works as promised but only 3 stars for the hassle and unreliability of the replacement process.Note: The tip to dispense 1 gal of water from the system came from a Samsung troubleshooting video on Youtube. No idea how air can cause a leaking filter but the advice seems to have worked."
The price was a real buy and I received it in a short time.
Works as it should.  Easy to install.  What more can I say. I just wish the price would come down.
"I bought this after an aftermarket replacement was leaking gallons of water down my crisper each week.  After troubleshooting, it turns out the cheaper alternate was the culprit.  I ordered this and VOILA!  Problems gone!  Thank you for having this online and cheaper than at Lowes and local hardware stores.  Shipping was fast too; PRIME BABY!PLEASE ONLY USE SAMSUNG ORIGINAL PARTS ON THE SAMSUNG REFRIGERATORS!  LESSON LEARNED."
"It is the exact item I needed at the best price I found, and I shoulda got two at that price.BTW, since this item is what I expected, I'd normally give it 3 stars, but since it was a better than average price, and arrive quickly I added one more.Notice when I say shoulda got more, I mean to buy multiple SINGLE packs.  Notice 3 single packs ($29.47 * 3) costs $88.41, but the three pack (where they get to save shipping by using a single shipping container) costs $92.90 ($4.49 more).Reminds me of the joke where the Three Stooges sell cups of lemonade for $0.25 each, or 3 for a dollar."
Product easy to install and works well
"Mine have been lasting around a year. I’m a single guy, and no I’m not asking you to go out, but the filter sucks probably last shorter for a family."
"The only issue I have is when we replaced the filter with the new one, the fridge did not sense a new filter was in there, maybe my husband is supposed to reset a button on the fridge which he didn't do so we still have our filter alarm light on even with the filter. Not sure if that's user error or something wrong with the filter. Otherwise we were happy with the purchase"
I always purchase these on Amazon. Can’t beat the price!
"I purchased this filter for my 4 French door Samsung refrigerator model RF4289HARS. Installation is really quick, you just have to unscrew the old one about a half a turn to the left and it comes right out and install the new one with half a turn to the right. Then run about a gallon of water out of the water dispenser in the door to remove any air from the line, and finally press  and hold the filter reset/ child lock button on the front of the display for about 3-5 seconds and you're done!"
The refrigerator water filter was real easy to install and the price was great.
"this filtered is total garbage. it appears to be genuine but that's not a good thing. other non-samsung filters i used before reduced the ppm to 400. on top of it not working, amazon charges for the return of this so i addume not a prodict amazon sells directly despite showing as prime"
Needed a filter. So i got a filter :)
I read a lot of reviews before purchasing a replacement for my new Samsung French Door refrigerator. Several of the reviews stated that off brand filters eventually caused problem leaks. Some stated no problems at all. My old frig had a constant water leak I had to deal with. I personally didn't want to take a chance on having any problems with water leaks again and bought the name brand filter. I did find that the filter is cheaper on Amazon than at the home repair stores. It's always in stock and two day delivery with Amazon Prime.
Fit is good but Samsung needs to make it easier to install new filters. This filter is great the refrigerator is the problem. The filter works very well! I will purchase this filter again. Fast shipping great seller!
This fits my Samsung refrigerator perfectly. I change it every 6 months.
"I'm not big on replacing filters very often. Whether it is a refrigerator, vacuum, or furnace. It just feels like I'm getting ripped off for a perceived maintenance item. I bought this Samsung water filter through Amazon for about $30 instead of $50 plus. It's worked out fine. It lasts for about six months. I take it out and put it back in for another six months. I don't taste any difference and the refrigerator is tricked and shows as a new filter.Rating: 4 out of 5 stars for not lasting very long (if you follow the instructions) and the cost."
"OK, sure there are some 'knock-off' filters for my fridge that cost less. But for a $2000 refer/freezer, I'm not going to take a chance (per some of those reviews) with them - I will always get the genuine Samsung ones. They are easy to replace and I've had zero issues with them! This is my 2nd time of ordering them and I plan to continue doing so on Amazon."
"I should have known right away that something wasn't right when there was not an authenticator strip in the box. About 30 days after install water started tasting different and filter clearly was not working. I've bought several others though autoship and no issues, but will buy elsewhere going forward. It may cost more, but at least I won't have to worry about knock offs."
Easy to install.
"These are the real deal - they meet both sets of ANSI/NSF standards (42 and 53) where many of the lower priced competitors only meet NSF 42, which is the taste and color specification, not the water purification and contaminant elimination (health related) specification.They fit as they are designed by the manufacturer to work in Samsung refrigerators.Saving money may not be in your best interests.  Sometimes you do get what you pay for."
"This filter does eliminate odor and taste from the water, no question. However, it does not last for 6 months, and depending on the use, not even 4 months. The flow of water starts to decrease until eventually it stops. We are a family of 5 drinking the water. Maybe it is the quality of the water, but I was disappointed to find out that I have to change the filter more often, and spend more money to have good tasting water. This is the recommended model and brand for my Samsung refrigerator so there is not much I can do. I have already asked Samsung about this, but they don't think the refrigerator is defective."
The first water through had a taste to it. But I then ran 6 pitchers of water through it and tossed all the ice and after that the water tasted fine
They are very easy to install and the water taste awesome...Getting them from Amazon is a cheaper price also
Perfect fit. Good value. Easy to use and effective.
It fits our Samsung fridge very well and no water leaking... Its great quality and water taste very good. I change mine every 6 month with Samsung brand.
Arrives on time and works well
This is the real deal - genuine. Do not be fooled by cheap replacements. I just was and had to return them. I bought a much cheaper 3 pack and the water quality was awful and I felt like the filter was going to break my fridge when installing it ( I am glad it did not). Its not worth trying to save a few bucks - go with genuine Samsung. The water tastes clean and clear.
"Happy to find this on Amazon slightly cheaper than my local appliance store (and easier with free shipping).  Easy to replace ... wasn't positive that my filter needed replacing on my Samsung side-by-side, but the side of the filter box tells you that the filter indicator on the fridge (normally blue), turns red when it needs replacing.  So I waited a few weeks to actually replace the filter, and sure enough, the indicator did eventually turn kind of red.  The box mentioned that it might be difficult to replace without turning off the water supply, so I had my husband change it out.  He had to turn the old filter fairly hard to get it out, but it came out (and new one went in) without having to turn off the water supply. Overall, very happy with the purchase."
"Don't try and save money with cheaper non Samsung brand filters.  Did that, won't make that mistake twice.  Other brands leaked and only lasted 4-6 weeks before they were plugged.  This filter worked as it should and water quality is super.  Also, filter is still allowing same flow as it did when I put it in (1 month ago).  No issues there.  Only issue is price.  Samsung filters are a lot more expensive than generic brands.  But I have never had one fail or leak.  Save money and buy the three pack."
"The image in the product listing shows filter with model code HAF-QIN/EXP.  However, the filter I received is HAF-CIN/EXP model. Very disappointed."
"There was an odorless, transparent vaseline-like goo under the cap, and on the tip of product.  Did not use."
best price and delivered just in time
Satisfied with the purchase!
"As much as I'm not a fan of the price of this filter, when compared to the non-name brand filters, but I think you have to spend the extra money for this filter. We have tried non-Samsung filters and the water quality is awful. The water tastes like plastic and you can just tell that the quality is not as good. Samsung filters are for Samsung products, there's no two ways about it. Buy it! It's a purchase worth making if you have the compatible fridge."
"I've read other reviews and took a gamble on this. When I originally bought my Samsung french door fridge, I had gotten 2 free filters from the retailer. The original filter lasted be about 8 months which I think is the original design as from what others have posted. I had gotten about a month out of each filter and I am on my 4th one from Amazon. I have city water (southern NY) in which the water come from the Catskill Mountains, best water so I am not sure how these filters barely last me a month. The filter reset on my fridge does not come on and the water trickles out. I ran it without the filter and the flow is super strong without it. I contacted Samsung and talking to their customer support is like talking to a wall. I will try to purchase a filter other than Amazon. I am not knocking Amazon, but from other reviews it looks like it's either a bad batch or fake filters. Also I am going to purchase an in-line filter so I have two filters. Filter says it is good for 6 months or 300 gallons. There is no way my city water clogs my filter with 300 gallons in less than a month."
"No funny taste , after you drink the water. Through don't feel dry and itchy . Great replacement for bottle water. 👏👏👏"
"After almost a month of seeing ""REPLACE FILTER"" every time I looked at the fridge, my mom bequeathed the responsibility to me, telling me to go to Sears. I went there and asked someone for help. Spent about an hour or so with the Sears worker trying to help me figure out the fridge fix, but I ended up leaving the store empty handed.That night I googled ""samsung fridge filter"". Lo and behold, this was one of the first hits that popped up. Yay, it fits in our fridge!Suitable for Model RF32MQDB (what we have)."
"Good flow, good taste, used these for a few years and have always been happy with them."
Came with a verification process to make sure its genuine samsung product.  great as usual.
We bought some of the cheaper replacements for our Samsung fridge and didn't relate them to our ice maker not working.  I thought it was the fridge that was bad and the ice-maker that went out but I read a few reviews about the replacement filters and tried to go back to the original filter and our ice-maker started working right away.  Well worth the extra money.
As with any OEM replacement the prices are very high
It is what the manufacturer wants you to use and it works perfectly. When we first bought the fridge from Home Depot they did not sell the Samsung brand filter so I bought their universal brand and it screwed up and we had to have the whole water and ice dispenser system replaced under Home Depot's warranty. The same thing happened to my son as he bought the same model as we did. So is it a fault of the universal filter or the Samsung fridge?
Basically a standard filter for my Samsung fridge.  It works fine and is easy to install
We have been buying this for years and love saving money by purchasing through Amazon.
It works.
"If you are like me, I was confused as to which Samsung water filter would fit my Samsung refrigerator. The information in the manual and on the Amazon website was not clear. Which one? Here is what I found on the Samsung parts website. Evidently this water filter brand # fits a variety of Samsung model numbers. Hopefully you can find your model number in the attached list."
"This filter lasted for about 7 months. It's easy to install, however i recommend using a plier to twist it unlock/lock."
Bueno me gusto 👍🏻
Easier and cheaper to order on Amazon than try and find one at the store. Great price too.
I love the Samsung water filters and refuse to use any other brand. Never have I had a problem with them and will not risk other brands in my Samsung refrigerator.
"This was the second or third time I purchased filters from Amazon.  I bought a two pack at a much better price than buying at Lowe's where we bought the Samsung refrigerator. The last filter had to be replaced a month sooner and we have a whole house water filter so that was a little disappointing.  I just checked current prices of this filter on Amazon and found them to be significantly cheaper than what I paid in August. But, the bottom line is they were still cheaper than buying them from the store and it's something the refrigerator needs if you are using the water/ice maker."
After paying $400 to repair my Samsung refrigerator these damaged my water filter area.  They are just a bit off which caused my water dispenser to flow without stopping.  Water everywhere and the repair tech told me that this was the cause.  It happened right after I inserted the new filter.  Go with the Samsung brand don't use these.  Can't return them.
"I religiously change my water filter every 6 months and the filter preserves the life of the water dispensing component for my fridge.  Also, a great price and fast shipping.  Thank you."
Expensive but it works fine.
"This is much more expensive than the same ones from Samsung I bought last year (I think almost 15 bucks more) but for now I want the OEM and a peace of mind knowing this. I certainly do not trust the ones made in China although they are much more cheaper, but you get what you pay for. If Samsung keeps raising their cost for their filters I'll look for my next replacements elsewhere but it'll have to be made in America."
I stick with the brand even though it costs more than a generic substitute. The items arrived in good condition and with plenty of “use by” months.
"Tried a cheap knock-off at first and it leaked after 3 days and the water was still cloudy after dumping about 10 gallons. These filters work very well and if you purchase knock-offs at a better price make sure they're NSF certified. They cost a little more, but at least I know what I'm getting - NSF certified and high grade carbon rather than charcoal powder or worse."
Quick delivery and easy installation
I've ordered these before.  They work great!  Easy to install.
"Been using a Home Depot version of a water filter but it was recommended to change after 6 months so I decided to go with this one. It works fine but after I remove it from the lever, there's 3 drops that follows each time."
"This item was an exact match to the factory installed original.  No need to shut off the water.  Just unscrew the old one and install the new one.  We don't use much ice or cold water, so we waited 12 months to change filters.  I cut open the used one and found a solid carbon sleeve inside a thick wall PVC shell.  No way to determine if it was ""used up"" or how much life it had remaining.  I have a photo but can't find a way to post it."
"I've purchased this twice.  The first product worked great (5 star).The second purchase would be okay (3 star).  While it seems to work,  I won't buy again.  Once installed, I can't get my ""water"" light to go off (keeps reminding me to change the filter, even though I did with this one).  I've unplugged my fridge, and restarted.  I've taken the filter and re-installed twice.  Nothing works.Great price though!"
I use my water and ice daily on my fridge so replace the filter as needed.  Great way to get it fast on Amazon.
Great
Very convenient to order these online. They are very easy to install and last a long time.
Fit perfectly as described for the Samsung Refrigerator we own.
These filters are plastic and they ask you to replace every 6 months. But why don’t they come with an address label to return for recycling?
Very capable filter and able to remove many impurities from a very hard water source.  Tastes wonderful and saves from buying bottled water.
"Product arrived as promised. Replacing the filter was a breeze. Had to unlock the existing filter, remove it, insert the new one and lock it. I did not have to turn off the water supply. Also when I removed the old filter a few drops of water trickled out but otherwise there was no other flow. After replacing the filter I did not observe any water leaks. We have to manually reset the red filter warning indication on the fridge. After putting in the new filter I did not notice any discoloration."
Before you just put it in and read the directions. There is a magnetic square that you have to rub on the cylinder so that it removes the red light Notification on the front of the Refrigerator.
It was a perfect fit easy to install 👌
"It fits my refrigerator very well, but the water coming out has a smell until long time."
"less expensive options out there but I would always wonder about filtering effectiveness and whether they would leak when I was not at home. Samsung branded and cheaper than at bestbuy,"
It fits perfectly w/o any leaks and it was a decent price.
I like getting OEM. The filter does what I need it to. I change it every year to have good flow and taste.
"The filter arrived quickly. I was concerned due to other reviews I had read; but the filter was new, still in original packaging, including the shrink-wrap plastic.  The pricing was great; much better than local stores.One item to note which others have pointed out: for some odd reason, the per-filter price of the filters is better when you buy a single one than if you go with the two or three pack. In other words, if have have a need of multiple filters, purchase multiple of the single packs - the combined price will be less than the two or three pack. (at least, that was the case at the time of purchase and time of this review)."
Always go with the OEM product. I have tried filters from third-party sellers and they either cause too much of a mess through delivery or leave a sour taste in the ice/water.
Will b ordering more
Be careful you are choosing the right filter size before you purchase it
I like how easy it is to install. The filter serves the purpose to get rid of the solids on my water.
Just follow the instructions and the installation will be faultless.
"The local store wanted about 50.00 for this item, but amazon had a better deal, I will do it again"
This product was super easy to install.  Great value!
works nice and easy to install
"This filter not only filtered the water well, it turns the water into wine and turns out fridge into a wine dispenser. I gotta say, didn’t know Jesus lived in water filter, he truly works I’m mysterious ways. Thank you Jesus, thank you."
I have this product on my Subscribe and save through amazon and they are delivered every 6 months to my door. My water is always fresh and drinkable. It’s easy to install with a pair of pliers. Takes about 5 minutes to install. I run about 5 gallons of water through it then I’m good to go.
It's a water filter and it is not a fake
"Fit was perfect. I initially had an issue with it not seating all the way, causing water to leak into the refrigerator. I ended up pulling the fridge forward and turned off the water source. I discharged the line and was easily able to insert and twist the filter into place. I turned the water back on, flushed the filter and have not had an issue since. The inlet on the filter was the same size as the one I was replacing. It is cheaper purchasing on Amazon than from Best Buy or Lowes."
"Item received was not the SAME as advertised online on the Amazon!Product code appears to be the same but;1. Package DO NOT have the 'NSF/ANSI 53 Certified' Gold Mark as it appears on online page!2. Filter inside do not list 'Lead/Mercury' as listed online!Filter I received is Made in Mexico.It seems to me that ONLY the HAF-CIN/EXP filter batches made in Korea under 'Genuine Samsung' label carry the NSF/ANSI 53 gold certification, as those batches may have been actually tested and approved. Others just say 'confirmed to' notification.Those are available at local Lowes or Home Depot for ~$50+tax. I was ordering something else from Amazon and thought to add this as it appeared this to be the same but........it seems these are nothing short of those cheap knock offs available from others for around $10-20!If you want to make sure these confirms to NSF/ANSI 53, especially for Lead/Mercury, look for 'gold-certified' label and those genuine Samsung 'Made in Korea'Item is going out the door as a return.....Disappointed!!"
"WHY are these so darn expensive?! Over $30 for a filter!So, I had a busy 90 days. I traveled a bit for work, then took a long holiday. I wasn't home for most of that 90 days, and barely used the water via my Samsung refrigerator during that period. Yet - after 90 days, the light indicated that I should replace the filter, because samsungwantallyourmoneyandthisiseasywaytokeepgettingit. So I resisted the urge to punch my stainless-steel fridge, and instead held down the ""light"" button to reset the filter warning.Since I always buy these via amazon, I can just look at my purchase history to see how long it's been & replace on my own cycle. I still think they are price gouging just because I bought the refrigerator during a labor day sale. BUT HOW DID THEY KNOW?!"
"Since our water is already charcoal treated for the entire house this is not really necessary, but you can't have the water dispenser and ice maker work without it. Rather than change the filter every time the fridge complains I change it every other. Having double filtered water can't hurt I suppose."
Great Value .
Same product you find at lowes or home depot. Noticible difference in taste of water once installed new
"Product works as expected.  Only thing that would be nice is either (1) it last longer or (2) it's able to determine when expires not just by date but by usage.  I don't drink a huge amount of water/use a large amount of ice, so I think it should last longer, but no way to tell (this is likely more of a fridge issue than filter issue, but as the two go hand-in-hand, I am recording it here."
It is the cheapest one. I compare bestbuy and Home Depot  It’s worth to buy when u need it
"After checking the owners manual, this was the appropriate replacement required for my appliance.  Happy that it worked out!"
"Perfect replacement, identical to original filter supplied with new refrigerator. Simple Instalation zero water dripped on replacement when water valve turned off."
"The price for a multi-pack was better than what I pay at Home Depot or Lowe's, but the item I was sent was not the correct SKU so it would not work in my refrigerator. Very confusing listing because it has the correct model #, but some of the images show different models."
This is an OE replacement water filter for my Samsung double door refrigerator.  I previously purchased an off brand because I was able to get two filters for about the same price as one brand name filter.  After using this other brand of filter for a couple of months I could smell and taste chlorine and the rate altogether just wasn't too good.  So when I received this new Samsung filter (which I believe is made by 3M) and installed it and ran the required amount of water through it (at least 3 gallons) and could immediately tell the difference in smell and taste... so much better.
"We purchased a home, and the first thing our real estate agent said to do was ""change the filters"".  I ordered these on Amazon, as an OEM replacement at it was delivered promptly.  It only took a minute to change and flush before drinking crisp filtered water."
"Quick delivery, easy installation"
Great buy!!
They are what they are supposed to be. Little spendy but nothing cheaper if you want the good one.
Great price for genuine part!
Perfect fit to replace our filter.
I hope it filters the ice cube water. How would I know?  Ok to put in once I can get the cap off.  What I like is the it really doesn't drip alot of water at bottom of frig towards the end of it life.
Very expensive but we had lots of trouble with off market brands. Keeps our water flowing!
Hard to get in and only lasts 6 months. Expensive
It was a product needed for my refrigerator filter system.  I don't have any othets to compare with.  The first tine I order I was able to install without issue.  This one took a little effort.
"I see mixed reviews here, so I made sure the one I bought is sold and shipped by Amazon. It had the authenticity checker included in the box. Fits perfectly on my fridge, and water tastes good."
"This filter has been great in our refrigerator, of course it is the Samsung factory recommended one.  I would give it 5 Stars for functionality BUT 2 Stars for cost.  Every time I order one the price seems to increase, this time substantially! How do you justify increasing your filter from $30.00 to $49.00 in less than a year?  That is a 30% increase!"
"I had no choice on the specific filter for my refrigerator and tried obtaining it from the store where I bought the refrigerator.they advised it was not in stock and would call me when it  was available. I decided to try Amazon for the first time in my life.not only was it in stock at Amazon but it was in varied quantities (Cost Savings),  Free  Shipping (Cost Savings)  and  I had it  inhome in 2 days.  No gas wasted  to get it from the store.The store called almost 2 weeks later  to advise they had  the  filters available."
Perfect fit and real genuine samsung product
Item is just what I needed.  Easy installation and fits fine.  I would like to see another picture without the cap on it.  Some filters have one rubber ring and some have two.  I looked at a few before I found the right one with two rings.  Would have been helpful to have a picture showing the two rings.
"Decided to go with the Samsung product, which is NSF 53 certified, whereas the others, even though they are priced lower, have a lower number of certification.  We did turn the fridge water line off to switch it out - otherwise the pressure makes it hard to get the new one locked back in and then you do have to run the water for awhile (7 water pitchers worth) to get the water tasting normal.  There was also some black stuff in the first pitcher."
not two easy to install in my samsun ref.
Easy to install.
"Fue una buena inversión, son los filtros originales por lo que la calidad está asegurada."
"I had previously bought an off brand version of this product and while I was happy the product I am way happier with this one. While using the other product, the water flow was very low. The water seemed like it was trickling out. After replacing the old with this one, the water flows way better and fills my glass way faster. I liked that the product was delivered the day after I order it. Thank you Amazon."
"Easy, convenient just as expected."
Seems to be working well for our Samsung refrigerator.  Just need to run water thru it for awhile when it's first installed.
"To be honest, I am not a chemist.  Nor have I submitted a 'before and after' sample to a lab for analysis.  As far as we can tell, it is doing its job.  But the price of this filter for the short period of time it works is shockingly high!  Our Samsung refrigerator has an indicator that comes on based on time installed OR degree of clogging from filtering.  So far the filter has never been clogged.  In fact, we wonder if the filtering is actually 'used up' --- in other words, if it could go longer before being replaced.  Other than the cost, and wondering if its efficiency is really expired, it is easy to install.  I gave it a ""3"" because of price and because you don't know if it was really used up and wonder if we are therefore wasting money and resources."
"Good replacement filter, and easy to install!"
Great
Filter is good once it has had a bunch of water run through it.  A bunch is as much as two gallons that is thrown away.  The carbon must come loose in the filter and is flushed out.
"I've purchased 3 pack bundle. Replaced one and noticed the water flow to be very weak and slow. I thought there was a problem with the refrigerator's connector part so I just bear with it. By the time it required a new filter, I replaced it and this time water flow was nice and strong. It was the filter's problem, not the refrigerator and you don't really know if the next filter is defective or not until it's time to open it and by then it may to too late to return it. So I decided to purchase one at a time from next time.I didn't have a problem with water quality, however.*"
"The product was an authentic Samsung product and even had an authentication tag magnet to prove it was authentic. It LITERALLY took me about 5 seconds to replace the filter, could not have been any easier. Highly recommend!"
"The filter is a pain to get out and I've hurt my fingers more than once trying to remove the old filter.  The removal caused pain in my knuckles for about a week because I couldn't get it to twist.  Next time I buy a fridge, I will definitely pay more attention to how the filters are installed, however it works to filter the water."
"We have bought probably 2 dozen of the Samsung DA29-00020B-1P filters for our Samsung frig.  Most recently I have had to return 3 because the new filter will not flow water at all or will at a trickle. I usually keep an extra filter, and the spare works great.  If I put the new filter back in: no water.  The QA at manufacturing is not checking for flow rate, flaws, etc.  This is a very expensive filter and should provide premium performance. When the filter works it provides great tasting water.  However, I will have to look at the third party brands for the next filter replacement."
It’s the same filter. I always find it for some reason hard to pull these out of the frig but putting them back is a little easier.
Too expensive for a water filter
"Great filters certified to NFS/ANSI 53... to remove lead, mercury and more. IF the ones you receive are Not counterfeits! Unfortunately with filters, all you have to rely on that they will really work, is getting real product and trust. I've ordered these 3 times from Amazon over the last 3+ years. The first 2 times I'm pretty sure I got genuine Samsung tested and certified filters. But on my last order, in May of 2018, I received likely counterfeits, which I just returned (thank you Amazon): These latest filters were missing lot numbers, had disclaimers on the labels about not being tested by NFS or ANSI, and the product pamphlet was missing certifications among others. I contacted Samsung and looked at the same product they listed on their site which confirmed these were likely counterfeits.  Then, today, I just received product directly from OEM mfg at slightly less cost (with subscription service where you can set frequency and it had no charge shipping). The product I just received from OEM had lot numbers, certification that it was tested by NFS/ANSI to 42, 53, and 401 standards, had copies of certificated from state of CA on its pamphlet and all the hall marks of being genuine. Amazon is so convenient that it was a big disappointment to find as others have found on this item that they are likely not genuine filters."
"This filter is NOT worth the price asked. I ordered a replacement, and after installing it I dissected the original filter that came with our fridge. The attached images show how the filter is constructed. It is a simple activated charcoal cylinder with some very basic o-ring sealing, worth probably around $10 max. I estimate that about 65-85% of the cost of the filter is just profit.Many companies play the same kind of pricing games for ongoing items, but I think it's deceptive, dishonest, and creates poor incentives for properly maintaining the appliance (which they probably want so they don't have to honor warranty claims). I despise these kinds of business practices, and refuse to cooperate.Additionally, the 6 month replacement period is ridiculous unless your water supply is exceptionally contaminated. We are on well water and the only thing which needs to be removed is sediment (which is taken care of by a different filter system). The filter I dissected was used for 22 months, and based on what I found within I will now only be replacing the filter every 5 years or so.Maybe others are happy to pay out the nose for very basic filtration, but I am not."
"Does the job but only lasts average of 2 months.States it should last 6 months,1 filter.Never does it last that long.Same with no frills filters."
Samsung water filter are the best and work better. Easy to install.
Easy to install . And just like that product
The first 2 worked fine. Put the 3rd one in this week and had water leaking into my drawer. Had to run out to Lowes to buy a new one that is working.  Will not buy from here again.
"Several reviewers mentioned that these filters are different from previous ones, but mine are the same OEM filters that match the current filter in my Samsung fridge now.  You save a lot buying three in a package, and you don't need to change them as frequently as the manual recommends.  I change mine when the flow decreases or 1 year later, depending upon which comes first.  You save a lot on filter costs using Amazon.com!"
"Not a lot to say except, yes, this filter fits our new fridge perfectly, the price for the 3-pack was great, and as usual, shipping from Amazon was unbeatably fast and reliable!  As some other reviewers have mentioned, the flow of the water was, at first, a bit slower right after I changed the filter, but after just a week or so, the strength of the flow returned to normal.  I think it just needed a little time to ""settle in"" and fill up.  I would definitely buy these again here!"
"I have a recent filter purchased directly from Samsung.  Comparing it with this filter from Amazon, the Amazon filter appears to be a genuine Samsung filter -- at 2/3's the price of the Samsung-direct filter"
I have it on auto delivery.  Love it.
"We've tried cheaper water filters and none we've tried were worth the trouble. This is the case where you want to pony up more than you'd like to pay and get something you'll enjoy. Going with Samsung original equipment, or water filters in this case, is the only way to go."
"You can't expect a whole lot from a little refrigerator filter. This one does a good job of removing most the chlorine in the water. My area has some pretty bad water and it knocks off the bad taste by more than half. Water still tastes funny, but not as bad as my tap water. I just tested my filter at end of life and it still knocks down the Total Dissolved Solids from 550 to 450. Can't say the price is great for these little filters, but I can't really blame the manufactures for charging so much either."
"I am now ordering my 4th filter and have had zero issues. There are a couple tips that will help if you are having issues getting water through the filter.1. Have a towel below the filter before removal for any small leaks.2. Make sure to apply even pressure before locking the filter. It requires a bit more then just sliding in.That is it, really it is quite easy :)."
"This is the second water filter, purchased at Amazon, I've replaced in my Samsung fridge.  I stuck with the name brand to be safe and the only thing I know for certain is this: When I didn't change the filter as required, the water line eventually clogged and no ice was made.  I'd have to clear the line to get it going again. When the filter is changed about every 6 to 8 months, no problems of that sort.  The water in our area does not taste like minerals - it's more like bottled water - so the taste is the same either way.  And Amazon, as usual, has a very good price for these filters."
Easy to install.  Good price.
It is easy to install and exactly as advertised.  Will purchase again from this vendor.
Very easy to install and genuine part.
There just is no good reason for this filter to come $50.  I have moved on to an after market brand and I am completely satisfied.  I can tell absolutely no difference in performance and  get three filters for less  than i paid at Best Buy for this one Samsung brand filter.
This is the brand name filter for my refrigerator.  I have used generic products before and they are definitely not the same quality.  It is worth paying a little more for the brand name product.
"While some may say that paying for the original manufacturer filters is too expensive, look at how much you spent on that shiny new Samsung fridge.  Keep it running at peak efficiency with an OE filter."
"I purchased a two different Samsung filter models for a couple of Samsung refrigerators where I had installed HD HDX filters.  The HDX filters produced, best as I can describe, a chemical or plastic taste and odor.  The Samsung replacements do not have this problem.  Side note... I noticed the amazon product description states China.  Both models I purchased were made in Mexico."
"First, always buy something as important like this when it is “Sold by Amazon” to avoid getting fakes or ones that do not meet advertised specifications. I have always done this over the years and have been very happy with what I’ve received.This filter fits perfectly, works well, and doesn’t leak. The quality of the water is noticeably better after swapping out a filter, so it’s obviously doing something!"
Seems to work well.  Had some issues at first but found the button on the ice cube tray...once pushing that in and getting some water through the filter it began to make ice.  I only have the ice dispenser so it was a little more difficult to figure out how to get it working again once the filter was replaced.
It’s original OEM filter. What’s not to like. You get what you pay for. I’ve tried others like HD filters. Horrible taste. You get what you pay for. Buy it.
This product fit perfectly without any leaks.  The flavor has no funny taste or odor
"These were definitely the official filters.  I used the pictures in other comments here to compare these to what I purchased at Home Depot a year ago, and discovered that one was a knock-off.  It had the fine print ""this is not NSF certified"" whereas these ones from Amazon do not have that line.  The one from Home Depot also had only one rubber washer around the neck, where these had two."
Fit perfectly and appears to be a factory direct replacement. Follow the instructions to run about a gallon of water continuously from the door to purge the air out of the system. Failure to do so will result in small amount of water dribbling out of the spigot when not in use. Not a glass at a time but a full pitcher worth at once.
"Works very well at removing chlorine smell and taste.  They also now have an even higher certification for removing other things.  I have no means of testing that, so I'll trust that the appropriate government agency is doing their job (probably a bad idea, I know).  Anyway, fits my fridge perfectly, easy to install and remove, no leaks, and the water flow is fine."
👍🏻
Great filter and easy to install. I never have to turn off the water valve.
Exactly what was needed. Easy to install.
OEM Filter good value. Product exactly as advertised
Works as expectedEasy to installPriced better than other online filter sites & definitely better than retail stores
Good product. Easy installation. Happy with purchase and transaction.
"I just received the new filter. However, the design of labels for the box and the filter was different.  Even Samsung site have not updated there pictures. But going be review and new Samsung Logo. I am trying out this new filter. So far. It is working. Will see house ice comes out."
It's a great product. Value for money is bad. Haven't actually tasted it yet but iv bought these in the past.
"16 ounces in 18 seconds.  Much better flow rate than off-brand, so called compatible filters.  Cost effective compared to off-brand filters when considering 66% failure rate (paid for 3 off-brand filters, 1 worked (.3 gal/min) 2 were so slow I discarded them after 1 day's use.)  For best results use Samsung parts."
Oem
"I guess the first option one has is to go either with a generic or the brand name.  I guess the generics fit and probably filter as well as the brand name but saving customers money.  I guess for my household, we are very happy and content with our $2k ""Sammy"" french door/freezer drawer fridge thus far and would not want to add any unnecessary ""variables"" into the mix, yet.  At $30 per filter, we can still do the brand name, *sigh*.BTW, the removal and replacement is super easy!  The only thing (though I guess not absolutely necessary) is the time it takes to flush approx 3 gallons of water through the new unit, *sigh*."
The perfect fit
Very good item and a very good seller
Price was excellent. Could not find this locally.
"Goldilocks: Not to thick, not to thin, they are just right.I wanted hangers that would not bend under the weight of wet pants while the hung dry: Check.I wanted hangers which were not to thick, clogging my closet: Check.Made in USA - Bonus.Buy these! I am very happy that I did..."
Works great. Light inside refrigerator is gone and my water is awsome!
So far it works great on my refrigerator.
This fits. Others may or may not.
It’s a filter. What more can I say?
"This was the perfect replacement for an old samsung filter that we had in our fridge. It was easy to replace (just unscrew the old and screw in the new) and created fresh, clean tasting water immediately (after running the recommended 10 gallons through the filter). I'm very glad I got the 2 pack to be prepared for the next time I need to replace the filter."
It's a water filter for our refrigerator
This Samsung water filter was exact fit for my Samsung refrigerator as stated by the supplier.Product delivered on time. Replacement of filter was very simple and easy (you can check it on You Tube). Water quality is very good that satisfies my expectation.
"After replace the new one,water drop much faster then old one,hope this one can use 6 months."
Fits easy to install works well
Perfect filter for the job!
I live in a town where the water company supplies well water so a filter is a must.  In two years time they are converting to lake water.  This filter retails for $55 and sells here for $36.  Great deal -- NO.  I found one recommended by Amazon (after  the Samsung was delivered) for $18.99 made by Waterfall Filter Company and one for $13.99 made by Refresh.  Both of these third party filters have excellent reviews.
I use this one every time I change the filter.  First time I tried using an aftermarket filter and it leaked water.  Every time since then I’ve used this OEM Samsung filter and no problems at all.
"I really would like to save money with 3rd-party versions of these filters, but the reviews often mention leaks which would ruin my wood floor... so I pay up for the name-brand.Wish they lasted longer. Otherwise, they work fine."
very good value for your money! I love buying them 3 at a time because they last me a year after installing the first one! no need to worry about ordering before the red light comes on in my fridge!!
More expensive than the off brands but it works and tastes great. No leaks.
I tried off brands and they either leak or didn't last.  This one works great!  Worth the price.
"This review marks the second time we bought filters that give off a nasty fishy taste to the water (Note: we’ve purchased 8 “Genuine Samsung filters” from Amazon to date). It is my understanding that some water filters have an anion exchange resin that can release low levels of trimethylamine, which isn’t dangerous at low levels, but tastes horrible (like dead fish). Amazon refunded me the first time this happened, and again this time. However, there was some push-back from Samsung (mediated by an Amazon rep) who claimed they have never heard of this issue. I found evidence of others with this same issue within 10 seconds in a google search, so that is doubtful from Samsung and certainly doesn’t reflect well on their customer service or quality of their product. Thank you to Amazon for making it right for me."
Works great and easy to install.
Fresh  water and value
I've bought two of these since getting our new fridge and they work great. We have well water and this filters perfectly.
"Great filter, good price - Although price is not as low as I would like, I believe that purchasing a reputable filter is paramount.  We have used others that made the water smell like fish or something after only a month of use - look, if you are concerned enough to purchase a filter for your drinking need, care enough to get one that will do the job - not one that's a knock off.  We will look for better prices on the Samsung filters - overall very happy and content with the filter"
I have a Samsung fridge.  I have been using the compatible Whirlpool filters since it was new and always struggled with water flow.  I tried these replacement Samsung filters and that problem has gone away.
"What can you say about water filter for your fridge other than it either works great or it sucks, right?  I mean, it ain't pretty.  There are no moving parts to watch in wonder.  But as far as doing what it says it does and being sold at a great price this filter and this price is top notch!  I replace mine every six months like clock-work and my fridge water tastes GREAT!  No after tastes.  No funny smells.  Just great tasting water!"
"Found this info elsewhere, as I was looking for this info, maybe others are too!The Samsung DA29-00020B filter reduces the following contaminants:- Asbestos- Benzene- Chlorine Taste & Odor- Cysts- Lead- Particulates (Class I)- Sand- Dirt- Rust- Silt- Limescale- Turbidity- Atrazine- LindaneNOTE: this filter does not reduce fluorideSamsung DA2900020B / Samsung HAFCIN Refrigerator Filter specifications:- Flow Rate: Approx. 0.75 GPM- Micron Rating: 0.5 microns- Function: Chemical/Mechanical- Capacity: 300 Gallons or 6 months- Dimensions: 8 7/8"" x 2"" (9.25"" without tip)- Operating Temperature: Min. 34 F; Max. 100 F- Operating Pressure: Min. 30 PSI; Max. 125 PSI"
Came as pictured and was on sale so i saved alot buying it on here! Exactly what i needed!!
"I like the product. Far superior to the ""compatible with"" filters. These don't leak at all. So, why only 4 stars? Well, have you looked at the price of this item? Samsung really reams it to you for this, but it's the way to go."
"We got these for our brand new Samsung fridge. It's easy to install, and last a long time. I paid the full amount for the brand name filters because I don't mess with my family's drinking water. The only other annoying thing, like with every filter, is you have to run and dump a ton of water which gets pretty tedious."
"This was easy to install and fit in our Samsung fridge. It lasts us about 4-5 months with regular use of two adults. I was not entirely impressed with the taste of the water, it tasted slightly like dirt. Prior to purchasing this refrigerator, we used Brita and Zero Water pitchers and liked the taste of those, although you cannot beat the convenience of just pushing the lever on the door of the fridge with your cup and getting cold water. Before, we had to open the fridge, pour the water out and put the pitcher back inside. We also had to refill the pitchers when the water level got low. Although this water isn't the best tasting, I am lazy and will drink it over filling the pitcher, so I guess it is good enough =)."
"My whole family loves these bottles. They are so well made!  We fill almost to top with filtered water & keep in freezer.Then when ready to drink, flip lid up & fill to top with more filtered water.. They come in larger size ,too, so whatever you prefer.They are spill-proof & just the BEST !!! Fit in auto drink holder & also I take to work with me every day so no spills around desk/computer area... Buy them ""please"", so they never stop making or selling them.. I keep 4-5 new spares in pantry 'JUST IN CASE"".I give them 5 stars cuz they are that good! P.S. Don't buy the ones with straws built in , not so good at all.."
Fits perfect on a Samsung fridge!
The brand name works so no worries about leakage or obstruction.
It was a perfect fit and easy to install
Great value
"Very easy to use and replace. Works as expected. paid high price for samsung branded filter as compared to third party versions, I do not want to take chances with my families drinking health and my expensive refrigerator, it's a once in 6 month expense and I prefer buying original one from Samsung. Replaced easily and drained out for around 3 gallons before using first time, and works flawlessly. Water tastes noticeably better with new filter."
Works great
Great price! Works well!
The filter is faulty. Not working.
"i have had no leaks or problems with this cartridge.  i have not tried an off brand as i have not wanted to have a possible problem.  also, the frig is in warranty yet and i want to be sure there is no question of using an after market filter."
Easy to install.
"Our filter expired and we needed a new one. I must admit that we purchased, what was suppose to be, a compatible brand from a local store that listed the same model number, etc. However, that was a huge mistake; water everywhere. We turned around and ordered the oem product and will never purchase another off brand filter. Samsung even states on their website, that they do not offer support for non oem filters, as they don't always fit correctly and can cause issues. Yes, now I know. Thank goodness this set is affordable and is an oem."
"Filter fits, doesn't leak, so Good.But not a good value, as price of filter is too high, and Samsung wants you to replace it every 6 months (vice 12).  I suspect shorter time interval is for a continuing revenue stream, as ink-jet printer manufacturers have done.  Given physical size of filter compared to previous filters of similar technology, 6 months is too short a time interval for replacement."
Ease of installation and effectiveness much better than the discounted ones.
It works very well
I went to the local blue hardware store a couple of times to never find this water filter in stock at the store. The last time I went in the store another customer was looking at appliances and they noticed I was bummed about not getting a filter again. They said they had saved alot of money but just ordering them off Amazon and they were right. I compared the online prices and it was a great deal. I will definitely be a repeat buyer.
Excellent product
"Works great, looks  legit, comes with  double ring as shown in pic, unlike the last batch i bought."
"There's not much to review with respect to this filter.  Its the ""official"" Samsung filter for my refrigerator model, and it arrived, fit, and was easy to install.  I didn't have my water tested before and after, so I can't say how well it works, but it seems to do fine..  I think its a little overpriced, but when you buy a new fridge, you know what you're getting in to, and the fridge itself is great, so needing a new expensive filter occasionally isn't the end of the world."
Works perfectly
Quick delivery as seen as advertised
Water started to taste more filtered. It might be my fridge but my ice has an odd plastic taste
"Everything was perfect , as always Amazon !!!"
There were 2 cartridges in our order. Used the 1st one and went in without any problem. We needed to change the cartridge yesterday and the second one will not screw into the cartridge compartment. Very frustrating. Cartridges are quite expensive and would not like to dispose of it. Have no way of contacting the company and asking for assistance. Very disappointing.
"Oh My God!  This water filter is A-MAZING!  It removes bad taste and hot burning evil from water, it straightens your hair if it's curly and curls you hair if it's straight, it makes your children behave and gives your husband a vasectomy if you're done having children, it gives you whiter than white teeth and it freshens your breath.It's a water filter - it filters water. What more do you want?"
"Works well! The only problem I would say is the actual act of putting the product into the filter part of the fridge. Whenever we have to replace it we spill water all over the fridge. I'm not exactly sure if it's something on the end of the water filter design/brand or the fridges design/brand?????? Anyways, it works well once inserted correctly."
I tried going with another company it said they had the same filters as the Samsung but I found them to have an odd taste in them so I went back to the Samsung and the price has dropped it is only $34 which is well worth it we do get 6 months out of them are we drink water from it every day as well as make our coffee
"Easy to install. Genuine, user can verify with magnetic strip in package. Has month label sticker. Snug fit, no leak, I did not need to turn off the water though it's recommended. I give it 3 stars because there are a lot of OEM products, some Korean that are one-third the price."
It’s oem and fits perfectly. Amazon was easily the low price provider
"After we bought our beautiful Samsung French door refrigerator, we were extremely upset that the water and ice had an off taste that ruined our drinks.  We set up a service call and the technician advised us that this is not an uncommon problem with these refrigerators, but that the warranty did not cover filters and he had none on the truck.  I was so lucky to have purchased this water filter from Amazon before the technician's arrival.  We replaced the filter and the water and ice immediately tasted fresh.  l would recommend this product to anyone.  Buy it in advance and have it on hand in case you need it."
"I love the idea that i don't have to remrmber when it's time to buy another water filter for the frig.  We have 5 somrwhere around here, but eith my elderly Mom's ""oranizing"" we tend to loose more items than we keep track of. So getting a subscriptipn to this one that fits our frig is perfect."
Good
this water filter for my Samsung refrigerator is perfect.  so easy to install and my ice cubes taste great.
Works as expected. Easy install. A but costly but it is essential.
Good product exactly what I needed!
"Quick, convenient delivery!  Same product I was buying in stores. but at a cheaper price!"
Works as expected
Great value
"Picked this up when it was on sale, great buy! Some reviews mentioned getting fakes, mine was legit, and had the authenticity testing kit included, really cool!"
I ordered this item and there is no stamped production number on the cartridge. I order another directly from Samsung (slightly cheaper and also offers auto shipments) and it is exactly the same item. I took off 1 star since the item is more than the direct buy from Samsung.
This was the legit deal. So much cheaper than buying direct from Samsung.
Fits my fridge because I matched the models. The filter works as expected.
I have been using this filter for the past few years.  Never a problem.
The order was for a pack of two.  I only received one of the items; need the other one as well.  Paid for both!
Right filter easy to install
Very easy to change
price
"Awesomeness! This is the second Samsung water filter, replacement filter we've purchased through Amazon. I was going to try an off brand this time to save a little money. But, after reading the horrific feedback, and major problems that so many people had with the generics, I decided it wasn't worth little bit of money, to have any of the problems that were mentioned. With Samsung, you just, insert, turn and lock!"
Great price. Easy to install. I like the subscribe & save feature. I’ll never have to worry about running out when I need to change my water filter.
Easy to install and works
"This will be a repeat purchase for me, for as long as we have the same fridge! Couldn't be happier with this product."
"Excellent, but 4 stars because it is expensive.  When installing, if you have any kind of decent water pressure In your home, you will need to turn off the water supply and open a faucet until the pressure is off.  Otherwise, the filter is almost impossible to remove.  With no pressure it can be done with two fingers. I found using a faucet easier than pulling the fridge out to get to its water supply."
It is as the descriptions say. Quick delivery
Bought one of these to replace the filter that came stock on my Samsung refrigerator.  Water from the fridge still tastes great so no complaints there.  Only a couple drawbacks: the filter design retains a lot of water so you have to be careful not to spill it as you remove the old filter.  Also the new filter does not flow as freely as the old one.. I hope there isn't build up or scale restricting the lines somewhere..
Easy to install.
"Bought this for my Samsung model  RF28JBEDBSG food showcase French door refrigerator.  Be sure to turn the water line valve off before removing your current filter, then remove & replace it with this new one.  Run several glasses of water through it after you install it to clear the line of air and remove any fine particles from the filter and you'll have clean clear water and ice cubes for another six months."
"Bought these for my fridge Samsung RF4289HARS.  This is my second purchase.  They are OEM, and super easy to install.  The water tastes great and I have not had the slow water problem others have mentioned.  We use ours a lot (2 person household and we drink mainly water) and they last about 6 months.  Where we live, the water tastes like dirt from the tap.  I'm really sensitive to funky water, so I am so happy we bought this fridge.  The filters are well worth the money to me.  This is also the cheapest place I have found them."
Hard to install for me. I ask a neighbor to install every6 months.
Easy to install good water quality
Great deal
"It's hard to find the correct water filters for refrigerators.  This one is the manufacturers filter, and it is perfect."
"So far this water filter seems to be doing its job. It was a snap to install in my Samsung refrigerator. Why am I giving it 3 stars? Two reasons (1) the filter is pricey and (2) let's see how long the filter lasts before the red ""needs replacement"" LED lights up on the fridge panel. If the filter lasts a long time I will upgrade my rating to 4 or even 5 stars. If the filter doesn't last more than say a few months, then my rating will remain as is or possibly get lowered. I expect a $30 filter to last at least a year.I brought lowered the ranking from 3 starts to 2 stars because it hasn't been a month since I bought this filter and the red light on my fridge is starting to glow indicating that I might need to replace this filter soon. A $30 filter should last more than a month.Latest Update: The product just doesn't last. If I consider all the ice cubes and water we used that went through this filter, I don't think it amounts to a 5 gallon jug of water. This product is very, very expensive if you consider the time it lasts. Maybe the product (or the Samsung fridge) is designed to deliberately fail after a short period of time so the customer can keep repurchasing the product. this is called planned obsolescence. Needless to say we bought a generic 2-pack filter this time around."
I was buying these filters for my Samsung fridge from Best Buy where I purchased the fridge. $50 each. Then I saw these. Half the price!! Same filters!
"This was much cheaper on Amazon than at Lowe's.  It was easy to install, just remember to turn off the water first. Check your refrigerator's manual for instructions on resetting the filter alert on your fridge.  If you cannot flush water through the filter (my machine doesn't have a water dispenser) be sure to discard the ice cubes, because there will be charcoal dust from the filter (which is normal)."
Easy to install and fits great
Easy to change out
The filter works great. It's just too expensive. Can get a 3-pack of knock off filters on Amazon for almost the same price as one Samsung. That's how I'll buy next time.
Great production. It is very easy to installation.
"More expensive than generic, but does a better job"
"Have a new Samsung dbl door refer, about a year old.  Change filter light came on, so I pulled the old one to get the number.  Very easy, just turn old filter quarter turn and it pops right out.  In stores this filter retails from $39 - $44, pricey.  Always check Amazon before buying anything, and of course was a lot less, and did not have to mess with Home Depot or Lowe's.  Even got free shipping. Found there are lots of off brand filters for more than Amazon price.  Didn't even have to leave the house."
Easily installed.
Did not get filter envelope empty no water filter what happened? Ralph Brockway
Muy buenproducto
Better price than stores
Should cost a little less.
"These work perfectly! I was using a generic version bought at a discount store locally, but approximately 6 months ago, one of the generic filters caused leaking from our refrigerator. After numerous attempts to stop it, we realized it was defective. I bought this original Samsung one to replace it and it works perfectly and is a few bucks less then the generic one. I've bought two and now have a subscription to this, as it is reliable."
For the water filter on my refrigerator.
"The water in my area is so terrible, it smells like bleach and tastes awful. I buy bottled water also but this is great for the fridge and use filtered water for cooking and almost everything else. The replacement cartridges aren't cheap but they last about 6 months."
Easy to install and great value for money
"Authentic Samsung water filters come with an authentication strip and a magnet to verify authenticity.  The authentication strip is stuck to the filter. You peel it off and place it on the magnet.  If green stripes appear on the strip, then it is an authentic Samsung Filter.If these components are not included with the filter, then you cannot verify that it is an authentic Samsung water filter.  Under those circumstances, you should return it to Amazon, selecting ""missing parts"" as the reason for the return.The reason Samsung developed this authentication technology to include along with their filters is to combat an industry that produces counterfeit Samsung water filters.  The fakes look just like the real thing but do not include Samsung's authentication strip and magnet.  Therefore, be warned."
"The product fit well and functions well.  However, the insertion/removal tab at the bottom is smooth and, for me, was impossible to remove from the filter slot without using a tool.  Poor design.  With a simple roughened surface or edge on the removal tab, the removal of the old filter would have been simple.  The designer needs to remember that the old filter seats with an ""O"" ring and requires effort to unseat."
"Easily found in search, delivered quickly, good price"
"I'm not a mathematician. In fact, I hate math. But, I was quite surprised to note that buying a 1 pack of water filters was $28.85 and a 3 pack was $92.90. Utilizing my math skills (I said I hated math, not that I couldn't do it) $28.85 times 3 should equal $86.55. But a 3 pack is $92.90. Whaaaaat? So, buying three 1 packs, I will save $6.35. Ok, this amount will not break the bank, but 6 bucks is 6 bucks.These aren't bad water filters and I will continue to buy them, but please don't waste money buying a 3 pack. Buy three 1 packs and use the 6 bucks you saved to buy a fancy coffee somewhere. And shame on you, TwitterOutlet for bilking people out of $6. For shame. For shame!"
Samsung recommended this and I have had issues with the ice maker. Fridge is only 1 yr 0ld. Not sure if the product changed this or not. Great price for the 3 though...
Very good product
This is the OEM filter and works as it should. Taking it out can be a struggle which required some pliers to loosen the filter.
I have the Samsung Side by Side refrigerator and needed a new filter for it.  I looked at the stores and they are pretty expensive and I do not trust generic filters in an appliance of this cost.  This was two Samsung brand water filters for my fridge that were the price of just one filter at the store.  This was a great buy and the filter works perfectly.  I will defintely buy more here in the future.  This was a great buy and was exactly what I needed for my fridge!
Fast delivery and item accuracy
Does what it is supposed to.
It's a water filter...
does what it is supposed to do. Pretty easy to install and about $35 cheaper than local stores.
Easy to install cost is responsible for a 2 pack
Bought this before so it was a no-brainer. Easy to install.
Installed this in my Samsung refrigerator. Helps with water and ice filtration. This is much less expensive on Amazon than I can buy locally. Thanks!
"Been using these for years. Fits perfectly. Other than the price keeps going up, its a good filter."
have ordered this item before....as before all went as it should
"This is the genuine product. Just make sure you don't purchase something like this from a third party seller, where you are *highly* likely to receive a counterfeit product."
"A Lowes salesperson did a comparison evaluation on our tap water, Britta pitcher, and refridgerator water in an effort to sell us an RO system.  The RO system was the best, of course, next best was water from the fridge using this filter.  The filter is a pain to install, but that's the fridge, not the filter.  Also, for a family of 3 with daily use, the filter lasts about 6 months.  (We use the Britta to get filtered water for cooking.)"
"It is easy to install, and seems to taste good"
I very pleased with this product it fit in my refig(samsung)
"I installed this filter last Wednesday.  Later that day I travelled for an overnight trip.  When I got back home on Thursday afternoon our home was flooded.We have a repairmen coming to check out our Samsung refrigerator tomorrow, but there is no question in my mind that this filter is faulty and caused the flooding (or fridge filled internally, leaking out from underneath and then, when opening the middle drawer to inspect, had a waterfall!).UPDATE:  culprit turns out to be the water line housing in our Samsung refrigerator.  It has to be replaced -- with no assurance the same thing won't happen again.  Damage to our hardwood floors:  $12,758.  Buyer beware of Samsung appliances!"
Good price .
"There are cheaper knockoffs of this filter available, but I feel like drinking water isn't the place to try to save money. I wanted to get the brand since it has the certifications.  I'm glad I went for the top-of the line version, it works well and gives me peace of mind."
Perfect for my Samsung. Super easy installation and the water tastes great
Direct fit and great value
I truly like this product. It works great and does not cost as much as the name brand. Provides clean water for my family and fits perfectly.
"Easy to install, appears to be working properly."
Good price for genuine product
There's really nothing to think about when purchasing this if you need it for your water filter. It gets the job done and I've had no problems with it and I've bought it back in January which is 4 months ago. Very simple to replace with the old one. It comes with a simple instructions which is a little incorrect in some parts but a little common sense will help guide you to be like oh that's what you meant but with my model it doesn't go like that.Anyways if you need a filter and this is it bottom line is just get it unless you can get a discount else where.
"Expensive but convienantI like the fact that this OEM product fits and doesn’t leak like other reviews on a non-OEM filter. Worth the cost for having peace of mind it’s the right part and won’t leak.I haven’t tried other brands but reviews I’ve read, they are not positive. This is the 2nd filter now I’ve purchased and both have been 100% exact fit."
Happy to have an easy purchase of these off Amazon
"There is a line in an old Mae West movie where the man says, ""This picture looks just like you!"" Mae replies, ""Well, it otta, I posed for it!""This filter fits perfectly the first time, every time and has not leaked since installed three weeks ago. It's nice when you go to the trouble of purchasing OEM parts, the parts are the exactly the replacement part as advertised."
I bought one of these months ago and it worked great. I just now purchased 3 of them so I don't have to wait for them to be delivered next time the filter needs to be replaced. giving it 4 stars because when I bought these 3 it was cheaper to by a 1 pack 3 times rather than just buying one 3pack. Why would you make it more expensive to buy a 3 pack than to buy three 1 packs is beyond me.
Value for money
The product arrived as planned and was easy to install.
"Bought a new Samsung fridge about 8 months ago.  Filter light just came on.  I used to buy cheaper 2 or 3-pack sets, but I went with this one for my first filter purchase, and water tastes amazingly fresh."
I have purchased 2 of these since I got a new Samsung refrigerator and have been extremely happy with them. The first time I changed my filter I decided to try one of the cheaper brands and definitely got what I paid for. After a short period of time the off brand filter clogged up and I had almost zero water pressure. Even though I think these are over priced I will never try another brand.
Great Product
Don’t understand what you mean by flavor. It was very difficult to remove one filter and put in the next. I had to have someone stronger help me.
"Hmm... I don't know really what to say about this filter.  I opted for the original Samsung filter as a replacement, but the filtering and ice performance has significantly changed.  The water from the door dispenses way more slowly, and it takes about twice the time to fill up the ice bin.  I followed the Samsung support instructions on resetting the ice and door dispensing features, but without any improvement back to ""normal.""  I think next time I will go with a generic replacement at half the cost."
"The water dispenser took half day to stop leaking. Had to remove and reinstall to stop the leaking. Be patient. Fyi, old cartridge was very difficult to remove."
"This is a must have for the refrigerator.  I give this a 10. It works great, the water is safe and clean to drink. It is easy to install. The price was waaaay better than other local stores in my area. I highly recommend it!"
"Do not use fake replacements. I am not a Damsung fan for a lot of reasons, however, when it comes to water filters, use the original replacements."
Works as intended
Everything  perfect
THANKS
"I bought the cheaper version of filter thinking there was no difference, I was wrong. The cheap filter made water taste uncleaned, kinda like no filtering at all. But this filter made our water taste clean and crisp like bottled water. No more cheap filters for us, and no I don't work for these people. I just pike my water tasting good."
Lasts the 6 months that it says it will.
"Sorry not Sorry, I rant the thing that now we need to change this every 6 months, when in the past a filter use to be good for one year or more, is to much waste.I hate how the water pressure down a lot when I just reset the filter trying to fool the fridge.But anyway, maybe I'll start using OEM as are the same but cheaper.I don't blame the product but the system."
Easy to install
Thanks Amazon for stocking Samsung filters. I use them 2 times a year.
Replacing water filter——————————However not easy for an older lady to replace!
"Price jumped over $18 since I last purchased this filter 6 months ago. I've been buying this filter for the past 3 years and it works perfectly. It is the original Samsung brand filter. But why the price gouging when Samsung has been having so many quality issues affecting their image. Phones, washing machines, and ice makers all defective and they aren't very responsive to their customers. So unless you want to take a chance on off-brand filters, bite the bullet and accept being gouged.  When we buy our next home in a few years, we won't be installing anything from Samsung."
Delivers fast and easy to install.
"I needed  to find a replacement for my water filter Model# HAF-Cin/EXP  replacement cartridge was DA29-00020A, they do not make that filter anymore. I called Sears and asked about the DA29-00020B and they said it was fine to replace with that filter. Easy to install just twist it on. Then get a bowl and empty a gallon of water out which will get the water moving correctly. Yes these cartridges are expensive but I found Amazon to have the best price. Very happy I found it."
The Samsung refrigerator filters work fine and are very easy to install.
Just like advertised.
Easy to replace the old filter.
Works great. Much cheaper than Lowe’s.
I was hesitant. Very easy installation.
"The first filter I got was fine (11/14).  No problem.  Immediately after I installed this one, the water flow was significantly decreased.  I email Amazon and received a quick reply stating they would  to replace it w/ one day shipping (excellent service!).  In the interim, my kitchen flooded.  Somehow, the filter had caused a leak.  As soon as I removed the filter, the leak stopped.  However, there was a LOT of water before I caught it.  Could have been a lot worse had I left the house.  I will install the replacement and watch it carefully for leaks.  That should NOT be needed."
"After buying the ""official"" water filter cartridge for my Samsung Refrigerator, the water system worked fine for a few days.  Then it started that crazy rattle again.  After 2 plumbers and three repairmen, I think it's hopeless.  My next step is to just remove the cartridge and try it without the filter."
They delivered on time with no damage.  It was a great price considering I purchased brand name. I've purchased Samsung water filters for my fridge previously and I was very pleased with them.  I expect to get the same performance with these. So far so good. No leaks. When I compared the price I got with this dealer on Amazon to the stores around me I paid much less for them.
Easy to install
nothing
So far so good picture is decent.
"it occurred to me that I could save half to 25% off buying an aftermarket filter. However, if you are going to be spending the extra money to purify your water, why not make sure that it's done appropriately? If you think about it, aftermarket filters don't guarantee you what's inside."
"I ordered based on the description showing the fridge model number rather than pulling the filter out and checking what was already install, no issues.Installed without issues, no leaking (be sure to wipe up water that came out of old filter to avoid perception the new on leaked.)I ran a gallon of water through it before using it as suggested by the OEM.  Tastes good, water flow is same as before.Will buy a couple more!"
Perfect match for my refrigerator
Replaced original equipment perfectly
Great product!
easy to install
"Thanks goodness for this product... we have had a Samsung refrigerator for about a year and a half.  All of a sudden when it would pull water from the line it would make a horribly loud knocking noise coming from the back of the machine.  Since we knew it was related to the water line, I thought I would first try changing the filter.  We have done so, and the noise stopped completely.Oh!  And do not be alarmed if the first few cubes are dark grey (or black)... apparently this is normal."
"When the filter shows time to change the filter symbol, just remove the old filter and put in the new.  Takes at least a couple of minutes."
These are  Samsung filters and I would expect them to work seamlessly and they do.
This was a great buy and it was an OE part!! Cheaper than buying from Lowe's or Home Depot. Very satisfied with this purchase!
"The exact match to the original filter that came with the fridge. Also you save some money, it cost way more in Lowes or Home Depot."
Works like it should
"Bought a samsung fridge from my local big box store and about 6 months later I needed a new water filter. I went back to the same store and they wanted $50 for one!!! I showed them the price on amazon and they said they couldn't match it, so I pushed the ""order now"" button and had it delivered the next day thanks to amazon prime! Great water filter and a heck of a deal on Amazon, at least when I bought it. Works in my fridge perfectly."
"This is the mfr recommended replacement cartridge since Samsung discontinued the 20A.  No problems at all putting it in.  I didn't shut off the water to the fridge, and I could feel some resistance when I turned the filter to lock it in.  If I had shut the water off then there would probably be less resistance, but still I was easily able to install it.The pricing made no sense at all.  The single pack was $30; the double pack was $90; the triple pack was $94.  So just order 2 or 3 singles and scratch your head as to why they're priced this way."
As advertised.
Original quality.
"Not the exact match for my filter but, it works..."
Love product as can’t buy in store locally anymore
Nice
Great value..fits perfect in samsung refrigerator
This is an original product. The water tastes good.
This filter fit my refrigerator perfectly and improved the water flow. The reviews and photos I read made me nervous about purchasing this filter until I noticed that there were a lot of different sellers. I purchased my filter directly from Amazon and it doesn't look like the inauthentic filters that people are posting photos of. Perhaps they got scammed by a different seller. I'm glad that my filter works great and makes the water flow better. No leaks here!
"I suspect I will soon feel about filters the way I feel about ink cartridges for my printer...they soon cost more than the appliance. That said, it was easy to install and less expensive than at the brick and mortar big box store."
"These really do work. I go through filters about every five to six months. The signal that they need to be changed is a significantly reduced flow through the in-door water dispenser. So, the filer is actually filtering out something.  The resulting water is odor and taste free.  I think there are after market versions of this product - and in-line water filters for the incoming water line - but I'll stick with Samsung products."
"Well I didn't realize that the water filter that came with my Samsung fridge was only filtering out one type of pollutant. This filter removes four different classes of chemicals, including Atrazine! I was amazed by this because I did my research thesis in college on the abundance of Atrazine in ground water in the US. This chemical and I are not friends, and I certainly am glad that my water filter is removing it!"
Easy to install
This filer is OEM from Samsung.  There are other filters on Amazon that claim to be Samsung OEM filters and they are not.  This filter fit correctly and is a genuine Samsung product.  The holographic seal on the box helps to identify it as a true Samsung product.
Good price for the filters
"Buying the three (3) was a better deal overall. The filters that I received were exactly as pictures and worked with my Samsung refrigerator. I followed the provided instructions regarding the first use and now am receiving crystal clear, fresh tasting water from my refrigerator. We use the filtered water from the refrigerator quite a bit and seem to be replacing them on the early side of the estimated life span."
"Great quality, fast shipping"
"For the price of this product, I think it fairly lasts a long time.  I bought my house 2 years ago with a new Samsung refrigerator and in 2 years we have only had to replace the filter twice. And there are 3 of us drinking water and using ice cubes. Easy to install and Amazon is the easiest place to purchase this without running all over town (Best Buy is only other retailer I could find it, if you are in a pinch and need one urgently you can go to a BBY store, but I find the best price for these on Amazon)"
The price could be less. That would make the purchase a lot easier on our pockets.
I have a Samsung refrigerator (which I love!) and purchase this filter on amazon because it is so much cheaper than my local stores. I have tried non Samsung brands and I wasn't happy with the product. Either the water flow was slow or the filter didn't last very long. I feel like we drink quite a bit of water in my house and we replace the Samsung filter about every 6 months on average. We have two adults and two kids at home and family over all the time.
Just as expected. Will order again from seller. Delivered quickly.
no coments
Genuine product and lasts a long time unlike a lot of the cheaper filters. Cost more money but worth it. I have bought 3 and 4 packs of the cheap filter in the past and used them all in less time then this 1 filter. It might be in my head but the water tastes better with this filter than the others.
"I tried some cheaper unbranded versions as I was recommended by the store that sold the refrigerator to save money, but the cheaper version would make strange noises, I though it was the refrigerator and tried another brand, but it made different noises. Also the other brands slowed water flow. This product works perfectly, great water flow and quality and no strange noises. I recommend saving money by not wasting money buying unbranded versions and throwing them away. This works well."
Yes
"We bought this filter when our stream of water was reduced to drops.  It seems to do the trick.  The water tastes decent and at first came out with renewed vigor, but just after a month of use it is slowing down a little.  Not sure if this is with all filters, as this is our first in-fridge filter.  Didn't want to mess with a non-name brand, but may try one next time just to compare."
My Samsung refrigerator is 6 years old and this filter was perfect and easy to install.
"Our family has a new Samsung refrigerator and the filter light is on (meaning it needs a new water filter). I know it's mostly for taste/odor, but we want to replace the filter when the manufacturer recommends. The actually replacing is super easy (no complaints there), but for us to replace the filter every ~6months for $25-$25? Kind of ridiculous. I think we'll try to look for trusted 3rd party filters, but other than the price, the Samsung filter works."
"The water filter met all expectations and I was very pleased with my purchase.  The only concern I had was that buying the filters individually was less expensive than buying the multi-pack.  Since the filters should be changed out every six months, the multi packs should be less expensive than the individual if the customer want to make sure that they have filters to cover them for the year."
It was great for my Samsung fridge and it didn’t really do anything for the Taste it was just normal clean fresh water
Too pricey
Easy to follow instructions
"Great water purifier for my Samsung Fridge - easy to change, but they are a little pricey! I did buy a double package this time on Amazon, which made them a little cheaper.
Samsung DA29-00020B Refrigerator Water Filter, 2 Pack"
Easy install
Seems to be working as described. Make sure to read the instructions carefully and run as much water through the filter as suggested. I didn't do this and we ended up with carbon smelling ice (which looked a little gray) that had to be thrown out. You should be able to use the water run through the filter to water your plants or something if you're worried about wasting it.
"what can i say, i have the fridge that uses these so i needed them.  i was scared off of the no-name filters, mostly because of the reviews that said they leaked.  i wouldn't be surprised if those were not legit.  placed so that people like me would buy the samsung brand.  but it is what it is, and they work well."
"This filter is required for my Samsung Ref.  Have used this brand before, but it is much more reasonable from Amazon."
I would recommend this filter. I bought the knock off filters and there was a gap between the end of the handle and the filter edge. Maybe it just looked that way on my fridge but I wouldnt recommend the knock off filters just for the way they looked. My filter is directly in line of sight as you open the door. If yours is hidden somewhere then the knock off would be fine. I will be buying this filter again when it is time to change mine out. It worked great and is a perfect fit in my fridge. Expensive but worth it in my opinion!
This is just the filter I needed and I saved $20 buying it on Amazon vs in my local retail store.  I will buy more!
product only lasted 1 month after installing. change filter lite is on. I tried to reset lite and it still stays on.Have purchased before and product lasted as advertised 6 months. this time lasted only 1 month
I checked several aftermarket filters but found Samsung filters out the most contaminants. Very pleased with these and will continue to purchase them in the future. I drink a lot of water each day and I want the best filter I can get.
"Original Samsung filter is better. We have tried others, they a lot of issues:1) Don't fit well.2) Half the water flow rate - you have to wait for ages to fill up a bottle.3) Lasted only half as long as the original.That all said, it could have been cheaper. So much a utility - should compare with external (more sophisticated) filtering in cost."
very good
"This is the best filter for my fridge. I bought a generic version because it was a little cheaper than this one, but the quality wasn't good at all--the black ring around the top part of the filter actually broke as I tried to install it in my fridge, so I returned the generic item immediately to Amazon, and spent a few more bucks to get this filter."
This is a great replacement for the Samsung fridge filters. We have ordered this a few times and never  had any issues.  It lasts the full 6 months and does a decent job.  I wish these filters took out more of the chlorine taste though
Great product
"Purchased this filter back in June 2018 and the water and ice still taste great.  Looks like it will last six months like the box says.  The only thing is it takes a few gallons to flush the filter once installed, but I can understand why."
"I've been using these filters for almost a year.  They do a great job to turn your refrigerator into your water source.  I no longer need to purchase bottled water because I know what I'm getting is good, filtered water.  Auto delivery is nice too so I don't have to worry about keeping this on my calendar.  Less plastic in the dumps!"
easy to install
"The product has always worked well, but this was a really good deal."
"don't buy these anywhere else. you will pay double the price anywhere else for these filters.... i personally think water filters in the frig are a racket and manufacturers like Samsung see it as a continuous way to make money off of the consumer after the big purchase is made.... genius from a business standpoint and of course the consumer will keep buying these as that little red light displays on the frig for replacement, i do...."
very easy to use.
The filter is easy to install and the water is very clear.
This item was one of the best filters for my Samsung
Value
The filter was easy to install and operate. The fridge tells me when I need to install a new one-about every three months.
"We use the fridge filter because it's much more convenient and the quality of the filtration is outstanding, so I do recommend this replacement."
A samgsung refrigerator . Second one I’ve purchased. Easy to remove and install.
"I bought these to replace the water filter that came in the fridge when we purchased it.The filter fits as promised and was easy to replace.My water tastes good and clean, and I can't tell any difference between these filters and the one that came in it originally."
Nice
"We ordered this brand new item late Saturday night and received it by 7:00 A.M. ON SUNDAY. We are shock, and impressed with this AMAZON service, quality and delivery."
Worked great
"This has one black rubber gasket at the top, the filter that came with the refrigerator had 2 thinner gaskets.  Anyway, it works, no leaks, no cloudy, its fine.  I just think $50 is too much when the generic ones are $9 to $16.  Next time I'll try a third party.  I just didn't want to risk a water leak."
"We are renters and it seems not long after moving in, both the sink and refrigerator water filters needed replaced and they weren't cheap. After looking at local retailers, this was the best deal by far. The order came quickly and was exactly what we needed. I thought the product description of the discrepancy in model numbers was clearly addressed by the manufacturer. The filter came well packaged and was easy to change. The seller even sent a personal email following arrival confirmation which I thought was a nice, personal touch. Would definitely recommend product and seller."
"I wanted to stick with the name brand filter for my refrigerator and this item fit the bill. Easy enough to install, the first one lasted almost exactly one year with very hard water and heavy usage (ice)."
Exactly what I needed for my refrigerator.
Easy install. Water taste
Super easy to install
"Great tasting water, every time. Learned recently that you don't have to replace these as often as the manual says... I had family visiting and they accidentally reset the filter (held the water button down instead of just one touch select) and it was 2 weeks before it would have lit up to replace the filter. It has been 2 months since then and the water still tastes great and the flow hasn't slowed. Reset a month or so before the light is due to come on and you may just say yourself some money!"
Great fir curly hair
"Easy to install, and last about 6 months depending on usage."
Great value for the money
I was able to get a great deal at Amazon compare to other places.
Well I haven't died yet from the water going through these and they fit perfectly as they should so I give it a 5.  Sure wish they were a little cheaper though.  I don't change when the light on Samsung refrigerator telling me it is time as I am single and while I use water through the filter I don't use the same as a family and these change notices come on by time passed not actual usage so mine last quite awhile.
It’s good
I got the latest and greatest version so I'm very happy with the product I received.  My only complaint for 1 star less is the price is way too high.
"Bought this to replace the existing filter and I've had slow water flow.  I have to remove the filter and reinstall it for the normal water pressure to return.  The water tastes great and is filtered fine, but it just slows the water flow down from normal."
"This is a hard-working filter.  I've been tempted to buy one of the cheaper after-market alternatives but stuck with this since I've well water and need good filtering.  The filter perceptibly improves taste and its specifications for sediment, pharmaceuticals and cyst removal is impressive.  I go through one every 5-6 months (the water flow usually prompts me to change the filter - also a testament to the filtering capabilities!) and it's worth the price."
Great value and easy to install
Best deal I could find for this particular model number and I looked at three other places before making this purchase.
"Original filter very hard to remove.  Being cautious, I u-tubed it and there was an excellent demonstration of what to do.  Quick shipment too.  Will definitely do this next year when it comes to replacing the filter.  Great job.  Quick and exactly as described."
"Great quality filter, I would buy it again.  Fit my Samsung refrigerator water filter."
Seems to work well. The water tastes good. Haven’t done a water test yet to tell how well it is filtering
"OMG, we were paying twice the price for these filters. Will never purchase anywhere else, great value for a quality product."
"I was hesitant to buy this b/c of the reviews about people getting a fake one. I finally bit the bullet and bought it anyways.The delivery was fast before scheduled date.The product it self was great. Fits in to my Samsung french door fridge perfectly. The product itself says Samsung made in Korea. It filters out good water, I can test the difference. As far as I can tell it is a genuine samgsung filter I will buy fri here again"
Great product!
NA
"Price is good compare to other places, fast delivery, glad to have it"
"Worked as needed best thing was the cost far below box stores pricing, and I didn't have to drive to get this."
I always purchase the OEM water filters for my refrigerators since is the generic ones do not have the same NSF certifications.  These filters always install easily and do the trick.  Personally it is worth it to me to spend a few more bucks every 6 months than a generic filter knowing that the contaminants in our water are minimized.
"A bit expensive, works ok."
This filter has been tested to filter out a lot of contaminants versus others I've seen. It is easy to install and doesn't take up a lot of space. It can be a bit pricey though so watch it for price drops and stock up.
Worth it works great
Exactly the same as the one it came with. Works great. No complaints. Super fast shipping !
"Great filter.  Works as advertised.  The only thing that I don't like is that for the first gallon or so, the water sputters out of the dispenser while the filter is ""primed"".  I don't know if that is a function of the filter, or the refrigerator, however.  I'd give it 5 stars, but at the end of the day, it's a filter.  If it was cheaper, I'd give it 5 stars."
Original replacement. Works like the one they comes with the fridge. They are pricey but can’t get around that if you want an OEM.
"The best filter for your Samsung fridge. Do not make the mistake I made. I bought a cheapo instead of the original filter and had to drink chlorine tasting water for few months because I thought all filters are the same. NO, they are not. This is the one to get if you want a great tasting cup of water. It is worth the money, believe me."
Great deal for asking price. They are easy to install.
"Had to return it as it's missing the Samsung Authentication label on the filter itself.  Strangely enough, the box says the filter  inside should have the authentication label, but it doesn't. The one  bought from Samsung directly has the authenticating label on the filer."
Kind of pricey. It was good after I figured out o have to apply a little pressure to install. It kept back firing on me.
Very easy to replace and the fit is perfect. Functional. But value for money is lacking in my opinion.
We drink a lot of filtered water & being able to buy 2 filters at once for our Samsung refrigerator is great.
"These work great but are pretty expensive, I was going to try the generic brands but opted for the Samsung"
It does it job. Had to use YouTube to figure out where it goes. But it works just great.
Perfect fit and good value.
Extremely fast shipping. Came in 12 hours after I pressed that order button. The filter is genuine and very cheap. Will buy again.
BY THIS SAMSUNG BRAND! the aftermarket cheap ones leaked and ruined my floors. And the water tasted manufactured/disgusting. These are well worth the extra money in taste and peace of mind not worrying if they will leak or not.
Arrived perfectly packaged and with authentication tag. Was able to confirm that the filter was legit.  Got it at steal price too!
great shipped really quick all good as described
It was just right
"wish it was cheaper, but it is the name brand filter.  i wanted something that fit like original and the other brands that are cheaper sounded like they were a bit small and could rattle.  this is oem, so fit is perfect.  for the cost, per month, i was willing to pay a bit more and have it fit as designed."
Same as you buy in the store only half the price. Made by Samsung not a knockoff.Will buy again!
Will order replacements again....works great!
Good product but over priced
A little difficult to  install.  Poor design on the part of Samsung.  Even the technician had to go to You Tube to find out how to install.Instructions very vague.  Wish Samsung had left the water filter where it was in the older models. (Up to the right side above the shelf).
"This filter does not work on my Samsung refrigerator.  Reading other reviews, it appears to be a scam product.  The water does not flow through and makes a loud, hammering noise.  Don't waste your money."
as expected
"I've used one of three and it's worked like a charm. Reading the reviews of the knock-offs, many people complained of leaks with others saying you need to disconnect the water supply. I've pulled and replaced the name-brand filter 3 times now without turning off the water supply with no ill effects. These are also rated to remove lead from the water while the knock-offs are not."
Easy to install
Works as expected.  Feels pricey (across the board).
"I used to by these at the local big box retailer.  Found them here on Amazon and the price is much better and you can setup a subscription so it is shipped to you on an interval.  The product is supposed to be good for about 6 months of filtering water and for my family of 6, water drinkers, that is pretty much how long it lasts."
Water filter
"It is necessary to change fridge, so I have to get one."
"This is the factory original filter for our refrigerator and installed in literally seconds with a half turn. A great buy on our part. FYI can go much longer than the refrigerators filter change reminder, as long as the water looks and tastes great still. I recommend it"
Good product
Muy bueno
"I tried to get the off-brand to go in my Samsung frig, but it's a no go.  The off-brand does not want to fit right, and I spent a LOT of time cleaning up the water that spilled all over the deli drawer due to the poor manufacturing of it.  The Samsung brand fits right in, and works amazing.  I guess you get what you pay for."
"Very pricey, but fit my Samsung RF23J9011SR perfectly.  I was worried because this product number described as DA29-00020B and the one I removed was DA29-00020B-1, however when the product arrived it had DA29-00020B-1 printed on it and was a perfect fit for me frig."
Bought many times. Every half year
I looked at the cheaper filters and reviews and elected to buy the real deal for my Samsung fridge..and glad I did.  The filter lasted for about six months (which is what I expected the lifespan to be) .... cost here is slightly lower than going to the big box stores to purchase.  Would definitely buy again (and I did :) )
I like it 👏👍😁
Tried some off brands that didn't work.  These work great for a better price than in stores.
These last good and are the correct brand for our Samsung refrigerator.
water filter
First review after buying 1 pack for first time:  Water tastes better.  Works fine.Second review after I bought another 2-pack: bottle and package looks similar to the old one.  Worried about counterfeits.  Water seems to taste better.  Water flow is slower than previous.  Also the packaging did not come with the stickers for the months.  It usually does.  In there instructions it says put a sticker with the month on but I can't since there are no stickers included.  Not really worried about sticker but potential counterfeit.  Could be nothing but it worries me.
"Cannot go Wong with ordering in Amazon. Received on time, with ease. Great price for a original Samsung water filter. If you do want to get a product that is certified original. This is the one to get."
"Fits our refrigerator perfectly.  I haven't really done much price comparison, but I love being able to order it and have it delivered because I never seem to remember to pick one up while I am out and will end up with the ""replace filter"" light being on forever if I don't just go ahead and order it online.  It does seem to be a reasonable price from what I can tell, and the water that we get from it tastes great."
Great
The price was HALF what we have been paying at big box home stores & it is exactly the same product.
Prime often offers the double pack at a great price: sometimes two for the price of one. Super worth it!
Ease to install
The Samsung filter is the exact replacement that I needed for my refrigerator.  I don't change the filter as often as they recommend and this filter goes way beyond when the fridge light tells me to replace it.
exact replacement
As advertised
Fits perfectly
Good
"We LOVE our refrigerator filtered water!  Saves money, saves plastic and most of all keep my water tasting great!  Lasts longer than 6 months and I use it all day."
Exelwnte

Installed this a month ago. A perfect fit for my 4 door Flex Samsung counter depth refrigerator. Took about 2 seconds to remove the old one and then 2 seconds to install the new one. I did not shut off my water line due to the fact that its behind the fridge and would be such a pain to pull it away from the cabinetry. Not single problem.
"1st: Received shipment in good condition2nd: Great pricing (this was the lowest I could find in my search endeavors)3rd: Installed and is working properly without any problemsI want to thank the other reviewers regarding this product that comes in the multi-pack on Amazon's site. They indicated they bought the multi-packs thinking it would be cheaper and found out the multi-packs were not cheaper than purchasing them separately. I bought two of the single pack. So far, I am happy with the product and happy with Deep Discounts."
"At first, this filter seemed a bit pricey... But we are just shy of a year and the light just came on (and the chlorine taste came back). I was lucky to get 6mo out of the spin on canister style from the old fridge."
"This is the OEM filter. It removes contaminants and lead according to the literature, and it does improve the taste. I use the water for my coffee, tea, home made soda [Sodastream], and drinking water. Very satisfied with the taste. I also make a habit of replacing these whenever the ""replace light"" comes on."
Price is right
"I was hesitant to buy this because the filter that came with my Samsung refrigerator was labeled DA29-00020A, not B, but I could not find anyone selling a filter ending in A.  Luckily this filter was identical to the spent one that came with the refrigerator and it works great.  So, at least for my fridge, it seems like the A and B filters are interchangeable... maybe A's are just the ones that ship with new products???  Here is the fridge I have: 
Samsung RF4287HARS 28 cu. ft. 4-Door French Door Refrigerator - Stainless Steel"
Perfect fit. I replace it after filter light comes on twice. For some reason this on had smaller opening than previous one so water flows slower than before. Other than that it was exactly same.Update 6.2016. Another one ordered. Perfect fit. This one had larger hole so water flow is back to normal.I considered to buy non OEM but I didn't think it was worth the risk of wrong fit or leaks
"Good product and easy to install. I ordered some before and choose to purchase again. Only thing is, the price is a little bit high. Wish it can last a long time."
"When we bought our new refrigerator, I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to find the correct filters.  Amazon made this very easy.  These filters are very easy to install."
I'll only purchase factory original Samsung filters as I've had OEM off market brands leak like crazy. This performs as it should and I've never ever had a true Samsung filter leak. Don't waste your hard earned money on cheap imitations -- buy the name brand Samsung filters and save yourself a lot of hassles and costly repairs!
Great filter. I was planning to opt cheaper filters but found that this was NSF53 grade. Its totally worth. My area water is very hard and this filters the water pretty good. The water tastes way better than how it tastes with Brita or Pur water filters. Good  investment even though its double the cost of filtes with lower NSF53 grade.
The filter was easy to install. Delivered on time
Much better than going to the store
The filter works well.
"twist and turn.  It was that simple to replace.  Took 3 seconds.  You need to let the water run in order to get a funky taste out of the new cartridge, but good investment to buy the three pack."
Used for the filtering of refrigerator & freezer water.  Improved taste.
Had a lower cost generic filter leak and it was no fun finding the puddle on the floor in the morning. Decided to stick with the name brand to avoid any further issues. I just wait till it turns red before changing to get maximum life out of it. Wish they were a little more competitive but if they dropped the price the CEO of Samsung probably wouldn't get his $50-mill bonus at the end of the year.
"Original product, good quality."
Super easy to install the longest part was emptying 3 gallons of water when she put the filter in and filling up pictures ever let it run through
Good
I purchased this filter for my new Samsung refrigerator. It worked out great. I would purchase again.
"So not sure about the previous reviews stating that these cost more in a 3 pack versus individually, when I did my shopping the 3 pack was less expensive (not by much, but still).  This filter went into our Samsung fridge (these are OEM Samsung filters by the way, not 3rd party) RF4287HABP with no issues, just like the filter that came with the fridge.  Water tastes fine, no issues there - I dont have a way to measure the crap in the water, so I can only assume the filter is doing its job."
"Just turn off water valve, remove old and replace new.  Could not be easier."
"Arrived very quickly, as described, and fit our fridge. This was also 1/2 the price of the ones I saw in Home Depot."
"I'ved used cheaper filters.  Cheap filters would not give my a quart of water without shutting off.  Had to call a plumber twice because of the cheap filter, they damaged the insert.  I only use genuine Samsung OEM filters now.  I can get 2-quarts of water out of the OEM filters."
Great item easy to install.
Great product!
"There's not much to say about these water filters for our refrigerator --this is the one type which fits our model of Samsung refrigerator, thus it's not like we have a choice of what to buy. However, it's super convenient to order these online and they're cheaper, too (vs hoping the closest store which carries them isn't out of stock...again)."
As advertised.
"I've been ordering these genuine Samsung filters for a few years and they always work perfectly and the water tastes great.  Recently I tried to buy the fake filters because it was less than half the price, but it leaked.  I tried to reinstall it several times and had the same problem  I returned the fake filters and purchased the genuine filter again and it worked perfectly."
"Our water filter light went red and almost immediately the water tasted off. We ordered this replacement, popped out the used filter and popped in the new filter, ran a gallon of water through it and wow, the water tasted amazing. It was that easy. There were a few bubbles in the water stream making the water stop and go for a few days but then it evened out. We have very hard water. Our original lasted 6 months. This one has been going strong for four months and I expect it to go another two."
Thanks so fast!
"Very fast shipping, good price and good product. A+"
Easy to install
I'm happy with this product. It's easy to plug in and the quality of the water and ice is great.The only negative with it is that the manufacturer suggests running 3 gallons through it after it is installed. This means a lot of running back and forth between the refrigerator and sink while filling up 3 gallons of water one cup at a time.
For the money you can't beat these replacement filters. I have ordered these a few times and they work just fine. I have seen others say they are fake. I did have one leak and all I had to do was re-seat it by taking it out and screwing back in. No more leaks.
Good product
"So far so good. Labeling is slightly different vs the stock one that came with my fridge which had ""-1"" at the end of the number.Just remember to flush 3gal through before use."
Easy direct replacement
"Very happy with the taste of the water after installing this filter ,it was also very easy to install."
"After installing this filter, I tested the water and showed 122 vs the tap water which is 200! I was trying to eliminate the water machine we have! (water ranges between 9-20). So nope! I will stick to the machine now."
Like the OEM product.
"Haven't had working fridge water in forever. Moved into a new place and needed a replacement filter, got this one and hurrraaayyy good tasting cold water. Deeply prefer this to my mavea pitcher (which I was quite attached to) because I dont have to fill anything."
"Filters look legit in sealed package.  Installed first filter, and functioned normally for about a month.  Then my water flow reduced dramatically from the refrigerator water dispenser.  Dropped to about half the water flow.  Found out to test if filter is restricting water flow you simply remove filter and see if flow returns to normal.  Sure enough it did.  So figured maybe filter was defective or something with water supply.  Replaced and install second filter.  Sure enough one month later same thing happens.  Now I'm sure my water supply is not that contaminated that a filter that would last 6 months is clogged to the point of half the water flow after a month.  Also since the water flow reduction happens so sudden I feel this has to be defective filters causing the problem."
esta funcionado a la perfeccion
it works and cheaper than Lowes
It's a water filter. It fits. It's certified to remove lead which is a concern in many American cities these days. The price is worth it for both peace of mind and nice tasting drinking water.
"This appears to be the actual OEM replacement. Although it is more expensive than some of the after market products, this version works very well. We have had issues with the generic products leaking and the o-ring breaking. We have not seen that with this version. Also this is NOT carbonated"
Good and was very happy for last 4 years .. found cheaper alternatives which doesn’t seem to have any difference from this . Company should consider reducing price and generic are way cheaper
I order this filter set every time I need new ones.  Perfect match to my Samsung refrigerator freezer side-by-side.
Always good to have one on hand
Me gusta porque son varios por un buen precio.
What’s not to like. It filters the fridge water. Don’t buy off brand. I did didn’t work. Want one? Ha.
"As always, Works great. No leaking."
"I purchased these from amazon and I order the genuine Samsung Water Filter, super easy to install and I can taste the difference from tap and then using the filtered water from my samsung fridge.5 stars!!"
"I found this worked well in my Samsung refrigerator and was easy to install. Samsung has another filter with the same numbers, but I chose this one because it showed it would take more contaminates out of the water"
Very please with the price.
Good value for money.The water flow seems to slow down a bit after a few months
Value for money
I purchased this few month back and still works fine!
"Working fine in my Samsung fridge. Needed to replace the original filter just after 4 months new, but I attribute that to the lines since it was never hooked up to my old fridge. Replaced the filter and the awful noise the fridge makes when dirty / clogged disappeared. working like a charm. Says to replace every 6 months, so far so good.Use original manufactured filters."
When I initially installed the filter I noticed that water was dripping for couple of days and I was concerned that I got the defective filter. I realized that I didn't turn off the water before installing changing the new filter. After couple of days water stopped dripping and filter is just working fine. I am happy with my purchase.
"This filter was placed in my Samsung French Door Refigerator. Approximately six weeks later, when water dispenser was engaged and dispensed water a loud jackhammer sound was coming from the refrigerator.  The same sound could also be heard from the refrigerator when water was dispensed into the ice tray.  A Samsung tech admitted that he had never heard that sound before and $300.00 later we had a new water control valve and the jackhammer sound was gone.  Within one hour after tech left, the jackhammer noise was back. We purchased a Samsung filter from an authorized Samsung dealer and placed the new filter into the refrigerator and the noise ceased and has not reoccurred. I compared the filter I bought from Amazon to the filter from dealer.  I found the Amazon purchased filter has a fuzzy label even though it has Samsung name on it, furthermore, in small letters it was a ""made of Mexico."" And the label had no warranty indication or production run number.  Samsung is a Koran product and so is the Samsung filter that I purchased. I thought I had been diligent in the purchase of a real product of Samsung when I shopped online.  I will not purchase this product from the Amazon merchant again. No stars from this customer."
"Taste great, better than expensive H2o Brands"
"A refrigerator sales person explained there are 2 sizes of water filters for the type of Samsung 3 door refrigerator we bought, a long cylinder and a shorter wider type.  This long cylinder filter fits our Samsung counter-depth refrigerator perfectly.  Super easy to install. Basically unscrew the old one and screw in the new one.  We plan on ordering more of these filters as needed."
I bought this instead of the knockoffs after reading some of their reviews because I didn't want to deal with any problems. Its been in my fridge for almost 6 months now and probably getting to be time to replace it again since we drink a lot of water from our fridge. Have not had a single leak issue with this and no weird tastes or smells from the water...what else is there? It works great.
OPM Replacement for my Samsung Refrigerator.
"I am hoping this filters out what it says it does, but it was sure easy to install.  It said to turn off the water source first, but I didn't need to.  Just turned it to remove the old one, and turned it to secure the new one.  The first one showed a red light on the refrigerator within 6 months."
"These say they are authentic Samsung, but I believe they are not. I tried 3 in my refrigerator, all leaked on the kitchen floor! I called Samsung and they are missing a marking that is supposed to be on the authentic ones. I ordered one directly from Samsung, it was much easier to install, and lo and behold, No Leaking! Similar in price as well. Thanks, Amazon for accepting the return and standing behind the product."
The flavor and quality of the water are top notch!
"Very, very expensive filters. Manufactured by Samsung. I've been purchasing these filters all along but my next purchase will be a filter that WILL fit my refrigerator at a much, much lower price."
"Installed easily, fit perfectly, & seems to be running fine! This is my second purchase for this particular filter & I have not been disappointed! I will continue to purchase them here! Thanks!"
Just what I was looking for
Works great for filtering the water.
Was easy to order. It took me a while to figure out where it was located in the frig.
"I am sticking to the OEM and replacing every 6 months. We live in semi-rural OH surrounded by working farms and a large lake, and there is a clear odor and taste difference between the tap water (public supply) and the filtered water dispensed from our refrigerator. We use filtered water for anything being ingested - water, tea, coffee, brewing beer, cooking and notice  no deterioration in filter performance during the recommended 6-month use cycle."
Excellent value. Good fit for the Samsung side by side refrigerator model.
"The filters were the wrong ones for my refrigerator, even though the serial number, model and all relevant information was given.  I just found out when I tried to use one last week.  What are my options?"
Works well... service to ship as quick in light of the pandemic
Fills the replacement perfectly
Perfect fit for our new Samsung Refrigerator.
"Bought this for my refrigerator and it fits perfectly, directions were easy to follow, and is not too expensive. I will be adding as a subscription now that I know it works for my appliance."
Easy use and no leaks when installing as a replacement for the old one.
Works perfectly
"I realize that all replacement filters are expensive.  These area perfect fit, but pretty costly."
Filter fit right in our fridge and no leaks.
"Our filter has to be replaced every 6 months on our new Samsung.  I don't like having to run water through the filter for a long time after installing it.  Our old refrigerator did not require that. Also have to throw away all ice cubes made after replacement. After that is done,however, the water and ice are nice and clear and taste good."
"This is a legit filter replacement from Samsung.  Only thing that was not described on Amazon was that this is a ""Mineral Water"" filter and not a ""Fresh Water"" filter.  For me, it really had very little impact, because I like mineral water."
Item received as described and in a timely manner.
"DO NOT BUY OTHER BRANDS!!!  The wife bought something other than Samsung because they said it would work and was significantly cheaper.  Sure... it will fit, but next day we woke up to our kitchen being covered in water.  It almost made it to our wood floors in the living room."
"Well, it's a few dollars more than the other 2 generic brands, but it's the real thing and you don't have to worry about issues with fit and form.  My fridge is just an ice fridge, there's no water spout, so I find I only need one of these a year and I don't mind spending the extra couple bucks for the official thing."
This order was fulfilled very quickly without any problems. The three units are replenishing my stock for future use. The price was also very competitive. I did not give it 5 stars because I have not actually used any of the units yet. They are still in sealed packages  so I cannot be sure they are free of defects until they are unpacked and installed.
GREAT PRICE! Does what it's intended to.
Brought for my Samsung frig it works well gets the job done
Most important for me is that it cost much less than from buying one at lowes.
I have tried other brands but they leak.  It is always best to get the original.
"Well, it's a Samsung filter, alright. Made in Mexico from globally sourced components. I only mention that because it's important for me where the stuff is made. Mine came 04/08/2016. Shrink wrapped and everything, however, had a shmuts under the cap, go figure."
"Paid a tad more for the brand name and glad I did. This filter screwed in perfectly, never leaked and I am good to go for another 6 months. No issues whatsoever. You do have to run about a gallon of water thru the filter to get the cloudy water to run clear. After that....perfection!"
Used this product on a camper.
Filters arrived on date promised and are easy to install. Have not experienced any problems with their performance.  They were less expensive on Amazon than the same filter at our local Lowe's or Home Depot.
Does the job
We tried the generic ones and were not pleased with them. Water was slowed to a dribble. These work as they are suppose to.
"The one I received was made in Mexico and the hole was smaller than the original filter that came with the fridge (made in South Korea). This wasn't a problem for me because my fridge doesn't have a water dispenser, only an ice maker."
No problem with installation. Turn off water supply first. You may need some vice-grips or pliers to help you twist and then withdraw  the old filter. This new filter is easy to insert. I would buy again.
Works as expected.
"BEWARE!!!  2/10/2018 installed the filter according to directions.  Did turn water off.  Watched a You Tube.  It is not that hard.  After installed and turned water on little to no water was flowing from dispenser.  Worked with it for several hours.  Overnight water leaked on hardwood floor, went thru to lower level.  Immediately turned water off and set up heaters, dehumidifier and fans.  The big box store that we bought the refrigerator from sold the exact same filter 2/11/2018.  Again same results.  No water.  Monday after many conversations with SAMSUNG (customer no service) a ""TECH"" instructed to just remove the $49.00 filter.  YOU DON""T NEED IT!  Just install a filter on the water line.  Removed filter.  NO LEAK.  Water and ice maker are working fine.  The estimated DAMAGE to the hardwood floor is a mere $6,591.53. (SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY ONE DOLLARS AND 53 CENTS)  The insurance company will be collecting the parts and SAMSUNG just might night like that."
Samsung replacement filter I'll stick with the factory filter till someone proves the off brand really works with no problems.The only thing is they say it should last 6 mons. but I only get about 5 and when the pink light comes on or just before the water does taste not so good. the price on these is good and filters fit and work.
Exactly what I needed to replace my water filter in my Samsung Refrigerator. Easy to install. .
It's the number one filter (best) on the market
Filter was easy to replace. Looks like Samsung original packaging. A little different than the original on model number for stone reason yet it says it's for my fridge. I will update my review if any problems in the future...This is day one!
"-  Rcv'd promptly.-  Item exactly as described.-  Fantastic price (least expensive).  In fact, ordered two b/c the price was cheaper than others multi-packs on a per unit basis.-  No discernible clues to say it's not an OEM part (the skeptic in me always questions); i.e. came shrink wrapped, plastic capped, had inserts (e.g. warranty info, etc), and boxed in seemingly genuine Samsung packaging that would surely be prohibitive for a knock-off to manufacture.-  Installed very simply and quickly."
"Works fine, better flow than the bargain brand filters.  Im glad this filter IS rated to the NSF/ANSI Standard 53 to remove lead - the other cheaper filters are only rated to NSF/ANSI Standard 42 which does NOT remove lead."
Ok
One of my best purchases
"Excellent product , came quickly and very easy to install ! Cheaper products can’t compare ! I will definitely purchase this again! Thanks for making a great product"
"This fit my fridge perfectly and I had no issues with the product.  It came in the company box all sealed up properly.  It installed and performed without any issues.The item is self I feel is 5 stars, but for the price, I find it a bit high so I only gave it 4.I hope this helps someone!"
"The filter came late, did not come at the date that it was mentioned. The filter itself was very easy to install, the taste of the water changed after it was installed.  You have to waste a lot of water though to get rid of the sediments that will form after replacement.  Will order again. And if you are looking at one just order the 3 pack, you will have to change it after 6 months anyways and that's a better deal. I wish I could have done that."
"Item appears to be genuine, as the label is exactly the same as my original filter. The filter I received had the normal size pinhole as opposed to the one in the critical reviews. No leaks and water tastes the same as my previous filter after dumping 3 gallons. Glad to save $10 vs brick and mortar stores."
"This is the factory original filter.  It fits and works fine.I used a few generic filters in the past. Recently I had to replace the entire filter head after a leak from a hairline crack developed.This may be just a coincidence, but I am using the Samsung filters from now on."
"The water filter worked exactly as I expected.  Installation was very easy in my Samsung RF28HFEDBSR.  I did not have to turn off the water supply to the fridge as the instructions recommend and more importantly, I didn't have a leaky mess to clean up afterward.Water tasting great again thanks to my new filter."
Easy to replace and works with our Samsung refrigerator.  I would say that the only problem with these is there will always be a little water in the line when your replace the water filter and you will have to clean it up after you replace the filter.
"Expensive but beats out the cheaper filters by providing far better filtration. If you just want to filter for taste, go for the cheap ones. If you want to filter for healthier water, this is the one to get."
I don’t know if this was an authentic Samsung filter. The water tasted horrible.  I ran at least 20 gallons of water through the filter and the water was still undrinkable.  I had to buy water until I changed the filter.  I finally bought another filter from Lowe’s and the water tastes fine.
"Excellent product  I would buy it again, and recommend it to anyone who's looking for something like this.Works exactly like it should be not much to say about it!  Way too pricey. But the Perfection has its priceGood quality, reliable,easy-to-use!I would recommend to a friend!"
Samsung RefrigeratorSubstitute filter leaked
"I live in Florida where the city water tastes terrible.  I've tried original Samsung cartridges and other after market ones and by far, the original Samsung makes the water taste best."
this is my third time I bought this productit works perfectprice can be cheaper or may be a special price for 2I have to buy this product every 6 monthsI would like special deals for this productI know there are similar products for less money or special deals a lot cheaper but I prefer to use original products
"Most of the after market filters seem to have a problem with leaking according to reviews. This filter is worth about as much as a small bar of gold, but at least I don't come home and have to put on Scuba gear to get into my kitchen."
"I have  a new refrigerator, 6 months old.  So when it lit up to replace the water filter, I was not prepared and rushed down to my local store and bought one and with tax it came to over $48.00.  When I got home and looked on Amazon, since now I knew which type to buy, I couldn't believe it was less than half the price.  So I ordered this one to have on hand the next time I need a filter.  Big savings!"
"I tried a cheaper filter it shut down my water and ice maker. I’ve had no issues with the Samsung filters, which is great."
"I found these on Amazon cheaper than purchasing locally.  The original OEM filters are too expensive to purchase locally and replace every six months.  If you have a large family with kids, you need to switch these filters out every six months.  I change them out every eight months.  Good luck."
good tasking water but opening is very small which reduce water flow. also made my hose shake which drove me crazy. Don't have issue with current filter from competition
"More affordable online than in my local hardware store. Genuine Samsung product. I will purchase them in the 4 pack next time. More bang for the buck! I would not recommend using the knock off product as it voids the warranty.  I mean unless you have lots of wealth, than no worries!"
Good price and I have had problems with after market filters .  Stay with Samsung to avoid leaks.
Samsung refrigerator
I was hoping the real water filter would solve the leaking problem but it doesn't.
We just received these in the mail just in time to replace the filter that is already in the fridge. We searched around and found that this website and dealer sells the filters we need for our Samsung fridge to be cheaper than buying it from the store we bought the fridge from.Thank you!will be purchasing more in the future.
"""No Issues. Second time purchasing from this seller. As I am able to afford upgrading from Arlo to Arlo Pro I will continue to purchase this product.  I am a happy camper! """
I still can’t believe how easy it was to install.
"Easy to install, much than in the stores. Same exact one I've paid double for."
This filter is pricey but not ready to take a chance on an OEM product which is much cheaper. Also suspect the Samsung version is a better filter.
"Fresh water again. Change these out at least once a year if not sooner. We have RO plumbed into the refrigerator so we went 2 years, but I think I'm going to shorten that replacement interval to 1 year."
"This is what fits my refrigerator model, is why I buy it, but I'm very pleased with this filtration system. Water tastes good (which is to say it has no taste, and no after taste). These last quite a while, and we are constantly pulling water out. Good deal on this site."
seems like the filter that came in fridge only lasted around 5.5 months. I use the filtered water in our Samsung fridge many times daily. So that is probably why it went so quickly.This replacement was easy. Soak in water & pop in filter area & shut the door. Easy peasy.Water & ice taste great & didn't have any of that new plastic taste.
"I  first tried to by a discount filter that was supposed to be compatible, which ended up being defective. I don't know if it was just a dud, of if the discount ones don't work as intended. I then gave in and got the Samsung one. It worked perfectly. Pricier, but it worked, so it may not end up saving money buying a knockoff."
"It work for the few weeks but after a month I had to get a newer one, don’t know if this one was different but I have purchase them at Best Buy and the lasted at least 3 months"
The product was easy to install; after changing the filter our refrigerator the water and ice maker works like new
"Looked around for these filters for my refrigerator.  Came in, fit fine and it is working.  Bonus, this is a 2 pack, which I apparently missed when I was ordering, so I have a spare for the next time the filter needs to be changed."
"Going original is probably the way to go.  I went with an after market and the water flow increased quite a bit which made me think the water wasn't getting filtered as well as ""OEM""."
At first we bought the generic version of this water filter and it was not as good. The generic filter had much lower water pressure. It took much longer to fill a glass. As soon as we ordered the real Samsung brand water filter it worked like a charm. The water pressure returned to normal.
Pricey but I trust this more than non-oem filters where the o-ring is hit and miss.Don't want to flood the kitchen
My fridge didn't recognize that the filter had been changed. This could be a problem with the fridge not the filter. The water tastes great.
Ordered this as a replacement filter for our fridge & have not had any issues.  It works great & filters the water nicely where there is a good quality taste.
Much better to buy in 3's. It seems like 6 months will run up on you in a hurry. Having another one of these around comes in handy. No to mention that Amazon is on the ready with 2 day shipping.
Easy to install. Quick delivery.
As advertised as far as I can tell.  Works well after a few months
"The Samsung filters are an EXACT replacement for the original that came with the refrigerator.  These units have a double O-ring which helps distinguish them from other after market units. The price is slightly higher, but the fit and performance is excellent."
"This did the trick. After reading reviews from so many others who had issues and inconsistent results with after market versions, I found it best to just turn to Amazon for the Samsung version for my refrigerator. I did not want to be greeted by a puddle on the floor and be concerned with someone slipping. Just not worth it. I  couldn't find any one else who could beat Amazon's prices either."
"This is a much needed item in my Samsung refrigerator/freezer.  I didn't replace it when needed last time and left it go an extra 2 months and I will never do it again, this must be replaced in the model that I have when the little light turns pink and most definitely red. My water pressure was so low and it stopped making ice cubes, I learned my lesson by not replacing it when needed. Definitely worth the $40 or so dollars it costs."
"I've had my Samsung refrigerator for 2 years.  The 2 filters I got with the refrigerator from the appliance dealer each lasted 6 months as expected.  I bought my first SINGLE filter ""sold by Amazon.com"" and it too worked as expected.  So I bought this 3 pack in December 2016, ""sold by Amazon.com"".  The first filter from this 3 pack lasted Feb-May, ~3 months, then the flow became a trickle. The last two have been changed in 1 month when the water flow dropped significantly.  If I remove the filter and run the water the flow is immediately strong again.  These filters should be lasting 6 months. I spoke to my appliance dealer who said that it is likely that even though Amazon is selling them, they may not be getting the filters from Samsung... and that significantly increases the chance that the filters are generics made to look like genuine filters.  I'm trying a single filter sold by Amazon again.  If it too clogs before 6 months, I'm not going to buy these filters from Amazon anymore."
Worked as expected.  No leaks.  Cost always high for these filters.  I do appreciate it having both NSF 42 and 53 certification.
Muy bien
This was so much cheaper to order from AMAZON instead of purchasing it from the large box store our Fridge was purchased from.Works great & noticed a difference right away after replacing the much overused original.
"As others have stated, this has all sorts of red flags for counterfeit.Red flag #1; Low price. Of course, this is what makes it a great deal, but if we're honest, it's a red flag that it's much cheaper than the competition.Red flag #2; The box I received had clearly been opened.Red flag #3; The plastic body of this filter is a completely different shade of white than the original filter that came with my refrigerator.Red flag #4; The knob on the end of the filter does not sit straight up and down when the filter is properly twisted into place.Red flag #5; This filter sent lots of activated carbon through the water dispenser when I first flushed out the air bubbles. This didn't happen with my original filter.It still appears to function perfectly fine but all of these red flags certainly point to this being a knockoff product."
The replacement filter was made to replace the original one and installed very quick and easily.
"Amazon sells this filter at the best price.  It's about $20 cheaper than buying the exact product at any local retail store.  I tried purchasing an alternate generic brand filter, but it just didn't work the same as the brand name Samsung filter.  Take my advice, spend the extra money and get this filter from Amazon.  It's totally worth it!!!"
Great filter. Easy to install. Fit perfectly. I recommend it.
"We've had trouble with this filter since it arrived.  First, it messed up the electronics board. So the fridge was beeping and switching randomly, on its own, between ice and water setting.  Then, we saw the water came out more slowly.  Now, the water comes out at a very slow trickle.  My husband removed the filter to see if the water still comes out at the same slow rate.  And the water comes out way faster without the filter.  Awful.I spent more on this filter bc it was the ""genuine"" Samsung filter, despite the good reviews on cheaper knockoffs.  I'll take my chances and buy a cheaper one now as this filter is not worth the money"
Less expensive than other retail stores. Took a day to deliver to my door and easy to install.
The big box store that sold the fridge did not have these in stock...Special Order...good grief.
"Great price for these filters; I buy one every 6 to 8 months.Our fridge turns on the filter replacement light every 6 months, but we just watch for a decrease in the flow and replace as needed. I try to wait at least 7 months since the warning light isn't actually considering the quality of the filter.Very easy to swap in a new one."
"We bought the cheaper after market filter and noticed that our fridge made weird gurgling noises throughout the day. The water pressure wasn't that great either. Maybe not a big deal for some, but our water dispenser is inside the fridge and the longer the fridge stays open to fill a cup of water, more cold air is released. Bought the Samsung filter and immediately noticed the quicker water pressure and no gurgling noise. Bought another one right away while the price is still reasonably low."
Refrigerator water filter
"Generally, cheaper by the dozen. We have well water, and these take away the little bit of off taste. We  also confidently use the filtered water for our coffee machine and iron. The only reason for 4 stars is that the price of  filters is outrageous."
"These filters arrived when expected and were a perfect fit for my refrigerator. It was easy to change and there were no leaks. I have filtered water going into my refrigerator, so I only change it annually. I'll buy this again when I need to change it."
Easy to install and delivered quickly
Easy to install filter for Samsung fridge.Up and running in 5 minutes. Good water flow and good taste.
Super easy to install in my samsung fridge. Water is clear and clean. When replacing old one remember to relieve water pressure or it will be hard to remove.
"This was an exact replacement for the filter that I removed from my fridge. Quick delivery, easy to install. Exactly as advertised."
These filters last quite awhile and make both water and ice clear and fresh tasting
"Hard to get old one out and new one in, but that’s because of water pressure. Turn off water and it should be simple."
"Yes the OEM costs more, but it fits better in the fridge.  When you consider you replace these filters about every 6 months, breaking down per month, it is worth it have a filter that works flawless and doesn't rattle in your fridge (after markets are smaller)."
Loved the simplicity of installing
"These are a bit of a hit or miss filters.  I've purchased 8 overall, and 6 worked fine while 2 dramatically reduced the water flow from the refrigerator's water dispenser to a trickle, hence the 4 stars ilo 5.  Not too many options available for Samsung filters."
"Haven't had it in for very long so I can't attest to their longevity but in any case I'm getting 3 for the price I would normally pay for 2, so if they last only 2/3 as long I break even and if they last as long I'm ahead of the game."
"i didnt get the original label as seen here and was worried when i received my item, but I have to say 4 stars at the moment as i only put it in 3 weeks ago...its working just as the original...time will tell on how long it will last..at the moment, i do recommend this product"
Barato y exelente
And if you don't use them they void your warranty.
So excited when I found this item on here!! Originally over $100 in store!! Easy to replace and comes with step by step instructions!!
This item was a perfect fit for my refrigerator. And operate just the way it should.
"Last time I replaced my filter, I went with a knock off, but after some time the water tasted moldy.  So decided to order OEM from Samsung.  Water tastes much better."
Fit as expected
Genuine Samsung filters work beat
It worked for our samsung fridge just fine!
"I thought it wasn't going to go in but it turned out there was just too much pressure build up in the supply line. To avoid water all over the floor, turn off the water supply and empty the line, THEN install it!"
"I can't say this is a great bargain for the price but it's the best price I could find for the OEM filter. It fits perfectly and works great. Others have recommended that you turn off the water supply before changing but I left mine turned on and it spilled a minimal amount of water, easily cleaned up."
Original with verification tag
"The filter is fine, it's the refrigerator that is awful !  I hope I NEVER have to purchase anything else made by Samsung.The refrigerator is the worst I have ever owned, and I have had many."
"Great product...priced too high when compared to other refrigerator water filters.  The filter is very easy to replace and, on our Samsung refrigerator, does not require turning the water off first.  The replace filter indicator on the door's display will automatically reset itself when the filter is replaced making the entire procedure very easy and fast."
Work well.  Get the real samsung  one.  It has a higher NSF rating then any of the generic ones out there.  Also ensures your warranty won’t be voided if you have an issue.
"Expensive but work well in Samsung fridge. Tried the cheaper knock offs but, in the end was not worth it. 1) They don't filter to the same specs as this original one and 2) had lots of quality trouble with the last batch, could not get rid of air bubbles in them, which causes annoying vibration in the water line to the fridge. So why not 5-Stars? well, it's the price... so, will keep looking for alternatives..."
This is the filter for our brand new French door Samsung refrigerator. In itself it's a good filter and does its job however the installation of it by turning off the water pressure can be a pain as well as the cost as usual is really high for these things.
Easy to install.
"Installed this filter and after a few weeks wifey Complained that the bottom tray of the fridge wouldn’t open.  I investigated as directed and discovered there was a 1/2 inch layer of ice covering the bottom most tray of the refrigerator.  Removed the ice and wifey was happy again. A few weeks later received the same complaint and again, found ice in the bottom of the fridge.  This problem occured somewhat coincidentally with installing this so deemed OEM filter so I removed and reseated it.  After several weeks of joy wifey complained and again, I found ice in the bottom of the fridge.  I’m really not interested in hearing more complaints or spending my valuable man time fixing this problem.  I am going to order another filter but not sure from who yet and then see how this goes.  I’ve replaced this filter a couple of times before with no worries.  I hope the new one fixes the problem as I have much more interesting things to do with my time and money!!!"
Easy to install.
"Pros: Works well, lasts a long timeCons: PriceyEven though there are plenty of third-party brands, they don't seem to get high reviews, so I've only been using OEM filters. It's definitely pricey, but since there are no real alternatives, I can't really do much about it. I usually use these filters a bit longer than the manufacturer recommends, and I think it lasts long enough to do so. The water is crisp, clear, and doesn't have much of a taste to it."
Expensive but worth it.... I used some cheaper generics brands before and I can assure the taste of the water it’s definitely worth it!!!
"So far it's working great but we've only had it about a month.  Based on other reviews, I'm holding off on a 5 star rating to see how long it lasts because many said it didn't last more than 2-3 months rather than at least 6 months on the filter from Samsung."
No thank you
"Tried using a generic brand but my refrigerator started making grinding noises.  Hired a repairman to come into the house and paid $65 for his consultation.  Meanwhile, we re-ordered this and replaced the generic filter and no more noise (the generic brand worked before!).  So prices are dropping and we will go back to using Amazon to purchase these filters."
It looks the same as the one that came with my refrigerator.  The hole is big for and the o-rings are nice and snug to prevent leaks.  The 2 pack is the same as the 3 pack.
"This product was easy to order, arrived promptly, was properly packaged, and installed with ease. I think that the refrigerator does not keep track of the filter cleanliness, but instead just waits 6 months and turns on the ""filter needs replacing"" light. The filter works wonderfully; the water from our tap is undrinkable in my estimation; however, the water from the refrigerator (via this filter) is as good as the Arrowhead water that I normally drink. I think the filter is well worth the price."
didn't connect properly at first but I reinstalled and all is ok.These filters all cost too much and need replacement too often  but less expensive thru Amazon.
Make sure to turn off the water first (the water pressure may prevent the filter from locking into place); twist out the old one and then twist this one in.The filter comes with a set of stickers to mark the date when changed- the original filter was in the fridge for 10 months and it did appear to have some mold around the nozzle. I will probably replace my filter every 6 months.Much better price on amazon versus best buy / etc.
Mine came this time Made in Korea.  Last time I bought made in Mexico.
I liked everything about this product!!!
Perfect fit.  Home Depot sells them for more so I thought I would take a chance buying it from Amazon.  My Samsung fridge (french door) is 11 years old and this was a perfect fit. No leaking and the holes and twist top were identical to the more expensive unit I bought last year at HD as a replacement.
Great product worked great with my Samsung fridge not the same as the OEM version of the filter but still works great.
"Worked perfectly and fit perfectly as well. Indicator filter light may have to be reset. Just look at your manual or online.  Mine was just a button. I went with the original manufacturer on this purchase because I spent a lot on the fridge.  Having prime was a plus since our filter alarm went off,  had it in two days. Will buy again!"
"Price was a bargain compared to other outlets. I like having more than one on hand. Mine lasts longer than 6 months, so I'm a happy camper."
Easy to install and makes water taste fresh!
I've been using the brand filter for my Samsung refrigerator since I purchased it almost four years ago. I've been tempted to buy the off-brand ones in an attempt to save a few bucks but every time I research it I find those that had to trash a nonfunctioning or leaking filter. So I've stuck with the more expensive Samsung brand filter and have never had a problem.
"Exact fit for our Samsung fridge. Comes with stickers to allow you to label what month you installed the filter. typically last about 6 months. tight fit in our fridge, you just turn the old filter 90 degrees and pull it out (pulling it out is difficult, o ring is tight fit). Push the new one in and rotate it 90 degrees and the install is complete."
Water taste had an weird after taste
The cartridge was easy to install and as always worked well.
"What else is there to say - it's the OEM filter - arrived in the OEM box, sealed in plastic - installed per normal and gets the job done!"
Works great on my fridge taste good!!
It was so easy to install!
My water is clear. The TDS is low. The water tastes good.
"based on reviews, I was not sure if I was getting a filter that would work or would leak.  I have had it in for 2 months and it has worked perfectly."
"Worked perfectly  for our Samsung. Easy to install. Price was fraction of Home Depot and no poor customer service to worry about.  We read and looked at the videos that said cut all the water off in the house but for us that wasn't necessary, my husband just popped it in and turned. I will order from Amazon again due to quick shipping,ease, and fair price."
"A bit expensive, but fits perfectly and is OEM. Certainly want to keep the water filtered to protect the fridge and us!"
"Good for what it is, pricey but you have to replace the filter!"
Easy check out and delivery. I like the picture options.
"In about two month of use my fridge turned on the red light for 'change filter'. It is supposed to last 300 gallons. We are a family of two and a toddler that hardly consume more than a gallon of water at home per day. Definitely it must have been defected or there is a false advertising claim.For such an expensive original filter, I expect it to deliver on its life span."
Woks great for my fridge
Since it is the Samsung brand it is more expensive. I tried cheaper brands and this for perfectly.
The price for the 3 pack for this expensive Samsung water filter is one of the best available I could find anywhere.  It works perfectly in our new side by side Samsung fridge and the water tastes great.With Amazon's free shipping coupled with a good price makes for a great deal overall.Your biggest bang for your hard earned bucks is to buy the 3 pack. The purchase price for single units or 2 packs is fair at best.
na
I like the OEM filter because it does not ruin my ice production
Easy to install
perfect filter
Product fit my Samsung refrigerator unit.  Mostly easy to install aside from the water that leaks out if you don't  appropriately apply enough pressure to install it correctly the first time.
Good replacement for my Samsung fridge.  Works as intended and fits as it should.  I replace these about once a year.  I have never had any leaks with these myself as others have.
Very easy to install. Fast shipping
works
"I suspect that I was shipped a different product than what I ordered. Unless the printing on the box was changed by the manufacturer, So far I have no problem with it, it works the way it's supposed and had no difficulty installing it. But the cartridge looks different."
"easy to install, do what they are supposed to"
"We buy these consistently a couple of times a year, and they always seem to do their job.  Very pricey, but I'd rather stick with the name-brand."
These are the real thing and manufactured by Samsung. There are many rip offs on the market so be careful. It may cost you a little more but it's worth it to get a genuine filter. You can always rely on the photograph.
Excellent product if you're spending lots of money on your fridge spend the money to buy genuine filters.I got tricked by a company claiming to be the factory wholesalers only to get a generic product I returned got on amazon and got my manufacturer recommended filter.
Refrigerator water filter
Tried different generic filters but water never flowed properly. They would always sputter and spit when dispensing water. Ice maker would always make horrible noises. Went back to original Samsung filters and haven't had a problem.  Worth the extra money to me.
As original the price is higher than other choices.  Fits and does a good filter job
"Item I received seems to be counterfeit.  I compared the new filter against my current filter.  Instead of filtering common substances like lead etc, The new filter lists really strange substances that it ""filters"" from the tap water such as: atenolol (a common blood pressure medication), Fluoxetine (Better known as Prozac, which is an anti-depressant), Ibuprofen (Motrin), Progesterone (female hormone) and Trimethropin (an antibiotic). First, these aren't substances commonly found in our drinking water.  However, I feel who ever made this filter, thinks we as consumers are too stupid to notice something like this.  As a registered nurse, I was shocked that a water filter would list these drugs as items it filters from our tap water.  lol!!  Now, you can understand why I think these filters are fishy and most likely counterfeit.  Prior to purchasing, I read a few reviews that stated the filter they got was counterfeit and now I see and totally agree.  I will stick to purchasing my water filters from Best Buy!  Please see my photo of this phony Samsung water filter."
"I bought this from Amazon directly. I paid higher price for it. But it fits to my refrigerator perfectly just like the way Samsung describe it in their manual. Previously I bought it from other vendors and their filter didn't fit (I couldn't get the arrows to align properly, but they work for like 6 months) properly. I highly recommend this product from Amazon even though it is little bit expensive!"
"We priced this same filter at one of the big box stores and it was $47.00.  Are you kidding?  For a water filter?  We ordered two of these for under $70 delivered and installed the first one about 5 months ago.  It worked great and we only noticed the water getting that tinny taste in the past week or so.  Replaced it with the second filter and, presto!  The water tastes like...well...water again! Good buy!"
"I was pleased this item was available here on Amazon, as it was cheaper than with my ""special 10% discount"" postcard from the store we purchased the refrigerator from.  There was a flier with instructions listed in many languages and it was easy to install and is working just fine.  The first one lasted about 6 months, which in looking at other reviews, is ""normal"".  Seems expensive for a water filter but this is the best place to purchase!"
A+++
"After installing this in my Samsung fridge, the water is extremely murky and do not run clear. This product is not worth the waste of money. Prior to this, I had no issue with the water looking like that."
Received Today great service.  The store in town had been out of them for the last couple of weeks.  Was really glad to have the filter again!Will order next time I need one
No
"Long lasting and does a great job of removing the tase from our town water.  Much better than buying bottled water, this is great to drink and for good ice"
"It was 5 star out of the box because it didn't make the loud noise I was having from cheaper, generic filters. However, after a month the loud noise is back.  The difference is the noise is only occasional and the generic filter was loud every time.  We drink a lot of water so we use our refrigerator very often. So, if you have the loud noise I would recommend switching to this filter, just don't expect it to be perfect."
Fácil de colocar !!!
Great filter worth every penny. I bought an aftermarket filter in attempt to save some money ant it leaked on us in less then a day. The OEM filter not only does an excellent job it gives us peace of mind that we won't come home to a giant puddle on our floor again v
I have used generic filters for my Samsung refrigerator. They didn't work as well. I need genuine Samsung filters in my refrigerator. These were the best price for genuine filters.
"Works great, I will say though read all of the directions, I tried to simply replace the old filter and I could not get this one on, I read further to find out turning the water off to the fridge definitely makes it easier to install the new filter!"
Life is too busy to stop and  buy fridge filters. The convenience of ordering from Amazon is wonderful!
"I purchased the Samsung-branded water filter to replace the original filter in my (fabulous) Samsung refrigerator.  I looked at the YouTube video for instructions, and followed them to the letter.  I uninstalled the old filter and put the new one it.  Easy-peasy.  Then I heard water running - I thought into the filter to push the air out.  Nope.  The filter did not connect properly in the back, even though the lock was properly engaged.  Water all over the floor of the fridge and my kitchen about 2 minutes later.  I took it out, and tried to reinstall it.  Still, water shooshing out.  I put the old filter back in, no problem.  I note as one other reviewer that the intake hole for the water in the replacement filter is much smaller than the original filter.  Perhaps that contributed to the defective seal."
This is the 3rd one I've ordered over the last 2 years and I'm extremely pleased with it.
"Fits good, however the filter bought Jul 2019 looks very different from the filter from 2018 that I had bought using the same link (had reordered the same exact one).2018 filter looks/feels more OEM and made in Mexico. 2019 filter made in Korea looks fake."
You can definitely taste the difference in the water and it's very easy to install
"Fits the fridge properly, works as expected.  Was considering an off-brand cheaper version, but after reading the horror stories of low flow and other issues i decided to just spend a bit more and get the right thing."
It’s hard to get the old filter out to install this filter. But the filter works well as it was designed for the fridge.
"Easy access in front of frig. However, a little difficult to remove & reinsert. It takes a lot of hand strength to unlock 'twist' removal of old filter, same with reinserting new filter. I had to use channel lock pliers"
"These water filters work very well, making the water taste as good as bottled water, with rare exceptions. Expensive, perhaps, but each one yields plenty of filtered water in our Samsung refrigerator. 4.5 Stars."
This is a great price for Samsung replacement filters.  Amazon is $10 -$15 cheaper than retailers for the same filter.  There are off brands you can buy that are $5 -$10 cheaper than this Samsung but I have always used there brand and have never had any issues.  As they say if it aint broke don't fix it. I am already saving money over the retail price so I don't mind paying the extra for the manufacture brand.
I used an non=Samsung Water Filter and it caused my frigde to leak. Service person said to use only a Samsung in my appliance. I bought this one and found that the price was good and it stopped the leaking problem right away!
"Is okay product and the price was not so bad taking into consideration that I got it from Amazon (lowest price I could find). But, water still have some chlorine taste after we changed it and run the water as advised. Fridge filters should really last longer. These are only good for 6 months. I got a fridge that came with it by June 2011. The warning light for filter change came on since November 2011, so it lasted only 5 months. It is also hard to replace because of the water pressure. To make it easy, you have to shut down the water from the back which is a real hassle in my case since the fridge fits very tight in the kitchen fridge space."
Ease to install
Nice filter!
"Pricey, but the right fit."
Ordered what I thought was a Samsung - very hard to fit in. It wasn't genuine Samsung. Ordered this and it was perfect. No leaks that many reviews say come with Samsung compatible filters. I say go genuine...an extra $5 is worth it every 6 months for made to measure and reduce leak risk
I like the fact that it was real simple to install. Right away my water had a better taste. Quit pleased.
Good replacement! Arrived earlier than expected! Good Value
The filter is doing its job.
Perfect replacement. Makes the water taste much better.
Price is good and works well in my Frig. I like to have the name brand for this filter.
"Samsung filter for a Samsung fridge -- perfect fit and operation.  A 3-pack is a nice way to avoid frequent purchases, too."
a bit expensive but I keep buying it because it fits perfect with no leaks
"I was going to buy some of the cheaper off brand filters offered on this site, but decided to stick with the Samsung ones instead.  I looked at the 3 pack, but the singles are cheaper (or were at the time) when you divided out the cost.  It works great, just like it's supposed to.  I drink a lot of water, and more so when my water has NO taste like it's supposed to be.  :)"
"Perfect fit,  for me, it is a little hard to install,  it can work correctly only with the correct position."
Good value
"Easy to install, water tastes clean."
"I ordered this one day and it arrived the next. Good thing, because this new fridge gives no warning before it just decides you need a new filter. I read the reviews before ordering and almost didn't order. But this was exactly what I ordered: a genuine Samsung water filter. Easy out with the old, easy in with the new (with my old fridge, I needed a pliers)."
"I always like to go with the actual Samsung product. I have used the generic ones, but I like the Samsung product better. First off it fits better than the generic ones. Second I feel it filters the water better as well. More expensive but worth the money"
"It's easy to use, lasts a long time, and is great to help with my scar tissue after the second surgery on my hand."
"I chatted online with an agent at Samsung and they told me that this was the correct filter for my fridge. They were wrong, and now I have a filter I can’t return."
"It works well and the water taste great, it however a bit more pricey than the aftermarket filter but I have yet to have any leaks or malfunctions with this OEM filter so I think the product is worth the price."
It’s same as the original
"Some reviews show concerns about these being genuine Samsung. I can confirm that the packaging has changed from prior purchases I have made. Not sure it's actually ""Samsung"" but the quality seems to be as good as the ones I used to get - and the price on these is great: seal is tight and I have had no leaks using 5 of these to date."
Filter worked perfectly with good water flow. I attached a few images from the box outlining the filter claims and an image of the filter port connector since there have been other comments discussing changes to it. But this one was as expected.
"I brought this for my new fridge and it’s taste like hell , we all family suffering of sour throat after get the infection from water . We test water it’s too much sour water. Don’t buy it"
"Since 2016, I’ve ordered these specific Samsung filters directly from the reorder in my cart amazon—unfortunately something has changed and the filters no longer fit. I even checked if a cap was stuck (other users have reported this)—that’s not the issue. Please note the differences in the models.  The model in the right of the pictures (pink x on it) is the working model. They are clearly made differently and it’s visible. If you look closely the working model is imprinted 85-926...and the non working model doesn’t have this. The non working model as AL29 on water filter sticker. Are these counterfeit or has Samsung messed up on their manufacturing?Update: I wrote amazon regarding my concern of fake reviews left my negative review and my concern for those still unknowingly drinking from these counterfeit filters. I hope this will help someone—I went to Lowe’s and purchased an authentic Samsung filter it fits perfectly. Please don’t try to save a couple of bucks—it’s simply not worth your health."
"The price is a lot better than Lowe's, Home Depot or your local appliance store. And this is the EXACT same product as I bought from my local appliance store. There were some people who said it wasn't, but I kept the box from my last one from the appliance store and it was exactly the same, right down to the last letter and where the lot numbers were."
"Spent a little extra to get the genuine parts.  It is interesting to note that they switched from a double ""O"" ring to a single ""O"" ring seal, but I have not detected any water leaks after installing the single O ring replacement."
"Others claim to be NSF certified, but if they don't have the label be suspicious!  There are certain things that are just worth the extra money and piece of mind. The water you drink and cook with is one of those things! Perfect factory fit, no leaks and great tasting water. You get what you pay for."
"This was the factory filter.  There are many after-market non-OEM filters out there.  I tried one.  It didn't work, and may have contributed to a problem with my refrigerator.  This filter was about the same price as the aftermarket one sold at Best Buy.  Arrived in a few days, and worked perfectly.  I'm now enjoying filtered water from my refrigerator again."
"looks different than the original, work great but at the moment the water line makes a noise"
Seems to fit and do the job
Great product and price!
"Worker perfectly, as expected. No issues. Just check that your water line is off behind the refrigerator to avoid the pressure build-up that may cause it to be difficult to remove."
Como remplazo del anterior
"Expensive; but, does a good job."
We don't change our filter when we should as our water is good and we can drink it from the tap. We use the ice maker but pour the water from our tap as it flows faster. Just changed the filter for the first time after 1 year and everything seems fine.
"All of this is my opinion (only stating this for legal reasons):These are counterfeit filters. They say “Genuine Filter” all over (first clue a scam is going on), as a way of tricking you into believing that they are “genuine Samsung”, which they are absolutely not. I’m not using them, not because I’m worried about them ruining the fridge, which others have said they will do, but because I have no clue what kind of toxic waste is inside of these… It says that they are made from “globally sourced components” (aka China). I would rather eat a cyanide pill then drink water that runs through some sort of fraudulent scam filter made it and God knows what kind of disgusting conditions.Think about how much water you drink… do not risk your life with these filters.This is all just my opinion."
as advertised
"Easy install, no leaks, no headaches and worth the money."
I had to buy the factory filters after I had a bad experience with two leaky aftermarket filters. The price is great and the performance is flawless. One thing to note is that the Samsung filters filter more contaminates than the aftermarket brand we had previously purchased.
"Installed new Samsung refrigerator on September 2015.  First filter I replaced 4/16/16 worked great which I ordered on Amazon.  It was the same type filter as the one that came with refrigerator. 5 months later I ordered 2 more using bar code on box from Lowes because the sale price was unbeatable at $30 a piece.  They have not worked well at all.  The UPC, item in box looked almost the same except little differences in construction which other people complained about.  I will now have to call Samsung to see what's going on.  My guess is that Samsung makes their own knock off as most companies do forcing the consumer to buy direct.  I've had issues like this in the past with other products from other companies and one customer service rep even told me that it's true.  That if you want the real deal you have to buy direct.  It's how they make their money and why other places can sell them cheaper."
"Works fine. Be sure to turn off the water to your fridge first. Yes, it's 2017 and turning off water to a fridge before replacing the water filter is still a thing, at least on most fridges."
Love it
"All of this is my opinion:This product is clearly a fraud. I have attached photos that show the inauthenticity.For reference, I have put the new “Samsung” filter (right) next to the one I have been using for over 6 months (left). There are certain essential parts that are lacking on the replacements (namely the authentication tag), so please take caution when buying/using these filters. I did not try running water through them since, given that they failed my visual inspection, I was afraid they could also fail to filter and contain water (something other reviewers have noted).I do not know if this is the case for all of the filters, but the ones I received clearly were not “Genuine water filters” as claimed.Again, this is my opinion."
"Even after Amazon sent a replacement for the first (defective) filter, this second is similarly so slow (compared to other filters I've used) that my whole family avoids drinking filtered water now.  Seriously.  It's advertised as ""0.5 GPM"" (that is, one half gallon per minute), but it takes longer than one minute to fill a single quart jar.  It takes so long that the fridge's internal timer mechanism shuts off the flow before we even get a single quart of water out.  Over repeated measurements and (simple) calculations, this is flowing WELL BELOW 0.25 GPM, and we hate it.Facts: This filter is brand new, fresh from Amazon. It is a replacement for an identical, new filter from Amazon, which suffered the same horrendous flow. The water pressure to our fridge is normal/adequate-- it has not changed.  Other (non-OEM) filters flow at 0.5GPM, with no other change in setup.[If anyone wants, I'm happy to upload any number of (real time) videos of this thing dribbling water into a quart jar.]"
I purchased my replacement water filter for my Samsung Frig. It was was shipped quickly and I am very glad to have fresh clean drinking water.
good price...not sure if 6 months is the right length of time these should last...I bought 11/12/14 & it turn red last week or so...I thought they should last a yr since its only used by 1 person & I also use a Britta filter...after reading all the comments on counterfeits etc. I must say mine works just fine & no chlorine taste but the water outta my faucet is like that also...I'm giving them 3 stars cause I think it should last a year...lol!
Works as it should.
"Water tastes great! I can definitely tell the difference between tap water and filtered. The chlorine smell is so strong when it comes out of tap. I had switched to the cheaper/generic version for a while. Although the other water tasted good too, the Samsung filter provides extra layers of filtration."
"These work great in my Samsung fridge, have ordered 3 times now.  Now if I could only get my fridge to stop being a POS I would be in good shape."
Fits as needed.
I was a bit worried about ordering these because some people have gotten fakes. As far as I can tell these are the real deal. Installation was easy. It's getting the old one out that's hard lol. I can't get a good grip on it so I use pliers to turn it out. At first it leaked after getting water but it has since stopped. So this is a good purchase for me and would recommend them to all.  It's now Feb. 23 and I need to revise my review these things LEAKE ALL THE TIME. I'm constantly moping up water out of my deli tray and under it. Every time I use my water dispenser I end up having to clean up the mess in the tray and under it freezes if you don't.
The Water is really crystal clear
"Installation was easy, product delivered on time, and was exactly the right part."
Refrigerators
"No issues. Easy to install. Though more expensive being the genuine part, I preferred to go with the manufacturer rather than an alternate option. Reviews on the alternates were mixed and for a few dollars more I avoided the risk of damage to my floors if the alternate leaked as reported by many reviewers."
"Very simple to remove old filter and install new one. Simply unscrew by hand. A few drops of water appeared when old filter was removed, but it was not necessary to shut off water supply to refrigerator. The new filter screws in by hand in seconds."
its the same one my refrigerator uses will purchase again
"This filter is defective. Purchased in June 2016 and started using it in August. A mistake of delaying, but I never expected a water filter can be so unreliable. Before this new filter, my old one was working well. But the old one had been in use for a year so I figured that I needed to replace it. When I put in this filter, the water flow was very slow, however I still managed to use it for awhile. Then after only one month, the water flow was totally stopped. I contacted the Samsung customer service number (1-888-891-0696), the call did not go anywhere. The guy just wanted to sell me a service appointment for the ridge, even when I told him that the ridge has been all good. Do not buy this filter.Right now I am in a bad situation in which I do not want to use a third-party filter but at the same time the Samsung one is defective and I do not want to purchase again. What should I do???"
perfect fit and good price
Does it’s job
"Loud noise from the refrigerator when I replaced the filter.  I have had that happen before, but I thought that was when I bought a Samsung knock off filter.  I payed more to get the one from Samsung, but is still not quite when filling up the ice maker or using the water from the door.  If it's going  to be loud then just buy the non Samsung and save the money"
"Just what I needed. I have tried the cheaper version but they tend to leak, leaving a puddle or pool to clean up every few day. Wish it was $5-8 cheaper but I would rather get what works than what's cheap."
"Works, but not a great filter.  Water not as good as through some other filters, but limited options when it's an in-fridge filter like this."
"Usually these are really reliable.  But, odds are  if you buy enough of them you are going to get a bad one.  Well I got a bad one.  There must be something loose inside the filter as from time to time it seems to plug up.  This causes very little water or none at all to pass through the filter.  If you wait a while it works just fine again.  I would hope that the manufacturer would provide a replacement but to make sure that water is always flowing to the ice makers (the refrigerator has two) I have had to buy a new one.  I have never had a problem before and when they work it really makes the water taste better."
"We are pretty much forced into buying this filter, because it's the only one that fits in the fridge.That said, it does the job. I would give it five stars if it cost half as much and lasted a full year instead of 5 to 6 months."
Our light came on to change the filter in our Samsung refrigerator. When I ordered I was wondering how it would fit. When I took the old one out and put the new one in it fit perfectly. It was easy to install and works great
The Samsung filter comes with an authentication tag that verifies it's the real thing. This one failed authentication.  I have ordered from Amazon before with no problem (clearly showing the green bars). I guess not this time. I'm contacting Amazon next. UPDATE: I went through the automated return process easily and added this same comment. I don't know if anyone reads it.  Not sure if I'll try a new order or not (I still need to replace my filter).
Buena calidad
Bought this to replace the filter in my fridge. Works just fine.
these filters were much less expensive than the ones the manufacturer for the same filter.  They work just as well.
"This product is a water filter for a Samsung refrigerator. I am happy with this product because I was able to get a great price, much better than anywhere else!"
"I really like this product. The water that passes through the filter before reaching the water dispenser inside the refrigerator door really tastes fresh and clean, so much so, that I have stopped my water delivery service. My family and I are now drinking filtered water exclusively from the refrigerator, and we all like the clean taste, not to mention the great savings. Samsung makes a great filter at a great value in this tri-pack."
It seems to be working fine. It definitely removes odor.
"DO NOT BUY! This product looks and is labeled like original Samsung water filters. But within 2-3 weeks of installing the first filter, my refrigerator began making a loud knocking noise and water would dispense sporadically. We removed the first filter and replaced with the second only to have the problem return. To try & keep from buying a new fridge, we replaced the pump but the problem persisted. When I went back & read the 1 star reviews, other customers wrote, they had the same problem! I replaced the filter with an original one purchased from Lowe’s & the problem stopped. True Samsung filters have an authentication strip to test filters."
Same exact product and brand i bought at an Appliance store.  Saved me $40 ordering online.  Will continue to order this as long as the brand stays the same.  Have never had a problem with this brand and would recommend it.
I bought generic brands prior to purchasing these genuine Samsung water filters and totally regretted it! These kept the water tasting great for my household for over a year! Will definitely purchase these again!
Very happy
"Product arrived in brand new condition with no noticeable defects. Installation was simply and straightforward although the right-side door on our refrigerator does have to be fully opened as the filter is at the very bottom right corner; this could be problematic for people without adequate space on the right side. Regardless, it does what it's supposed to do and I have no complaints."
"This is the only product that works with my ice maker.  Avoid the generic version like the plague.  They will work initially, but will eventually fail and potentially cause a leak.  Do not try to save money- it's not worth it in the long run.  This is also prices very well."
This works perfectly for my Samsung water filter.
ConvenientCompetitive pricing
"The first time around I gave this filter 5 stars. It fit the fridge well and did not give us any problems. But it only sent to work for three months before the the water stream became barely a trickle. Now I know from previous experience that a refrigerator filter is supposed to last at least six months. I bought another one of these, thinking maybe I got a dud the first time around. But the same thing happened. I bought my current filter from Walmart because they are an authorized distributor of Samsung products. When compared the two filters - obvious differences can be noted in the color; text placement; AND most importantly, the new one says it's made by Samsung, while the other one is not. There! I plan to contact Amazon as well, to point this out to them."
It works great. The price is high to me. Cost $14.00 more that last time I ordered on Amazon. But it's still cheaper than Loews and the Home depo
I purchase this item even tho it is a bit pricey - 101% sure that we will not have issues.  have tried cheaper brands and been disappointed
"After purchasing a knock off universal brand, that leaked water all over my kitchen. I ended up buying these. These definitely worked better since these are name brand. I definitely suggest buying name brand when it comes to refrigerator water filters. These were also a lot cheaper than my local home improvement store."
"Nothing to complain, except the cost, but worth it. This filters out so many chemicals and pesticides and hormones. Cheaper ones out there don't. Make sure you read the fine print when you are buying cheaper cartridges."
"Expensive but comprehensively filters impurities. It also fits, unlike some counterfeit versions. As to longevity, only time will tell."
"Came in fast, and it does its job, no complaints here"
makes water taste like water
"WORKED GREAT. I THOUGHT THE FILTERS SHOULD LAST LONGER, BUT LAST ABOUT 4-5 MONTHS WITH NORMAL USAGE. GOOD PRICE. GOOD PRODUCT. FIT RIGHT IN THE SAMSUNG 2012 STAINLESS-STEEL 30 CU FT REFRIGERATOR, EVEN THOUGH THE STOCK NUMBER WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE OWNERS MANUAL SAID IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. BUT. IT WORKED FINE. SO THAT MEANT THAT THE OWNERS MANUAL WAS WRONG, AND AMAZON WAS RIGHT. I WOULD, AND PROBABLY WILL, BUY IT AGAIN."
"Used as a periodic replacement, not because there was a problem"
"These have worked better than a no-name brand. They maybe the same identical but, we had a leak problem and it seems the Samsung is justa little tighter. It stopped the leak."
Great value! Works as stated. Used in my Samsung refrigerator.
Have been buying this Samsung filter for my refrigerator.  It does what it is supposed to do.  Very happy with it.
"Works great, fits tight. Water tastes good.Pack of 3 economical."
very good
Love that it came in a package of 3! Fits perfectly.
Bought this filter on  Amazon Wayer and ice taste good.
Value should be better
El agua es excelente y es fabricado en sur corea
Cost less than in store where I purchased refrigerator.
"sThe product works well and after ordering it more than once I have no problems.  However, I do think it is slightly overpriced."
So far so good. Working just as it should. Came in authentic packaging and even included stickers to put on the filter to show when it needs to be replaced again.
"Nothing like the original. Fit and works perfectly. I had previously ordered a knock-off replacement filter but on delivery, found out that it was made in China and I was concerned about purity of manufactured components since this was used for drinking water and ice."
"This is the way to go,  got it for my frig."
"I could not find the right filter at my local Lowes where I bought my fridge, so I jumped on Amazon and here it is. Works great and at a great price and fits my Samsung like its expected. I will be buying from here for now on."
I originally couldn't install the filter. Then I READ the directions. Turn the water off and drain the line. The filter then goes in easily. Will NOT be returning the filter for refund.
"I'm glad that we can finally go back to making ice that we can use for our drinks, instead of buying bags of ice."
Wonderful product I buy every year
Easy to install. You really don't even have to shut the water off. This filter is an exact replacement and is installed in under two minutes. The only odd thing is the pricing. You can buy it as a single unit or you can buy a package of two. It is cheaper if you buy two of the single units. That always seems very strange to me.
This water filter was easy to install.  Works perfectly as a replacement for our Samsung refrigerator water filter.  Couldn't be happier with it!  Wish it was cheaper.
"Product is as described however these filters don't filter much! If you have a ppm reader you'll see that even with a new filter you still get readings of about 130-150ppm in the water. I've been spoiled using my zero water pitcher that reads zero ppm after filtration. Was definitely expecting a better product for such an expensive filter, that goes into an expensive refrigerator."
"I think the filters I received were defective or poorly manufactured.  Once installed, I had good water flow for only 2-3 weeks and then the water flow dropped dramatically.  Since the water flow was strong to start with, this tells me that water pressure to the refrigerator is good.  I don't think this is a problem with the water itself, as I live in northern California and the water is clean (no dissolved solids, smell, etc.).  Also, the original Samsung filter that came with the refrigerator lasted for more than six months before water flow became constricted, which again indicates to me that this is not a problem with the water supply.NOTE: I JUST REALIZED (FROM OTHER REVIEWS) THAT THE WATER DISPENSER WILL WORK WITHOUT A FILTER INSTALLED (I had assumed a filter was required).  With the filter removed the water flow appears strong.  I am going to try using the dispenser without a filter and save myself the hassle.  I will lose the benefit of filtration, but since our water is clean, I think this may be a good solution."
They do work well but you pay the price for it.  Lost a star just because of the cost.
The filter is great.  I had bad experience with other brands that indicates their filter will work on Samsung refrigerator.
Very easy to install up and running in no time
Recently replaced the filter to my Samsung french door refrigerator with no issues.  Make sure to turn the water to the house or refrigerator off first...then dispense the remaining water from the refrigerator.
The replacement filter fit like a glove in our French door Samsung refrigerator.  The filter was primed by draining off 3 gallons of water. Reset the filter indicator and the water has been flowing just fine like before. It may be cheaper to go for after market filters but some reviewers talked about issues and hence I stuck to buying the original.
The Samsung filter is the way to go. I don't like to spend a lot of money on these filters and I tried and off name brand but it leaked. I was lucky I did not get home to a flooded kitchen. The price at Amazon when I purchased it was lower than at Best Buy. The item arrived as expected.
"Replaced 2 weeks ago, so far has been a perfect replacement. Follow instructions and can't go wrong. Only docked 1 start because the price is so much higher than the generic replacement filters."
Works as instructed
These filters are as described.  I had to chat with a representive from Samsung to know if this was the correct filter.  It is easy to change.  Came well packaged.  Matched the description.  Would purchase again.
"I buy these for my Samsun fridge.  There are other less expensive off brands but none of them provide a detail description of the toxins they remove, so I have to assume that a lack of a descriiption from the off-brands means they do not work as well as these.  For the $20 difference, I'd rather not take that risk and end up with bad water for my famly and I."
"Perfect fit and easy installation.  I know it says to turn the water off before you replace the water filter, but like any other man i just pulled the old one out and put the new one in before my wife was able to get that far into the instructions. No problems and water was flowing again in seconds with no leaks or drips.We are enjoying out refreshing filtered water again."
"We just purchased this filter for our Samsung refrigerator and the new filter appears different from the previous ones we've ordered over the past 3 years.The center hole is smaller in diameter compared to the original filter, the top of the filter is also rounded rather than cut at an angle (see photo with old filter on the left and new one on the right), and the new filter didn't come with the usual monthly reminder stickers that came previously.The main issue is that unlike the old filters, this new filter leaks!  After installing it, we found a puddle of water on our floor the next morning which never occurred with the previous Samsung filters.  Amazon sent us a replacement, but the new one is the same as the first leaky one we just ordered, so we'll need to return that as well."
Samsung filter.  Easy install.  Works as expected.
"If you don't want to struggle with the replacement, get genuine Samsung filters they are worth the extra cost."
"This is an excellent purchase for my Samsung French two door side by side refrigerator.  It is easy to remove and replace, and I have had no problems with leakage.  This is a great product that significantly improves the quality of my tap water.  I will definitely purchase this again when needed"
"==I TRIED ANOTHER BRAND OF IN REFRIDGERATOR WATER FILTERS AND THE RESULTS WERE VERY, VERY POOR==FROM NOW ON I WILL PURCHASE ONLY THE SAMSUNG ORIGINAL WATER FILTERS==IT MAKES FOR A REALLY GOOD SWEET TASTING FILTERED WATER==IT TAKES OUT THAT TERRIBLE CHLORINE SMELL AND TASTE--A GOOD THING FOR MY WIFE A, JEANNIE AND I=="
As described
Much better than the knock version for flow rate. Never going back to the Home Depot version as a result.
❤️❤️❤️
Great value for the money
"Fits perfectly, glad I got the right one, and price slightly less than in store.  Comes fairly quickly, so great to order and not have to try and find it in the store.  Recommend buying 2, so by the time you use the second one, can order more."
"Seems to filter water very well, always tastes good. Probably cheaper than a Brita and you don't need to deal with a pitcher in your fridge. While this filter is nice, can't say I'm very happy with the quality of Samsung refrigerators though!"
This is the replacement filter that I needed for my refrigerator. It works great. Easy to install. Great price.
works better then the off brands
Updated review: The filter works as expected. I had initially thought that the filter light would automatically turn blue but later found out that it actually requires a manual reset (in my case by holding the Alarm button for three seconds did it). Changed the rating to 4 stars.
"20% Cheaper than at Lowes.  A good way to tell if it's doing what it's supposed to.  Fill a cup with tap water and a cup full of filtered water.  Let them sit for 24-48 hours. Smell and taste.  Tap will probably smell and taste like chlorine.  But in reality, it's all a scam for the company to keep us buying there products.  oh well."
ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN GOOD SHAPE.  THIS IS THE ONLY FILTER I USE BECAUSE IT FILTERS MOST PARASITES AND HEAVY METALS.  ALSO THEY DO NOT LEAK WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I TRIED THE CHEAPER KNOCK-OFFS
"I when to Home Depot and asked the guy for the filter replacement, he told they don't have the original but Samsung will always ask for the original only because they want to sell it.. that's BS.. the replacement was bad, the water was really bad and it was leaking. I installed this and no issues, works great, water is good."
"Like almost everything Samsung I've purchased, it's a good quality product. You can never go wrong using the manufacturers recommended parts or accessories."
"It works fine for the refrigerator.  My water tastes ok without it, but as much as you pay for a refrigerator, you want to make sure it lasts, so I got it, anyway.  Easy to change, even for me, who is not gifted in assembly."
Excelente producto
This is my third installation of the Samsung water filter. It installs quickly and easily and lasts 6 months. I would have given it 5 out of 5 stars but the price is high and has gone up about 18% in the last year. It may be worth buying the multipack for that reason.
Good price
"Fits perfect, lasts for us about 5 months. Good filter"
"Refrigerator water filters.  Samsung.  Use an buy all the time.  Cheaper an work , an last good.  THANK U"
They are good quality filters and are considered original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts. Cheaper filters don’t work so spring for the extra bucks.
"Genuine brand products for Refrigerator's I have always had better luck with then off brand. These work great, longevity very good, since I have athletes in the home and lots of water, ice constantly being used."
Doesn't work as well as the one that came with the refrigerator.  I guess it is what it is.  The information sent with the refrigerator says if you use a replacement filter it voids any warranty you may have had.  Before there was no residue in the water in the replacement there is stuff floating in the water now when I get it from the refrigerator and so back to a separate filter.
"Samsung DA29-00020B Refrigerator Water Filter:I do a lot of price checking to see where I'll get the best price and shipping deals.  Found it here, it fits the fridge, it works and is easy to install.  The only thing I'm never quite sure of is how to dispose of the old ones.  It arrived quickly, it gets the job done and that about sums it up!"
This product is compatible with my Samsung refrigerator. It is easy to install and we have no problems with it! Great Value.
After two failed generic filter attempts where there was leaking from my Samsung fridge finally ended after a few days and bought this Brand filter! There is a difference between brand CS generic filters and worth paying more avoid water damage.
I thought this was a real Samsung filter.  I installed and my fridge is messed up. I’ve drained maybe 2 gallons of water and it still coming out cloudy. This isn’t filtering at all and now the water doesn’t come out the way it did before.  It’s more of a sporadic flow.
"The filter works as advertised, it is just ridiculous that you are paying this much for such a simple piece of plastic and filtering medium."
"Works like the new one that came with the new fridge, not much to say as it is the OE ( Original Equipment).No leaks like other generic brands, and no particles in the water with this one.  After you first install, I usually fill up about 2 gallons( so it flushes and particles) and water my plants with this water so It does not get wasted, then it's ready to drink after."
Good
"These are THE Samsung filters. Do not buy the knock offs - they are much cheaper, but you get what you pay for. The knock offs do not filter everything these do , like lead. Be kind to your family."
"Real thing, works better than knock-offs"
Loved the detailed description of this Genuine SAMSUNG replacement item.  Beware there are many copy cats out  there even with the color of the packaging.  This is an honest straight forward dealer I will order from again.
We should have purchased this prior to purchasing an off brand one. We will only buy Samsung for now on since they don't leak as the off brand did and the water comes out tasting as it should compared to the off brands.
Was a perfect replacement for almost half the cost.
Good
This went in our fridge perfectly and works great.
Purchased the Samsung Refrigerator in December.  This is my first order for the water filter.  It fit in easily and is working well.
"It is generally OK as it fit my fridge. However, the item I ordered had a different Replacement ID and it would have been good to be notified that I am not getting the exact specification I requested. The main item is that this version of the item does not filter out medication out of the water stream, which is why I liked the original one anyway. Will try Sears the next time."
Works like a charm and was easy to install
A bit expensive but over all good product
As others have stated these are not the correct filters and could end up breaking your appliance. I read the other reviews and was hoping they might just be bad reviews or false claims that people were receiving fakes... but I could tell right off the bat that this was a fake. It's like a quarter of the weight of the true one. Very sad that Amazon allows this.
"Good filters, they protect from a lot of contaminants."
"Easy to install, refrigerator good for another 6 months"
I tried one of the bargain brand filters and my water tasted terrible. After replacing it with one of these original Samsung filters the water is back to tasting great. I still won't give it five stars though because it does not filter fluoride and Samsung does not make a filter that does.
"Excellent product, exact fit, and does not leak"
The only problem I see is the cost.
"Our filter recently needed to be replaced so we went to local stores and found them to be pretty expensive. I was quite pleased with the price when I found this filter here. It was quick and easy to install, didn't even need to turn off the water line."
As usual Amazon had the best price for these water filters.Be mindful and order the individual item in larger quantities if you want more than 1.  The double or triple pack will run you about a dollar more.Ordered and within a few days received both filters (ordered single item x2)  Same packaging since it was in the same order.Couldn't ask for anything but a lower price.
"The filter we received was a real OEM Samsung filter, not a knockoff.  This price is considerably cheaper than other stores.  Also, we have not experienced any issues with the water quality.  So far so good."
This is the Samsung OEM filter.  The installation and preparing for first use was easy as per the instructions.  No problems so far.  Just remember to run the recommended 5-6 gallons through the system first. If you don't there may be air in the lines and may cause problems with the ice maker or dispenser.
"How else do you review a water filter?  It fit my brand new samsung fridge, looks exactly like the OEM filter that came with the fridge and is providing us with excellent tasting water even past the 6 months recommend change date.  I have found that these filters can usually be used twice before you notice the minerals or chlorine taste coming back into the water."
"Water comes out as drips, not a steady stream. Barely good up I've machine. Bought this Samsung filter after trying some cheap off-brand filters, and it's just as bad as the off-brand. Wondering if I broke something, or it's just not good. I really miss filling up my giant water bottle in 30 seconds. It would take 30 minutes to do that now. Sad."
"Prior to buying this filter, I was using the generic filters which were cheaper. I now know why they were cheaper. The Samsung filters filter more impurities out of the water and for some reason, the water flow from my frig is faster. I'll spend the extra money on these."
I like the price. I cannot buy my refrigerator filter for this price locally
Used for refrigerator filter systrm.  Very pleased.
Convenient shopping
"Good price, better than paying $50 at the store. Samsung fridge water in general isn't so great though. Slow flow. They need to improve their design and water flow."
This is the same filter as the one I pulled out of our Samsung unit.  It works as intended and install is simple.  I've never had a leak with this filter and have heard it's possible with the cheaper filters.  I'm willing to spend a little more for peace of mind.  I only have to change this filter every 8 months or so.
Used to filter the refrigerator water.  Good job.
"This is an actual Samsung filter. I'm not sure what is going on with the pricing at this site, but it does seem to vary. When I purchased this 2 pack, it was a much better deal than getting the filter at a big box store. We're very happy to have saved money and gotten the name brand filter."
"Installs easily BUT the water tasted horrible the first day.  Be sure to run a couple of gallons, maybe more, through it to achieve normal tasting water."
"oem filter, arrived super fast"
Just letting you know that this is a genuine Samsung Part.  It was delivered well before the expected date and works exactly as designed.
Great
Pricey but does the trick. Water tastes great - no flavor of chemicals which is a problem in the cheaper options.
Like the convenience of ordering by mail.
"Great product at reasonable price - bought 3 boxes total of 3-pack.  Should last us at least a year or so, it's nice to have several extra as back-up in case if one fails or doesn't last long as suppose to.  Water tastes excellent, best after dumping several gallons of water when installed the new filter in."
"A note to anyone with a built in refrigerator filter, most of the lights are set on a TIMER not for gallons of water, so you might be able to just reset the filter light and get another few months out of it. This filter is not the same as the original one. works ok."
tired using aftermarket filters and the water dispenser would not work properly. while i do not think the original equipment is worth the cost the 5% discount and automatic delivery takes some of the sting out and the refrigerator works as it was designed to with this filter.
I use it on my refrigerator
We’ve been using these since 2015 and haven’t had any issues. Water tastes great and they’re easy to install.
"I purchased this filter in July to replace the original filter that came when I purchased my Family Hub fridge. I waited until August to replace it and it seemed to be working fine. In October, my water started trickling out of my dispenser, taking 2 minutes to fill a 16 oz glass. I finally called the Samsung help line, who walked me through troubleshooting, only to find that this new replacement filter was causing the problem. It didn't occur to me that this could be the issue, since it is new and the correct, official Samsung filter. I had to go to a local store to buy a new one last night. Now, I've spent $90 to replace this filter and it's too late to return this piece of junk. Glad some of you lucked out and got a good one, but I won't be making this mistake again."
"Easy to install, fits perfectly and works great!"
The right filter for the refrigerator
Have ordered this before.  Works as expected.
Box looked like it took a beating. Other than that the filter seems to be working fine. Pay more attention to the package before shipping to avoid discouraging customers to buy again. Picture doesn't capture the damaged box as how I see it.
Installs and works as it should... not a cheap filter by any stretch.
Very expensive....... Not sure I will buy again....... May go aftermarket next time
It does it's job.  Clean fresh tasting water and no issues with clogs or leaks.  I have it now set to recurring subscribe and save to get a new filter every 6 months
"I have purchased these Samsung water Filters several times before and have always been satisfied with their fit, performance, and full six months of service.  It's possible that some of the compatible filters work as well, but why take chances, especially when the price differential is so small.  That's why I always buy the original Samsung OEM filters.  Stick with the ones that work."
"Didn't want to mess around with generic, so bought this OEM product. Learned to shut off the water line before installing, as it made it much easier."
"Plug and drink! No leaks, taste great."
Ok
Met requirements and arrived promptly.
"Worked for my fridge. Still working. Had no issue installing. I didn't even turn off the water to my fridge. Water leaked only out of the old filter after removal. The fridge literally had hiccups after the new filter was installed. Just like it says, let about 2 gal run thru new filter and the air pockets should be out."
Fit as expected. No problems yet. These are the aqua pure filters that eliminate more things from your water than the standard ones. That was hard to find in the description. Got the genuine product because honestly didn't want to have to deal with 3rd party not fitting properly.
Great price! At least 10.00 cheaper than Home Depot!
"I was afraid of buying ""generic"" filters after reading horror stories about them leaking and/or not fitting right in my fridge.  These seem to work well and haven't leaked."
"These aren't the cheapest, but it didn't leak.  I had a more difficult time getting it installed."
"What to say, is the original Samsung filter and it fits in. Not sure I can say more since I am. Ot testing my water in any way..."
This is my 2nd purchase for this filter. Been happy with it everytime.
"Filter does not have the Authentication Tag from the factory.  The filter is a close resemblance, but it leaked.  I would not recommend this filter and find one with the Authentication Tag."
Just what I needed for our refrigerator.  The light had gone one saying we needed a new filter.  We looked online and this was the best place to buy it--comparable cost and much quicker delivery.
Great for the price convenient for me since I can’t get out of the house on my own great money value
"Works as it should, easy to install."
Excellent.
I tried an off brand filter once.  The water from the fridge was so bad I couldn't drink it.  This filter is definitely worth the price.  I will never buy a knock off again.
Cheaper than buying straight from Samsung.
This product performs as expected.  The water tastes great and the price is better than buying at the store
"I bought a few of these for my Samsung refrigerator.  I noticed the Supco brand would work but I thought otherwise and decided to stick with the OEM brand.  One think to check prior to hitting add to card is to check the price differences between the 1, 2 or 3 packs.  Sometimes it is cheaper to buy three single-packs than one 3-pack."
"Really, what more can you say about a refrigerator water filter?  I do like that it is easy to change in our model.  The filter is located inside the top doors for easy access as opposed to at the bottom of the fridge.  The 2 pack was cheaper than buying individually and cheaper than the 3 pack.  Not sure why."
I used 2 of these on my Samsung side by side and both leaked. Will go to Lowes or Home Depot and pay the extra few $'s to get the quality you need (No Leaks)
"for the price, the cheapest I could find.  easy to remove and replace. lasts 6 months."
It’s a refrigerator water filter. What’s not to like
Great value vs going to department store
"It's expensive. It works better than any replica, so I keep buying them."
"I have purchased ""No-Name"" replacement filters in the past in order to to save a couple of dollars but have found that they only work MOST of the time. The only way to truly know that I will have a filter that will fit but won't leak is to buy the manufacturer's replacement filter!"
"The price is a bit much, but it certainly does its job."
"hey, it's a filter and the dang fridge timer won't go off unless you reset it. the filter will get clogged eventually so you might as well change it...water flows better with a new one indicating that the original filter was a bit plugged...nothing like a good drink of water..."
"These filters do a fine job, I cannot really tell a difference between these and the 3rd party filters. The price and scarcity of these is absurd and Samsung should really work on not gauging customers since they make these at a dime a dozen."
"Good value, much cheaper than name brand, works just as well"
"Filters well, just wish it would last longer."
Arrived quickly and was easy to install
Good
Arrived quickly and as described.
Our Ice Maker would stop making Ice periodically with the generic water filter.  We replaced the Water Filter with the Samsung brand and now I don't have any more problems with our Ice Maker.  We love the fridge and the sale at Home Depot was unbeatable.
"It's a water filter that's easy to install, works flawlessly and tells you when to change it.Can't ask for much more.Been using for several years. Never an issue, never any that didn't last as long as they should."
Price was very high
"its fits easy, good water flow, non flavors"
This water filter works exactly as expected.  I have read lots of reviews from others that purchase different brands in hopes of saving a few bucks.  I'm glad I didn't go that route.  This is the 3rd time I've purchased these and they have always been issue free.  I'd would definitely purchase this water filter again.
"I tried the generic brand for my fridge because it was considerably less expensive, but went back to the Samsung brand.  Much better water quality.  I also noticed with the generic brand it would limit the flow of water from the fridge.  Stick with Samsung!"
"Buy in bulk, as it's a little cheaper.  The Samsung filters work the best, and the water where I live is almost undrinkable without filtering the water."
"Exact same filter that came with my Samsung fridge. Made in Korea and it cost $15 more than the knockoff ""Superco"" made in China brand.I don't know about you, but $15 is a small price to pay for peace of mind. I try not to buy any consumption item that is made in China, especially something I am running my drinking water through."
"I cant say that I love it after all it's a filter, however it was what I needed and it was easy to sit at home and in one click, have it on it's way to my home."
"Worked perfectly for my Samsung model # RFG297HDWP 29 cu. ft. Bottom-Freezer Refrigerator!  Turn off the water, Drain line with cup in the door to releive the pressure in the line, unlock and pop out old filter, slide in new filter and lock in place, turn on water, check for leaks(none for me!)  Run about a gallon of water through the filter before drinking!"
"I have purchased this filter in the past and it seemed to be a genuine filter.  This time I received one that seemed like a knockoff.  Something in the internal workings or the seal allowed it to fill up with air between uses, so when you went to get water (or the ice maker drew water) the refrigerator would make a banging noise for the first few seconds.I went to Lowes and purchased a Samsung filter (same model #, etc) and it is working with no noise."
"Work great! don't buy the cheap knock offs! I almost ruined my kitchen floor (hardwood) as the off brand ones leaked all over my fridge and on to the floor. They are worth the extra money, believe me!"
The filter works well. Just wish it would last longer than 6 months.
What a great water filter! Water tastes mountain spring fresh. No smells to water or sediment
Fits perfectly. Easy to install. Water taste great.
"I does what it is supposed to do. The water tastes much better with the filter but it gets only 3 stars because of the price. I think $100/year is expensive for a water filter - especially when we are filtering city water. In the future, I might switch to a Brita filter pitcher."
Bought cheaper brand they didn’t work well sticking with Samsung product
I will buy from this vendor again!
Just what I ordered.  Perfect replacement for the original filter that came with the refrigerator.
works the way it's supposed too.
Fits perfect but it did not solve the issue my refrigerator is having.  Stay away from the aftermarket versions and stick with the Samsung version.  The real McCoy!!
"I am just giving this product three stars because it does the job of filtering the water, but the price is high.  I just wished there were some same sized generic filters that could do the same without the high price tag.  I sometimes used a generic alternative, that even though they fit into the filter slot they were smaller than this Samsung one, and therefore, vibrated every time water was dispensed, making a bothersome rattling."
"Those who wanted to buy water filter, my recommendation is to get the original part, especially for the Samsung water filter. The water quality you get is better from the original part. The generic water filter does not taste right, and water does not come out as much. That's my opinion."
Easy and does exactly how it's supposed to operate.
"Expensive, but worth it.  I tried to cheap out and go with off brands, but 2 out of 3 leaked.  These sealed the first time."
"Amazon may let me post this one: Have been trying to post this review for the third time. The filter I received from the seller is NOT genuine, poor plastic packaging and cap was not fitted to filter as Samsung genuine filters. I went to Best Buy and purchased a brand new one and it looked and felt genuine .. I dare Amazon to post this review!!!"
"This fit our fridge without any issue.  As stated in the install instructions, turn the water off first.  There will still be a little water that comes out even after shutting off the water. Be sure to have a towel handy.We have really hard water and this filter works well at removing weird tastes."
"I've tried three off-brand versions, and my fridge hates them all.  For one, they don't filter as much stuff, and second, they all caused an awful noise that I could only describe as mechanical flatulence.  These aren't cheap, but there's a reason."
A little difficult to put in; but filters the water fine.
"Found this 3 pack online at a whole lot cheaper than purchasing them in the single cartages. They are the same filter that you get from Sears (the only place I found the cartages in town), but at faction of the cost. So, why am I paying $$$$ for the same thing that's $$. I totally get we need to keep those store workers employed, but ouch!"
"Yes, there are cheaper ones out there, but the cheaper ones only do NSF 42, which is taste/smell. These Samsung filters do 42 AND 53. Why is NSF 53 important? NSF 53 reduces health-related contaminants such as cryptosporidium, lead, VOCs, and asbestos."
Great product I like the fact that I can just hit one button to re order every six months!
worked just like ones from factory
Works great.
decide if you want original or copies
"this item arrived on time, it fits perfectly. and it works fine."
So easy to install. Convenient way 5o buy at Amazon instead of going to the stores.
"As much as I hate the price on these filters, I love the fact that they actually do a good job of filtering. A lot of the cheaper off brands are pretty much worthless."
As expected!
"The item was exactly as ordered and delivered very quickly.  Since it was original equipment replacement, the fit was perfect.  For others who buy this, when you go to replace this and you have trouble twisting the old one to get it out or pushing the new one in, try turning you ice maker water supply off at the source (usually under the sink) to relieve the pressure."
"Nice product, works well. Easy to install"
Works well
I purchased two filters for just a little over the cost of one filter at a local retailer.  We have a new Samsung refrigerator with the ice maker and water dispenser in the door and ned to replace the filter about every 6 months.  I was very satisfied with the price.
"I dont know how you review a water filter. I pulled out the one I had in the frige, checked the part number... booms Amazon has it, few days later I get it and put it in. Turn the water off to your frige to install it will be easier. Other than that it works perfectly fine and i really haven't had any issues."
Water tastes great from my Samsung refrigerator using this filter.  Super easy to change.  I reset it and every six months when the filter light turns red I reorder from Amazon.  It could probably last longer I imagine.
I was in a hurry and I should’ve waited before I submit.  The product is great.
Required water filter by samsung
I did not have good luck with using a generic filter. I will be sticking with the recommended brand from now on.
This is a great filter for my fridge. Cleaned the water well and lasted just over 6 months without any issues or leakage. Ordering more for sure.
I like that it was quick and easy to change.  The water was so clear and delicious. I will recommend this authentic brand to everyone.Great job Samsung.
Manufacture suggested so I stick with it. Don’t want to void my warranty by buying a knock off.
Nice
"I have subscribed on this product for years. Though sometimes the price are higher than one-time purchase, I kept my subscription for convenience. However, the last filter I received from this seller ruined the entire water line of my fridge. Not only the water but entire ice maker smelled stink. The bad smell went away when removing the filter, so it's 100% caused by this product. I also did some research online, and tried to reinstalled the filter for many times, but the fact was no matter how I tried, the water line got bad smell when the filter was on. Finally I bought a new fridge and got rid of the Samsung one. By the way, we also owned a Samsung washer that's on recall order. Nightmare experience and hopefully no more Samsung product in my life."
Taste is good and no problems leaking or anything. Will buy again.
Water tastes great easy to install.
"Good quality filter, easy to install."
"Found cheaper on amazon than if I ordered from Samsung directly. Same filter and easy to install, saved a few bucks too."
I can't tell the difference between filtered and unfiltered water but my wife thinks the filter prevents health problems. She only has 1 kidney so wants to limit introducing impurities into her digestive system.
The discretion said these would fit my Samsung fridge.. they do not. They’re not even the correct shape.
"We had the old filter for way too long (12 months). When my wife started to complain about the water taste being a little off, I ordered this filter.I did consider the generic ones, but I just thought too much is at stake. This is the water we drink every day.The filter, being an OEM product, fits perfectly and works very well."
Price is right. Works well in our Samsung refrigerator.
"Easy install with a small amount of water leakage (as the instructions warned).  It would be nice if Samsung offered a 'volume discount' on these filters, but they don't.  Because this is a proprietary part, they have you over a barrel, which is always annoying."
Easy install works great thus far.
I like OEM products.  That protects the warranty and it’s reassuring I did what I could to maintain a large investment.  The shipping was great and on time.
"I know this is a OEM replacement filter, but my water does run noticeably slower since I change the original filter.  Meets all other expectations."
"Cost is a bit much, but it is worth the money for not coming home to a minor flood"
"una vez lo he abierto despues de usarlo por 6 meses , muy bien hecio , nada que ver con una imitacion cina"
After buying the big box store brand I noticed the water flowing very slowly. After measuring it and it was 3 oz per minute. I bought this genuine Samsung filter and the flow is almost triple. Big time savings when filling water glasses for 8!
Easy install.  No leaks. I forgot to turn the water off before installing. Luckily no issues. I emptied 3 gallons before drinking from it.
Was exactly the right one!
"Pay attention if this has the same system number for your fridge. I bought  filters form my fridge many times on amazon and always came the same one. Then,  kept re-directing me to this one when I select buy again (the same filter I have bought before).I did notice that the system number was bit different but thought was a new model.  I received something different,  model number is the same but system is not. And it did not work with my samsung french door. It's not the same filter I bought a few times. Make sure all the numbers are the same as you have in your fridge before you buy it. It was leaking and didn't work with mine. I did give a try. Then, I had to buy another one from samsung website and everything is working normal again."
Original product. A little less costly than other places. Will buy again if price doesn’t go up.
"I’m satisfied with this product, very good quality and I’ll buy it again."
"Does what it's suppose to do - just wish they weren't so expensive.  Have tried other brands and it's been hit or miss... some work, some leak.  So it's just not worth it and that's why I now choose to spend the extra for the Samsung.  Just look around for a good price and stock up."
Exact replacement cartridge for the originally installed factory cartridge; worked perfect!
"Fits perfect in my Samsung refrig.  Even though pricing is a little high, better than getting from stores especially if ordering 2 pack.  Have ordered before and would continue to order in future."
Quality item.  Timely shipping.
I think you get what you pay for and I have tried other brands ... this one is better.
"Great product,  EZ to install"
Great filter and easily to install.
Great value and easy to install
"Not sure you can ""love"" water filters, but they work as described. Easy to change. Fits well. Just wishing there was a recycling program for these."
I akways use this Samsung product
Went right in (as would be expected).Make sure you have a towel ready and the water supply shut off before you replace the old one!
"Fits fine. However, took me a while to figure out that you have to reset via door button to turn off the change filter warning light. Takes a little while to run a few gallons through the new filter."
Spendy but better than the off brands
"This is an OEM replacement for my Samsung refrigerator.  The big box store sell this EXACT item for $44.88 each. I got them for $27.50 each, of course I bought a few as they only last 6 months.  The price just went up but I will suspect if you watch them the price will drop again.  Fast shipping with prime!"
"Great price!  If you go to samsung, or a big box store to buy this item, it will be 20 to 30% more expensive.  Very easy to install.  The instruction guide indicates you have to replace every 3 months i believe but it really depends on how much water you use.  Very satisfied with price and quality."
Easy to install. Seems to be filtering as expected.
I didn't want to pay $32 per filter retail price for these nor did I want the generic kind after reading reviews so I started some internet shopping. Glad I found these here on Amazon. They are Samsung brand & they fit like they should. The act of replacing the filter was a bit of a chore but all is well.
"Prices on Amazon are the BEST, I found these Samsung Genuine DA29-00020B Refrigerator Water Filters, they work great, so I will continue to buy them.
Samsung Genuine DA29-00020B Refrigerator Water Filter, 1 Pack"
A tad pricey but worked better than a lower price replacement which leaked
This filter was an exact match to the original and installed very easily.  As other reviews have posted I did not turn off my water supply and had no problems.  My water supply valve leaks sometimes when it is turned off/on so it was nice not to have to do it. Would most definitely buy this filter from Amazon again.
"i like it, but feel as though its a rip off.  I will probably install an in line filter to eliminate the costly replacement of this one."
Not worth the money.  Look at non brand name that work the same.
It worked as expected
"These are NOT cheap and buying three at once was the lowest I could find online. The model number on my original ended with an ""A"" these have a ""B"" and fit perfect. Samsung seems to not make the same model they put in the frig when you buy it new."
Filter fits perfect. Instructions recommend running a certain amount of water through the filter before using. I did the recommended amount but it still seemed to take some time before the water tasted good.
"These work, they just piss me off how much they are and how short they last.  Maybe that is just me being naive and switching it out right when the filter light turns red, but man this stings in the wallet.  -1 star for longevity."
Expensive but works well
Nsf42 and Nsf53 rated unlike other filters.  Four stars because they are expensive but I trust these more than aftermarket.
Excellent better price than Best Buy
I have it for two days and it’s working good so far
Perfect fit. Good instructions to install.
"Filter connection head is different than the ones that I have received in the past. Has the same part number and looks identical but the diameter of the connection hole is smaller and doesn't connect properly resulting in water leaking out. This can go unnoticed since it leaks slowly so be careful that this will work in your fridge. I unfortunately didn't notice this small difference until I had water all over my kitchen floor and pouring into my basement. Even with the wrong connection size hole it still slid in and locked in place leaving me to believe everything was good to go. I have seen 5 star reviews on this filter, and I have seen a few reviews that had a similar experience to mine, so I am not sure what is creating the difference. I would be curious to see what the year and model #'s are on the reviews that had similar issues. Mine is the 2012 RF4287HARS French Door Samsung Fridge."
This filter is hard for me to find locally and when i do find it local it is more expensive. Have purchased several and it works great for us.
worked well with our refrigerator
Love how easy it is to install.
"Brand name items sometimes are better than generic items.  It seems this filter lasts longer than the cheaper filters. I hate spending more money, but sometimes it is worthwhile.  The price on this particular filter was a  better price than other sellers."
"We tried the generic version of these from home depot; don't do it. This is more expensive, but worth it. The water tastes better and the generic versions made our Samsung fridge make noises."
Flavor?  It was easy to install but I though pricy
"Good quality, fit my refrigerator well, consistent performance, last about six months for the last 3 or 4 theaters"
Quick delivery... Easy to install flavorless order free water.
"I had been using the generic model for months but noticed the fridge wasn't making ice as quickly as it should.  Before calling service, I decided to try the manufacturer's filter.  I'm so glad I did.  We now have ice all the time and don't run out."
Fit and worked great.
It works as advertised.
Exactly as expected
This is the suggested water filter for our fridge and we never used another brand.It works really well. I notice the difference between tap's water and filter's water at the cats' fountain: filter's water is long-lasting clear and clean.
FIts. No leaks. Easy to install. Only time will tell how many stars it honestly merits.
"This is the right filter for our fridge and was 1/4 cheaper through Amazon, so that's a great deal to me!  I was a little reluctant to use an ""aftermarket"" brand, as some of the reviewers said the water didn't flow as well, so that's why I stuck w/Samsung.  Works great and the water taste is good - a.k.a. no taste!"
Excellent replacement water filter.
Great replacement water filter. Easy to install.
Just by the OEM you'll be disappointed if you're not we tried other generic brands and I can tell you after day or two with the generic brands the water has an order and just doesn't taste as good as this
Filters well/no added taste
"Genuine replacement. Delivery fast before the fridge made audible warning noises. Three-pack is good, too."
product for my family hub fridge.  easy to install.  I do recommend the water to be shut off before replacing as instructions state.
I don't know how one can really rate a filter without performing any data analysis.Since I didn't test my tap water against water produced by this filter I can't rate that aspect but the ease of installation and the price is significant enough to warrant it 5 stars. What would be even more cost effective would be the three pack.
Fit perfectly.  Exactly as advertised.
This filter is easy to install and certainly seems to work well in filtration (water tastes 'cleaner').  Only issue I have is that you need to run a ton of water through it initially once you install it per the directions.  Otherwise your water supply will not flow smoothly.
Easy to install.
"After reading some of the reviews, I hesitated buying this our first replacement.  I do not know if competitors post bogus stuff or what?  It is identical to the original filter (no smaller hole, no leaks).  It works perfect.  Great Amazon service."
This is the real deal.  A genuine Samsung OEM product.  Works perfectly and flawlessly in my Samsung refrigerator.  You can't go wrong with this filter.  Highly recommended!
Bien
This filter does the job.
"Awesome filter, original product"
👌  ok
"Easy to install, thought it was a bit expensive for a water filter though."
Always the best option and quality
It’s good and fits perfectly
"Test it before and after the new filter installed with a tester,  296 and now 287, same result as tap water"
Was as described.  Fit perfectly
Came in quickly and worked as described.
There is a definite difference in the taste.  He used to tell he couldn't tell but the other day he got a glass of water from the tap because I was in the refrigerator getting out things for supper & he turned around poured it out after one swallow.
Great product a bit pricey though. Fits perfect and no issues with leaking like off brand options.
It serves its purpose
Seems to do what it is supposed to do
very good product.  i highly recommend
These water filters are easy to install. Takes less than a minute. They are an exact fit for my fridge
"Do not buy the off-brand ones!  The holes are too small and can cause the waterline inside the freezer to back up and freeze, thus disabling the Icemaker.  Ask me; I know as I had to have my fridge repaired due to using the cheaper filters.  Only use OEM!"
"My frig is now about 6 months old and the water filter light turned red.  Amazon is my first place to shop for everything and I bought a 2-pack of these Samsung water filters.  Based on the description, they were the model I needed.  Sure enough, the new one is just like the one that came with the frig."
"Fit good, no leaks that I know of, water tastes great. No reduction in water pressure either. Seems to be the legit filter from Samsung."
Great since they don’t sell them at sears anymore.
"I considered going with cheap replacement parts, but given that the original filter lasted two years without negatively affecting the taste of the water, I wanted to stick with what was the proven best. I'm happy with my purchase."
"I tried using the ""generic"" version of these filter cartridges to save some money, but they made the water taste like plastic.  I will be using the real deal from now on."
"Seems to work well.  There is a bit of that new filter taste even after draining a few gallons, but I see no other issues."
I can't say anything here really... it is the filter for my samsung fridge and it fits perfectly like it should. Check and make sure you are getting the cheapest one in this group commonly the one pack is cheaper to get 2 of than the 2 pack. I bought a couple of 1 packs because it saved several dollars.
Easy to install. Water taste better.
A++
"We installed this per instructions (shut off water then flush for 6 minutes to remove air to prevent leaking) and it leaked a constant drip which overnight filled the large drawer under the filter plus ran down the outside of our fridge. We also noticed a chlorine flavor in the water. Called Samsung to ask about this problem and was told to check the filter for a serial number because a Samsung filter will have it. Our old filter had one but guess what...the new one did not!  We purchased one at Lowes after checking for the serial number which was there, and sent back the fake one.  We had NO leaking problem with filter from Lowe's. I did notice (after the fact) that another customer posted a pic on the review which shows a real vs fake filter and you can clearly see that the serial number is missing from the fake one."
Great price!  Thank you!
"These are Samsung filters. One difference I noticed is that the original factory filter I replaced had 2 O-rings, the Samsung OEM replacement filter I received has 1 O-ring. I don't know what difference that makes. Will modify this later if there appears to be a problem."
"Like so many others, replacing a water filter means your water dispenser will no longer work.  I bought two of these so that I would have a spare.  When I put the first one in, I started getting the famous jackhammer sound from back of refrigerator.  No kinks.  Water line open.  So I tried the second one.  Same thing.  Didn't matter how much water I put through, the jackhammer noise wouldn't stop.  I removed the water filter as a last resort.  Now it makes the jackhammer noise even without a filter in it.  Wish I never would have changed the filter.  This problem is common.  My daughter's friend went to use the water dispenser and said ""oh yeah, that happened to us too."""
Dont buy the cheap buy this one if you have Samsung  trust me
Great price easy to install
Great filter! Easy to install.
"if you buy this product from amazon you will save $$, forget about lowes,bb,  easy to install hassle to turn off water and move fridge, last 4-6 mos for my family, I knew what if was get into when I bought this fridge, overall I am very pleased"
Works like it’s supposed to.
Will but again
"perfect fit, saves a trip to sears store, price is same online or at store."
Goes right in without requiring you to shut off the water.  You'll spend longer priming the filter than you will removing and replacing it.  The whole process takes just a couple minutes.
Works fine and easy to install and like clock work light comes on the refrigerator every six months to replace.!
"Perfect fit, easy to install"
Fits like a glove! Just remember to turn off valve before you change it. We read the instructions and felt the need to share this with you.
"Item was delivered quickly and replaced quickly for free.  However, this was a replacement filter for one I had ordered earlier.  Both filters caused air to get into lines and makes the most horrible noise.  It has damaged my new Samsung refridgerator.  I really do not think it's the seller's fault.  I think it's the product.  I'm not sure if these filters are refurbished.  I bought them as new."
This is the last OEM I will buy.  These are way over priced.  They are probably good quality filters but I have no interest in keeping Samsung profits up and getting price gouged. Next time I will look for the cheaper and best rated replacement filters.
Exact match for fridge and working well. Not sure if it’s my fridge or the filter but tends to back up with water pressure and not perform.
"I had some issues getting the filter to seat correctly without leaking.  Took a couple tries, but it appears to be working now.  I found that just letting the filter guide itself in without applying much pressure was the best method.  When it leaked I was applying inward pressure while twisting.  I'll update this review if status changes."
"Performed well, but priced very high."
Since these are Samsung filters for my specific refrigerator I would expect that they would fit and do the job as they did.  Buying it in a 3 pack from Amazon vs. paying for them at the local Lowes was much cheaper especially when considering as a prime member they were in front of my home in two days.  Wonderful!
purchasing in volume saves money
Fast delivery. Leaked at first but after a short time sealed itself. Works great.
"Product as described, arrived quickly, and put to use immediately with no difficulty.  Fit exactly as intended"
"Dirty water goes in and clean water comes out, how does it happen? Nobody knows. It's a OEM replacement for pretty much most of the Samsung fridges. Comes with instructions and just have to dump out few gallons of water to be able to use. Pretty standard and this is a boring review. Just buy this if you need it."
"My change filter light goes on, I go to the web, review my previous order of the appropriate filter for my Samsung, and reorder. The filter arrived within 48 hours. Installed the new filter -- done!  And much less expensive than Home Depot or Lowe's."
Perfect fit for my Samsung refrigerator. I decided to go for the genuine product and not risk any leak - it worked out fine.
My first filter out of my brand new refrigerator had very clear wording that read DA-29-00020A.  After a bunch of research I couldn't track it down...Even Samsung told me it didn't exist in the part number world.  I read a few reviews and found out other people were having the same issue.  DA-29-00020B is the replacement for DA-29-00020A.
Nice but pricey. Works as advertised.
"I always buy this product and works very good, but it is expensibe"
It is a great product makes our water taste so much better
This was the most amazing Samsung refrigerator water filter I have ever purchased. I installed it and it took two minutes. It was much easier than I anticipated.
Great product!
"Perfect fit, great product"
"Wish these were more reasonably priced. Samsung says you have to use their brand, and the refrigerator was so expensive, I don't want to risk it. Very easy to change this filter."
Perfect replacement
Would have given 5 stars but I couldn't find the stickers that allows you to put the month that you replaced to help keep track of the next replacement date.
Very easy to install. Quick delivery. Good product for my Samsung fridge
"It fits well to my Samsung fridge. Hope it does a good job. I have no idea what base I can use to evaluate its quality. Delivery was excellent, getting it in just two days. Price was very good. $ 99 for 3 instead of $49 each. Very pleased withmy order."
Would be a 5 STAR but felt it was a bit pricey.
Samsung water filter is made by Samsung for the refrigerator.  Never had an issue with the actual Samsung made filters but I have had problems with leaking with generic OEM filters
Used this product in my Samsung refrigerator. I find using the original OEM is better than the generic brands. No leaks.
Works great!!  Had purchased a replacement from Walmart (Great Value brand) and it leaked like a sieve no matter how many times I tried to reseat it.  Bought this one and haven't had a single drop.  Moral of the story...DON'T BUY A WALMART FRIDGE FILTER!!! 😉
"I have ordered this3 times since I have had my refrigerator. Important note...before installing it, take the white cap off or it will not go in!"
"Easy to install, good flavor of clean water"
"This is the direct replacement for my Samsung refrigerator. I live off of well water and this filter lasts me 6 months. I can only imagine how long it would survive if I had ""city"" water. This is the second one I have purchased through this vendor and am completely satisfied with product and vendor. Many thanks for a Good deal."
I thought I would try this online since it was a lot cheaper.  The model was the same so I figured why not.. No I was completely wrong.. after installing this product I notice that the arrow to be aligned up was slightly off. I also thought I installed it wrong or the pressure was causing it so I turned off the water line valve to stop the pressure and reinstalled. Still the arrow to align was slightly off. But I still kept it on.. I started to notice drips of water below in the tray and the water was tasting funny. It was pretty bad that my water from the faucet tasted better.  I also did run a gallon of water out to clean it..I then went out to home depot and bought one for 40 bucks and installed it.. The first thing I noticed was that the arrows aligned right up.. I then ran about a gallon of water out to filter it and the water taste was much improved. Don't try to skimp on a few dollars on this filter and buy one at the store.
I bought an off-brand and got charcoal gray ice for it. I immediately bought the official Samsung filter and it's working very well. The price is 4 times as much but it's worth it.
Easy to install and works well
Good price and easy install!
"Perfect fit, no leaks"
"The water filter does exactly what it's designed to do; Cost me more money.  The problem (not for Samsung) is that the stupid filter has to be changed every 6 months or whenever it gets full of impurities.  Duh!  More money for Samsung so I can keep paying and paying and paying.  The filter should work at a superior level and be cleanable/washable so I can save money, not spend more for the same product."
Better then ordering it from hub cost more.
"haven't used yet, wanted to make sure we could get a new one. this is an original one and fit perfect"
"Easy to install, arrived on time and was exactly as described"
These are OEM products and work perfectfully.  Getting the 3 pack is a real money saver; they must be replaced every 4 to 6 months so they aren't wasted.
Was as the seller described but there were white cloud particles in the water after it was installed. And had to let the water run for at lease 10mins before it cleared up.
Filters i suppose.... not sure what else to say. Though i could just install an inline 5 year filter and be done. just my 2 c
Classy use and easy to quickly level up the filter
No leaks. Get about 6 months out of these. Not a fan of the price but am unwilling to try knockoffs and potentially deal with leaks.
This filter fits my Samsung fridge perfectly.  I have not experienced any leaks or drips as some other reviewers stated.  Filter is good for approx 6 months.
"El producto es totalmente nuevo, original y el envío rápido y gratis"
"Dinged for the price...there are plenty of generics that work just as well...I've tried them. This one is OEM, yes, I get it, but there's no need to cost so much..."
"The filter is excellent-a Samsung product that ships and arrives on time, in good condition and is as advertised. it is easy to buy, takes very few days to arrive and no fuss about finding it locally. I highly recommend the seller and will buy again. I bought two of these as they were cheaper than the double pack."
"Tried generic filters and though they had great ratings, they never worked.  Getting the Samsung filter was like night and day.  Will order again."
"Removes the chlorine taste, easy to install and expensive; like all O.E.M. filters.Being expensive is painful but it doesn't make me lose sleep.  What would make me lose sleep is if I bought an aftermarket filter, the housing cracked, and water ruined my hardwood floor."
"This is a lifesaver in terms of convenience when it's time for me to change my fridge's water filter. When I see the little red light on my fridge telling me to replace it, I order this, and 2 days later I have a new filter installed within a minute. Literally no complaints here."
Never goes wrong with OEM filter. I tried aftermarket before but went back with original filter.
will be buying again
This was sold by Steve's Filters and I must say they were right on top of my order.  I was emailed and assured right away that if for any reason at all the filter that I ordered didn't fill my needs that they would do what ever possible to satisfy my requirements.Hats off to you Steve!
"If it isn't the official one, it is darn close.  Water tastes good, fits perfectly.  Seems cheaper now to just buy them one at a time rather than a multipack."
"As soon as I installed this, I could tell something wasn't right.  I've installed 3 previous replacements, and they were all simple and worked great. This one, the arrows on the filter did not align vertically/properly to the lock symbol like the previous filters did, and I tightened it as far as it could go.  I even took it out and repeated the process a couple times.  As SOON as I dispensed water for the 1st time, the frig started making loud grinding noises from the back.  First the noises were pulsating.  Then a couple days later, the grinding was just ongoing and getting louder while dispensing.  There was also water leaking into the big tray inside.  I went and bought another new filter, this time at the local appliance store, and after install, the frig immediately stopped making the noises and all is fine now.UPDATE: I forgot to mention that there were multiple words on the ""Samsung"" Filter box that were spelled incorrectly.  I suspect knock off."
"Had purchased Home Depot replacements...bad mistake as the kitchen was flooded.  Repair man said that despite being ""replacements"", the grooves are off a bit.  Will only use the OEM replacement  from now on"
"Work the best, better cost per each purchaseing them this way. Excellent value amazing quality!"
Samsung quality says it all!
Great filter.
"After changing, it may cause the refrig water spigot to slowly drip until it is run enough to remove all the trapped air."
"When this filter is installed the integrated ""handle"" on the end of the filter no longer points straight up and down.  That would make you think that it is not locked in place.  I removed it and put it next to the original filter and this appears to be a quality control issue.  In relation to the end of the filter with the o rings, the integrated handle on the new filter is about 15 degrees off."
My water still tastes like water.  But it's OEM and I paid twice as much.  So it must be 5 stars?
"Does it's job and is better than the one knock-off I tried.  Unfortunately, you pay a lot of extra money for the name."
"Fits perfectly and works as it should.  Swapping is easy although this was the first replacement so the original filter was reluctant to come out.  No leaks, ez flush."
Original filter for less money 😊
"I read the reviews about this filter causing abnormal and excessive noise after being installed. I agree, initially there was some noise when the system had to pressurize again. Now, after several gallons of water have passed through the filter, this thing is great. Water is particle free and tastes great. No issues, will purchase product again."
"Instructions for frig did not tell you which model filter to Jude. Also, instructions were contradictory regarding whether or not to shut off water supply before installing. Since it would take a small bulldozer to pill out thr frig in order to access the water shutoff, I took the chance a nd changed it w/o turning off the water. NO PROBLEMS!"
My Samsung fridge kept sometimed making a loud growling noise when water was dispensed. Turns out it was because I was using a cheap off-brand filter. Put this one in and a month or so later  it hasn't done it again.
I purchased this filter from Amazon because I was told they were less expensive than other places which I did find to be true.  It works just as well and ones I have bought from the big box stores and it was delivered right to my house.  I didn't have to run around town looking for one.
"easy to install, hope it's working."
Great product
Exact same product & model number as in the store but paid 1/2 the price than my local hardware and it works like a charm.  Timed out roughly around 6 months after purchase (the norm for a water filter) and I purchased another one and no problems thus far.
Water is clear and tastes great. Don't go cheap and by the knock off brand. Pay the few extra bucks for a reliable water filter.
"Filter came fast and looks in perfect condition, however, the o-rings and seal are not fitting correcting causing major leakage. Super disappointed and frustrating bc all the water is an absolute mess!When the filter works the flavor is great.Am going to try to return or actually replace first."
It is more expensive than other units but it works exactly as it should.  Recommended.
Works 3
"This is simple - it works and works correctly - EASY installation.I was on the fence about buying the name brand vs. generic - went with name brand, yea it's a few bucks more -but hey in my case the filter lasted over 2 years - I wasnt sure a generic filter would last that long"
Authentic Samsung filter. Water tastes great and we have had not issues. Very easy to install new filter
"I bought this original filter to my refrigerator and I am so glad that filter was made in Mexico as the original from the factory, better quality than the ones made overseas."
works perfectly in my samsung frigeach one lasts 3 months
Item was shipped quickly and works as it is intended to work with my Samsung refrigerator.
Super happy with it
Just buy the real thing for your Samsung fridge. The substitutes are just not as good. Tried one of them but came back to these. Less expensive in the two pack.
So essy to install
works great but the price makes you feel screwed
1000% better than offbrand
"No complaints, it's a perfect fit. Hard to praise the accolades of a OEM replacement part. :)"
"The was the first replacement filter we've needed for a new refridgerator. I went with the brand name first, just to make sure all went well. It is more expensive than the many generic filters, but I cannot yet compare. This went in easily, and the seal works well."
"We love our Samsung frig and the built in filtered water system.  With that said the refils can be pretty pricey.  My husband was spending more on a 2 pack than this 3 pack price!  When the light came on that it was time to change, I ordered that day and received just a few days later."
Easy to install but expensive...
"This water filter works but it has a ""B"" at the end instead of an ""A"" like my original one had.  For some reason the water comes out of the fridge slower after we put this filter in verses the way it did for the original filter.  Other than that it works great!"
Great value water is fine.
"After purchasing a Samsung refrigerator,  the instructions explain a filter should be changed every 6 months, the panel on the door also reminds me.  I searched the island of Oahu for a replacement filter and Amazon had the best price and offered a pack of three.  I would recommend purchasing your filters [if you have a Samsung refrigerator] from Amazon.com."
Works well. Can taste the difference in the water.
"The filter I received was an exact replacement to the filter I originally received with my Samsung Refridferator. As you can see from the pic, I had no issue with a change in hole size or change in the nozzle size. It fit perfectly."
Installation and operation were as  expected. Little pricy however.
Don't waste time and money with cheaper clones. This one fits and works as required.
"Easy to install, works great,"
"A little pricey, but a must have for your Samsung fridge."
water filter prices are getting extremely expensive in stores and having a water filter that fit my refrigerator was a relief. I recommend the seller because I had no problems and the price for water filter was reasonable. If the product number does not match do not attempt to fit another part number that does not match.Fast shipping.
"After trying after market, I found that only OEM filters worked. But even these sometimes leaked. I noticed with this filter they modified it to have two o-rings! No leaks!! Good job Samsung."
Arrived quickly. Worked as it should.
Easy to install. There’s cheaper brands out there but I’d just spend the money and get this
Installed quickly and easily in my Samsung refrigerator without having to turn the water off. The additional O ring on the water entrance end is a plus.
Works great in my Samsung refrigerator with ice and water filtration in the door. I had some leaks using cheaper imitations.
Very straight forward installation
Perfect replacement filter for a very good price.
We use it for our our refrigerator.  So far it’s working fine.
"Turned off the water (main needed to be used). Too much work to move the frig.. Swapped out the filter, and I was back in operation in 5 min."
"I was happy to find this item online at amazon.  I purchased my new Samsung fridge last September that has a water filter for making ice, but not a drinking spout.  We have a family of 5 and we average about 4-5 months use out of this product for the sole purpose of making ice.  Good price!"
"I have not installed this in my refrigerator yet.  I bought one from a local store and it cost me more, so I took it back and bought this one which was identical to my other one.  Will definitely purchase it from here instead of the store, unless they decide to up their price on Amazon."
"Unfortunately the product is not as advertised, it’s not a real Samsung filter which I was disappointed to see so it didn’t even fit into my fridge."
It's my replacement for my refrigerator.  It's great product . J only have to change it every 6 to 9 months.
I just replaced my filter to notice this last one I received did not have the authentication tab to check if it is authentic. Very disappointing and will cancel subscription unfortunately.
Filter worked perfectly. I originally bought an off brand and it failed miserably. The seal was thin and water leaked all over my kitchen. Bought this actual Samsung one for my Samsung fridge and it is perfect. Never again going to trust an off name for this.
Purchased Samsung brand as I do not trust no name brands
Works great
"Okay, let's face it, it's a filter! It filters the water to the ice maker and in-door water access. Putting the new one in, is something you need to do every 6 months or so. Be sure to check your owners manual, or go on Samsung's website to ensure you order the correct filter for your fridge."
"I don't know why, but these filters don't last as long as they should in my Samsung fridge. I've bought several, all with the same result. There are only 2 people living in the house, and the filter begins to run slow after just 6-8 weeks. Combine that with the price, and I give it only 3 stars."
product works as expected
Liked easy installation!!
"We like it, it seems to work just fine. I'm no expert on refrigerator water filters, but I like the way the water tastes when I drink it and the filter lasts us about a year."
"great filter, samsung filter for samsung fridge,  not complaints."
The item is exactly what we needed and was relatively easy to install.
No issues.
Lasted several months (6-8) and we have 5 people in our household using the frig water system daily. We have hard water where we live with high level of chlorine. Tap water is not very tasty but refrigerator water is very good
"Good water filter.  I do wish if filtered fluoride -- for the price, I would expect that."
"will work for approx two weeks then plugs up,  upon taking it out and reinstall it, it will work for another two weeks then plug up again, etc,etc until its time to install a new one will not buy this brand again"
Glad to have it delivered
"It fits my refrigerator.  It's much more expensive, and I don't know why.  I'm sure the off brand fits just the same, but I'm not sure what the difference in the filter quality is.  I wish the description of the product would address the cost."
Good price
"I have a Samsung French door fridge. Previously I had tried a different brand of filter to save money, but it didn't work well. Water pressure was lower (by half), often the fridge would make a loud noise when I got water from it. On the other hand, this filter works great."
Good product but highly priced
It does the job and was much cheaper than the dealer.
Easy to change. Taste good!!
does the job
This is NOT an authentic Samsung water filter. It does not have the authentication tag on the filter. The cover of the filter box cannot even close. It’s a fake.
Great product. Easy to install and my water is back to tasting great.
"Not sure how its supposed to filter the water in our Samsung fridge; the H20 still has a bit off an ""off"" taste to it. Not so bad when I add flavoring(s) to my water. Straight from the fridge it makes me pucker up and wonder what exactly is that taste. I prefer our bottled water dispenser water for drinking."
"I purchased this filter in Aug 2014 and it was working fine, but about a month ago (Jan 2015) I noticed the water flow from the dispenser was very slow. I removed the filter and wow what a difference! So either the filter was defective, or these things just don't last very long. I am going to purchase from somewhere else."
Great product & priced
decent deal
Easy peasy to install.
"I bought this filter in Sept 26, 2013  fit great, works great.  I wanted to order another from this same vendor now 2/26/2014 and the price has gone up $10 !  that is crazy...its the same darn filter.  Disappointed in this vendor raising the price this much in only a few short months."
"I've had this filter on Subscribe and Save for about 2 years now and never had an issue but recently they stopped sending the Da29-00020b-1P and started sending Da29-00020b-E instead. You can put insert the filter in but it is not compatible like others are saying. The head is different and it doesn't flow right. My fridge started making a really loud noise and sometimes the water wouldn't even flow through. I ordered another one and again got the E instead of the 1P.  We tried it again the water would flow but still a loud noise. Had a Appliance Repairman come out thinking maybe the filter housing was going out, but he also confirmed it's the wrong filter."
Easy to install
"7/7/18 update: I must've flaked, because I bought another 'Samsung' filter from this vendor after reading some positive reviews. We immediately noticed that the water coming out tastes like it came from an old plastic cup, especially after it had been sitting for a while. Disgusting, and a waste of money. That filter is going in the trash.*********************FAKE. What is pictured is the Korean version, which is manufactured by Samsung, doesn't leak, and filters Lead/Mercury. What was sent was made in Mexico, is licensed but not authorized by Samsung, often leaks, and does NOT filter for Lead/Mercury.  Big, big difference.  Don't be fooled by apparent labels....do your research.  After sending this one back, I ordered directly from Samsung and go what is pictured. No great Prime shipping, but also no leaks, and no lead or mercury."
"My light came on and we went into a scramble. We love our Samsung and hoped it would be an easy task to replace our filter. Fit perfectly and easy installation. Good price, as I am a PRIME member, based on what I saw on line from manufacturer and shipping cost"
Good product
Alittle difficult to install but works well
"Wasn't sure what I needed but the description fitted what I thought I needed. Faster then a speeding bullet, I received my new Samsung filter. It installed with no problem. The price and the delivery service, from the seller were great, as advertised!! If I need a similar item, I will certainly use them.Joe B"
"Original replacement filter, works great. I do get air in the system frequently not sure why, but water tastes great, filter does exactly what it's supposed to."
Auto order seems to come as soon as the red light turns on our fridge. Pretty pleased with price and quality for our Samsung side by side
Delivered on time. Easy to install. No issues. Thank you!
"Ok so I originally went cheap and bought generic filters for our refrigerator.  Big mistake.  The water came out so fast, it would spill on the floor.  When I replaced them again I went with the model actually made for our fridge.  So much better."
What kind of review can you write about a refrigerator filter?  I am not sure I could tell a really great refrigerator filter from a mediocre one.  It fits my refrigerator.  Water comes out of the door.  All is good.
"Perfect fit. No leaking whatsoever. Improved water pressure out of water dispenser in fridge and increased ice output. Last filter change was in September which I feel for the price the filter should last at least 6 months, after a few months we notice that the water is slower coming out of the dispenser and makes next to no ice. Overall product is meeting my expectations. *** Update 2-22- after 2 months water is coming out slower and making less and less ice by the day. Very disappointed that at this price for a Samsung replacement filter that it has only lasted 2 months. I feel ripped off. This filter should last at least 6 months..."
"Produces clear, clean, great tasting water and lasts a full 6 months.  A little expensive, but worth it when compared with the cost of bottled water and the hassle.  Great product.  I love Samsung products!"
No problems with anything. I shut water off to fridge when replacing.
Does it's job very well
Expensive
These are not authentic Samsung filters. They leave a nasty white film in our drinking glasses. Plus it jammed up the ice maker. Do not buy this garbage at any price.
I have one of those fancy 4 door Samsung cabinet depth refrigerators.  This was the filter I swapped when the stupid thing told me to do so.  Not convinced we used 300 gallons of water in the original one but whatever.  I'm a consumer and I consumed.  Will consume again once the machine tells me to do so.  Cheaper than HD.
Perfect fit quick delivery
"Thank goodness I was able to buy this filter online!! I recently found out that the Appliance store where I purchased the refrigerator two years ago, along with these replacement filters up until last summer has suddenly closed up shop!!"
The right filter. Works great and water taste good. 3rd party I tried diidn't work at all. What was cheap was expensive.
"Installed this water filter on my refrigerator, made sure that it was an ""original"" manufactured product amazon and once i received it i followed directions and installed it as instructed. I woke up in the middle of the night to grab a cup of water and my whole entire kitchen was flooded with water.... later i found out that this water filter caused the water pump of my refrigerator to explode and now i have to purchase a new fridge!! NOT WORTH A SINGLE PENNY this product is an aftermarket product and the labeling is not authentic- i made a comparison to the original that came with the fridge and it was not the same. Now i have to buy a new fridge $5,000 cost"
We purchased an after market filter before and it dripped water into the crisper drawer. Not again
"This filter is a bit costly, but it does a great job of keeping the water fresh."
Pricey but water doesn’t taste the same with third party filters
"Works as advertised. Pull the old one out, plug the new one in. Seemed to take a bit long to get a good flush through it. But what do I know, tastes like water."
I decided to order the factory water filter for my Samsung refrigerator after reading multiple posts about problems with less costly replacements.  The new filter installed easily (1 minute) after filling it per the instructions.  Great product. More expensive then some alternatives by a few bucks but I think it was well worth the cost.
"The same filters selling for a lot more if you buy direct from Samsung. Worked like a charm! We had no issues whatsoever changing the filters out, and it made all the difference in the world as far as water quality. No more slow-dripping water, and it tastes great!"
"I dont think any other filter fits in my samsung fridge so I buy this one over and over.  I don't use the water from my fridge, however the ice is very clear and tastes fresh with my other filtered water.  Easy to insert and remove."
Works great and seems to last forever.  I last changed mine a year ago.  Price has dropped too.  Seems to make good ice!
BEWARE!  RIPOFF!  I installed the filter in Feb 2016 and the water did not flow well at all.  No better than the one I replaced.  I thought maybe the water pressure must be low.  Then I had enough and went to a well known large hardware store and purchased the same filter but it was packed in plastic which in no way allowed tampering.  The one I received from Amazon was in a filter box. To my pleasant surprise the filter from the large hardware store worked great.  I now suspect the filter I received from Amazon was a used filter that someone replaced and sold it to me.  BEWARE!  It did not work.  Save your money -- it's cheaper because it's used up.....  Just to be fair - I have bought other Samsung filters in the past from Amazon and did not have any problems.
Perfect for my Samsung refrigerator.  Easy to order online especially since Sears doesn't carry these anymore.  Will re-order when needed.
I ordered a pack of three filters. The first one I tried was defective. The second filter worked. I have no idea if the third filter works and will not know until six months when I'm ready to replace the old filter. Since I can't return all three filters because I'm using one in my frig I can't be reimbursed for the defective filter.  I wouldn't have given any stars but had to give a least one.
With  Samsung Fridge one must order the water filters from a Samsung supplier or the filter will leak
If you have a refrigerator with a ice maker and a water system then you blow through these filters about once every 6 months.  I wised up and bought the two-pack so I wouldn't be caught empty-handed the next time I needed one.  Now I just have to remember to reorder when I use the second one...
Always use the official parts.  They work the best!
These fit my fridge pretty well. We did have some trouble with leakage for the first hour after installing them though. Didn't seem to want to fit until it finally settled in and fully filled.
"Great product, fast shipping."
But I would never recommend a Samsung refrigerator in the first place.  My fridge is a few years old and local power surges destroyed the main computer board and it just cost me half the price of the fridge to fix it!  I was horrified!  Will never buy another Samsung fridge.  Beware!
"Preferred brand, part for my fridge"
It fits my fridge and filters my water nicely
"As advertised, easily installed!"
Is as expected at a reasonable price.
Great purchase fits and installs instantly
THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL AT AMAZON AND I'M VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE.  IT WAS SIMPLE TO INSTALL AND SEEMS TO WORKING PROPERLY.  WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE MY NEXT FILTER AT AMAZON.  RECEIVED THE PRODUCT PROMPTLY AND IN GOOD CONDITION AND DIDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE MY HOUSE WHO COULD ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE
Very good quality and couldn't be easier to replace
Easy to plug into the fridge and run some water and now tastes great
The problem I have may be with our plumbing. I only get about 3 months use before I have to replace. I believe it's the sediment build up from my pipes though.
I did not know I had to replace the filter on my refrigerator. Looked for it on the Samsung website and compared prices. It was cheaper through Amazon. It took me a while to decipher which filter I needed for the refrigerator but picked the correct one. It was fairly easy to install.
I prefer paying up for oem as they have fit every time.
I honestly cannot say enough good things about Samsung's refrigerators and the installation and flawless design of the filter merely solidified my position.  Installation is simple.  You just slide it in and turn it.  I think Samsung is the best company out there right now in terms of design.  And the water tastes great.
comparatively reasonable price (as opposed to Best Buy or Lowes) and good delivery time -- easy to install and works well
I will NEVER buy another Samsung frig or any other product.  Our frig leaks constantly!!
"As described by seller, love it."
Just what I needed.
"Perfect Samsung filter. This is a Samsung filter, not a knock off. Does a great job of making our water taste better."
The product fully met my expectations. It was easy to install. I did not cut water flow to the fridge before installing and had zero issues.The previous filter lasted my household of 3 about 8 months.
It work just like the first one that the refrigerator  brings
Great buy
"I purchased 3 of these Water Filters and they were an excellent bargain @ $29.99 each, as opposed to the usual price from Samsung of $49.99 each. I need to use the Samsung brand, as my Refrigerator is still under warranty and an off brand would negate my warranty. I highly recommend these filters."
"Easy to use and replace.  We usually get the mineral water filters, but this fresh water filter wasn't bad."
"I wonder if this filter is legit, even it has the same model number as the original one came with the fridge. it has very bad water flow, it starts fast but after like 1 day it just slow down a lot. it takes 15+ seconds to fill a 8 oz class now. it was $29 now it's $46 after less than a month. makes me think it's a bad patch that amazon had. I'm not really happy with it. I would return it if I could.Edit:it's 7/30, the water flow is so slow that it will take more one a minute to fill a glass. I'm sure it's the filter, because if I remove the filter the dispenser is very fast. also the water pressure is also good in my house. I'm going to home depot and get a filter there."
"They do the job.  Price is right,"
"I replaced the old filter in my refrigerator with this and it works well so far. You will want to flush the filter before you begin drinking as it will taste and smell a bit on first use. However, once that passes it works splendidly."
It does what it should be doing. Good price andit is easy to re-purchase in Amazon.
"Worked in the Samsung refrig as stated, no issues, simple to install.  no problems.  Much cheaper than if I went to a local store.  I bought two so that when I get down to the last one inserted I will buy again.  Saving the cost of going to the retail big box stores."
"Was looking for water filters for my fridge and didn't want to drive all over town looking for the ones I needed.  Found them online easily, got them in a timely manner, original packaging, brand name.  Great customer service and follow-up.  I will definitely be ordering from this vendor in the future."
It was easy to install and was the right one got my refrigerator.
"I am weary to use the off brand filters, but we've been purchasing these filters from Amazon for years and they always work great. We've saved a lot as compared to buying theses from the retail store, and for some reason, the single pack is cheaper than the multi-pack."
"This is the only filter that will work with our Samsung refrigerator.  It's ridiculous that we cannot buy another, more generic brand filter.  We've tried them all, and they make the refrigerator make a very loud growling noise.  I give this one 3 stars because it works well, but it does not last as long as it should, and it is overpriced."
fit well and was easy to install
"Provides clean, good-tasting water.  However I feel it's overpriced for what it is.  Gotta pay it, though.  Wouldn't want to go back to tap water straight out of the sink."
woks as expected
Works exactly like the ones I was buying locally.
"I can only guess the poor quality of these replacement filters is by design, forcing the customer to buy them several times per year.  In general, all of my Samsung appliances are garbage.  These are the worst appliances I have ever owned, but back to the filter....  After a few months the water stops coming out of the dispenser, we have even had a repairman here to look at it and his answer was the filter needed changing. I have had to replace one in February 2016, May 2016, August 2016 and now as I am typing this review in October 2016, the water does not dispense.  Of course, when I remove the filter, the water dispenses perfectly fine  The only filter that has lasted longer than a few months was the original filter it came with."
"This water filter was recommended by Samsung——a little expensive, but it works great."
This is the filter that comes with the fridge.  No complaints.  Pops up the change filter notification every six months of use.  No need to run a few gallons of water before use which is a nice change.  Screw it in and you are good for another six months.
"While as a practical matter I actually hate the fridge this filter fits, it's no fault of the filter. That being said, ordering this item through Amazon was GREAT because it's been sort of hard to find and I've paid around $50 for one, so naturally cheaper and delivered to my door is far superior."
Samsung recommended filter. Very pricy but it lasts almost six months
Fit my Samsung perfect and without leaking at a lower price than in the local hardware store.
"Works well and easy to install. But a pain to run 2 gallons if water through it to ""flush"" the filter. Never had to do this with GE Profile"
Easy to install. Good value
Please don’t buy these filter cartridges. Thought they were genuine but their packaging and print quality made me think twice and I went to Homedepot to take a second look. Now that at Homedepot was clearly genuine. It had an aluminum seal on it and an authentic magnetic strip. The packaging was also totally different and you could tell the difference in quality. The print quality on the box was also laser sharp and not blurry as this one. Please don’t buy this one. It’s your health at stake and amazon should remove this product from their market!
It's a Samsung-branded water filter.  Fit perfectly in my Samsung fridge.  Will buy again in another 6 months.
"After delayed shipping they sent me the wrong filter.  It seems difficult to find the regular water filter as there is one that gives ""mineral water"".  Those are everywhere; I wanted the plain old water filter.  I was sent the ""mineral water"" filter.  The water is fine, taste is okay, just NOT what I asked for, if that matters to anyone."
"I was hesitant to purchase an aftermarket filter after reading their reviews, so I purchased this name brand product to ensure the expected quality and fit. I was not disappointed. I am completed satisfied with the fit and performance of this product and would recommend to others. The filter was delivered in a timely manner using standard shipping."
We were able to order the needed filters in a efficient and reasonable price by using Amazon.  We use Amazon often to get the things that are not readily available in our area.  Our new refrigerator will need the filters one of these days and we are happy to have them on hand.
Expensive filter but required to maintain warranty on a new refrigerator.
Works great  and delivery great
Perfect fit excellent buy
"While a replacement water filter is not very exciting, the only way it could be any more convenient to get it off your to-do list would be for your neighbor to bring one over and pop it in for you.The price is good, delivery is always excellent with Amazon, and the filter is working great 4 months in."
"Best Price I have found.They fit right in. Water tasted better right away. I found that they lasted about 4 months with 4 adults. They say 6 when you go to a store to get them, but the pressure from the dispenser was diminished after about 4 so keep an eye on that.Sears wanted t$85 bucks for 2."
Not too much I can say. I have A Samsung Refrigerator that requires using these. The water seems to taste better than what I get from my faucet. They seem to work well and I've been using these filters for several years.
We have bought this product several times. The past two filters have stopped working well short of their 6-month lifespan. It is disappointing as these filters cost almost as much as printer ink.
This product is great my is clearer and cleaner
"Cheaper than purchasing at the store, so it was a great deal for us."
We are happy with our purchase and glad we spent the extra money on the name brand.
Fast delivery and a good price for this item.
Great product. Removes that nasty taste from tap water.
I couldnt find the right filter at first but then found it on Amazon for much less than the official site. There was a video on the Samsung site showing how to install it.  Product worked as advertised.  Only issue is the frequency of having to change an expensive filter on the Samsung refrigerator
Good price
"Works perfectly, easy to install, ease of mind of top quality product and super fast delivery.  Thank you so much!"
"Only the Samsung filters don't leak in my fridge, skimping out damaged my floor on my last attempt."
Quick shipping. Item as described and fits our Samsung refrigerator perfect. thanks!
"I was very exited to order for the first time. The 2 refrigerator filters for my Samsung refrigerator and to my disappointment the first filter never filter the water properly from the first day there was a defective charcoal or part so I had to use the second water filter when there are suppose to last at least 4-6 month, NOT VERY HAPPY.The second filter is working fine from the first time."
Read other reviews that it wouldn't work on their fridges. Worked great on mine. My model is RF28JBEDBSR
"Even though sold as Samsung filter, it clearly looks like a knock-off! The print on the label looks like a copy on high quality printer. Missing on the filter is the magnetic strip that comes in the OEM Samsung filter. I ordered based on the picture shown, but when the actual product arrive and compared it with the original filter I had that just expired (bought it from Lowes), I could see clear differences.Beware of purchasing OEM Samsung filters on Amazon. I would not buy again. Buy from Lowes or Home Depot. You pay bit more but guaranteed to get original product."
Works great
"Fit easily and functions well. I had to turn off the water on mine in order to change it, but once I did it came right off. I ran about 15 gallons of water through before it tasted right."
Costly yes but defined genuine and what’s the price for your health? Fits great
"Quite expensive. Have no way to check claims, but the fridge they are for is terrific. Hopefully the filters are, too. Easy to install."
Arrived within 2 days and was very easy to put in!
"Good product, but exorbitantly priced, so that buyers opt for third-party substitutes, many of which seem to be of mediocre quality."
Awesome product
I've ordered these for fridge because they are made by Samsung. This one leaks all over floor. Had to put old one back in and reorder. This was delivered 7/11/20 and can't be returned. Hope Samsung gets their manufacturing more consistent.
"I bought the two pack. As this is a new refrigerator, I wanted to stay with the Samsung brand to insure warranty compliance.  The first filter failed after about a week. Water from the frig had a plastic taste to my wife and a spoiled oranges taste to me.  Put the second filter in and problem went away.  These are expensive filters. Next time, buy generic. Bet they last more than a week."
So happy I decided to check Amazon for our Samson water filters. Much better price and will continue buying.
"Ordered pack of 3. First one worked great, it was about time for replacement as I hit 6 months mark, so installed second filter. Per instruction I flushed over 3 gallons water. Initially water was cloudy, slowly it cleared after 3 gallons. But I still see white web like remains in water even after running another 15 gallons over last 2 days. It very little 2-4 mm web like particles floating in water that don't go away no matter how much water we dispense. So I got rid of 2nd filter and tried the 3rd one in box, same issue."
"There were cheaper ones and buying original factory replacements is expensive, but, usually you can trust them more than the""knock offs""."
"Compatible and works perfectly fine with my fridge.  The previous no names what I've got had the water flow through the dispenser kind of clogged, but using this one the flow is excellent !"
Just what I was looking for.  Very accurate
"Very expensive, but it works."
Works as intended. Needs a replacement every 6 months. Simple to install.
Don't waste your money on aftermarket cheap filters get the Samsung brand of filters and you'll be a happy customer they're worth the money
Great value
"These filters work great, I'm sad to say. I wish the cheap knock-offs were reliably as good, but I've only had a 50% hit rate on those. I'll probably stick with buying genuine at least for a while."
"I don't think you can find an alternative.  This is it.  Therefore, shop for the least expensive store.  It works, easy to replace.  I don't even have to turn off the water valve.  The instruction is easy to follow."
Work great and don't leak. Don't get the off brands. They leak and don't have the extra filter stage.
I just needed a replacement filter for my fridge.  It worked perfectly.
Great buy and great brand.  Thanks Amazon on another great item in stock that is hard to find elsewhere.  It filters the water from the fridge very well.  Also easy to install and comes with replacement reminder stickers to not let you forget to change it out around six months.
perfect replacement.. just wish the refrig itself was a better quality. Samsung refrigerators are a POS
Taste is a little off but good overall.
This was really good it worked & it came exactly has it said it would be
Good price and no problem with the replacement part.
Worth the replacement and good water.
Excellent item.
"OEM product, fit right in the slot and working great."
Great product.
Accept no substitutes
"Since the price is relatively equal to the local Home Depot, I enjoy ordering this online with the Amazon prime, get it in two days and less hassle.  The filter lasts about 6 months and is easier to change than other models I've had in the past, so changing these is not a big hassle."
Good deal
Samsung refrigerator!
Great taste!
Easy to install
Works as expected.
Excelente
Perfect fit for our refrigerator. Just wish it didn't have to be changed so often since it is expensive.
This filter is the exact same one that came with your refrigerator so you can't go wrong.  Water is great tasting now thanks to replacing filter.  Cheaper here than at Best Buy you can't go wrong.
Works great
Fit perfectly and now we are back in business with clean water and a back up filter. Good Price compared to other sites including the Manufacture.
Right on
Easy and simple.
"Authentic,Best Price,Well quality Samsung Filters,Big time difference on the taste of the water,exact fit for the supported models"
Easy installation working fine
"If you change your filter every six months, as suggested, this is expensive and annoying. You would either buy or store the filters too often.  It does work and the noise from the refrigerator has decreased greatly."
Great product great value
Product arrived appropriately wrapped and intact. This product does its job as described.
Great original part
It was easy to install and a good price.
"Received order within 3 days! Container is different but they sent a letter explaining the change in the container style/look & assured us that it was an original Samsung filter, not a knock-off. Have not tried them yet but am hopeful they are the real deal!  Would order from them again."
Labeling is very clear so you know you are ordering the correct filter for your frig. Instructions are in the packaging and what's nice is there is a sticker for the month you replaced your filter if you don't trust the frig reminder.
Excellent product. Works goodExcellent price as well. I’ll definitely recommend this one.
This has to be an off brand filter!  I installed in my fridge and it literally would make the loudest noise and hardly any water would come out!  Went to Lowe’s purchased a new one and installed and it worked perfectly!  Couldn’t return to Amazon as I missed the return window as their filter would only mess up intermittently.  Won’t ever buy again even if it is cheaper.
"I found this product to work as expected, however I did not realise they cost this much money when I purchased to refrigerator.This vendor however had a lower than normal price and shipped the product to me very fast. I would most defiantly use and recommend using them to order this product.Thank you,Billy"
Use oemOff brand hole too small
"Nothing works like the original. After reading horror reviews on ""replicas"" and ""compatible"" products, I decided I will not take a chance.Spend a little more and buy an original. This was a good deal too."
EASY TO INSTALL.  WHY DOES IT COST SO MUCH?
"This filter worked great in our fridge.  When I looked up my previous orders, I purchased the last one a little over a year ago.  I paid in the low thirties for it.  Came back to purchase another. Update** 2nd one only lasted 5 months, 3rd one never seemed right and lasted less than a month.  Disappointed. Had a really hard time installing it. Should have returned it right away."
"Our light was on, so we got this filter"
"LOL...what does one say about a water filter?? My water tastes fine, but, I did notice that, once I put in the new filter, my water started coming out MUCH slower. I followed the installation instructions (it wasn't rocket science!), so, I know that it's installed correctly."
Water doesn't taste very good
Filters just fine and fit my fridge as advertised. Easy install and reset. The only thing i would mention is that the fridge water will spurt a little till the filter has been broken in a bit. Nothing huge but it caught me off guard at first.
"Nothing bad to say after installing the samsung filter. After installing the filter, make sure to do a filter reset or else the ice machine stops working and you freak out that you can't make ice anymore. I should know."
Fits perfectly.Water tastes fine!Finding it and making sure it was the correct one was painful.
"Did it's job, but costly to replace every 6 months"
I did not know I had a choice for fresh water or mineral water.  I was sent mineral water.  Seems to be okay.
Even though the model code is the same these filters are different than they used to be. The nozzle is slightly different and now my water dispenser doesn't work. Waiting for the repairman to see why and how much to repair.
Worked with my Samsung fridge.  You will need to turn the water supply off to connect the filter properly or you will have water all inside the fridge.  I found this out the hard way.  The connection must be perfect.
Expensive but it is what we need for the fridge.  Have ordered multiple times now and will continue to do so.
"Doesn't last very long.  Works great initially, but after 3 months water/ice starts to taste bad after 3-4 glasses of water and ICE a day.  Plus these filters have really shot up in price, nearly double since Dec of 2015."
Packaged great. Worth the extra money to buy this one that fits fridge. Went in with no problem.
Good
Great
"I compared the filter replacement with the original that came with my Samsung and though I did not see spelling mistakes, I did notice that the plastic housing and label looked of very low quality.9/27/2014 Update: well so far it has worked well so I've updated my rating to 5."
Exactly what I needed.
"Came packaged well, in the manufacturer's original packaging.  Easy to install.  Glad to have filtered water... I just wish Samsung didn't gouge us on the pricing."
As per described
Great
These are not authentic Samsung filters they do not have the verifiable barcode and the water does not taste any different than tap water!  I am furious this was purposely misleading!
Same price as on the Samsung site.  Easy install (which is actually kudos to fridge design)
The filter was so much cheaper and worked just as well as the one from the store.
""
Has performed well for many months now.
"Very disappointed. it fits and didn't leak, but after only 2 months water flow has slowed down to a trickle. Took it out and examined for obstruction found none, and put original filter back in for test and it worked great. Put this filter back in: sslllooowwww. Supposed to last at least six months. Spent  a lot of money for junk filter.UPDATE: After almost a year now on the original filter, wife wanted it changed so I put second replacement (I bought 2 at the same time) filter in. Again, after a few weeks, slowed down to a trickle. I went to Best Buy where i bought the refrigerator and bought a guaranteed Samsung replacement. We'll see if it performs like the original."
"I like the product definitely, but I hate being cheated"
Never buy aftermarket filters for a Samsung they always seem to have issues. This fit perfectly and works great.
Good clean water
What I needed
Good price!
"There was a few drops of water leaking every time I used the dispenser after I installed tgd filter, but that stopped after 2 days."
"I have tried the lowest priced and I was burned,  The ice maker would make a ""rattling"" noise internally, and the water from the door made the same awful sound.  As soon as I popped this one in, everything went back to normal. Water now flows freely and taste great."
This is a genuine Samsung filter. The cheaper versions I have seen do not filter out any sediment or contaminants only chlorine. Be sure to only buy Samsung filters for the most effective filtering.
"Had to search for something other than a single filter or a 4 pack, but found that you can actually order 2.  these are the filters that fit this fridge."
OEM Part = OEM QualityI don't have time for stuff that does not work or does not fit right.  20min to get a water filter to install is just not worth it.  The OEM part works perfectly with no issues.
Works well!
Works as it says
Price
Easy to install
This is the water filter required for our refrigerator. It works well and lasts quite awhile before needing to be replaced. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The Amazon customer reviews were helpful. It was well packaged and arrived on schedule.
Good product
Love it!
"Does what it needs to do.  I connected my RO to my refridgerator now, though, and so I no longer need a filter.  This was a good price - best I could find.  I was very happy I found it here and happier now that I don't need it!"
"After trying 3rd party filters which failed within a few days, I purchased this original Samsung filter with high expectations. After a few weeks went by, I was confident that I purchased a good product. However, the filter totally blocked up after only 2 months of normal,  if not lower than normal household use. Would try this again, but I am hesitant since the cost is high and not justified with only 2 months of use."
Compatible with our Samsung. Price was average
"Thank you, it was actually kinda hard tracking that filter in my area. So thanks again for coming through for me."
"Works great. No taste. Wondering if it takes out toxins and chemicals from chemical and toxic spills into river and drinking supply. Specifically, the coal ash spill into the Dan River in NC for 70 miles. Guess we'll find out in about 10-15 yrs."
I tried to buy a knock off filter for my fridge when I couldn't find the Samsung brand. It was a horrible decision. The water was aweful. I will not make that mistake again.
Great but pricey ended up buying offbrand ones that work just as well and cheaper
Great buy
it works
Thanks for everything ! Amazing product !As promised and everything as expected .
"So my Samsung refrigerator needed a new water filter. I thought ""Oh no. Wonder how difficult this is going to be to replace."" It wasn't! I found the best price on Amazon, ordered it, took out the old one and replaced with the new one in less than 2 minutes!"
Great replacement. It looked a bit skinnier than original but it works just fine.
Works perfectly in our Samsung fridge. This is the second one we have ordered over time. Easy to install. No issues with water taste.
Refrigerator
This is the real deal. You can buy an OEM version at Home Depot for half the price but it does not fill the ice maker completely and you get small ice cubes.
"I have a Samsung refrigerator. I needed a new water filter. They work very well and the water has no taste, which was the goal. Removal of old filter and installation of new filter was very easy."
I tried using my French door refrigerator without the filter for a while. You can definitely tell a difference with the filter in. The water is crisp and clean. The only thing I don't like is that you have to run 3 gallons through the filter before you should use it.
"Quick shipping. Haven’t used it yet, as it is a spare for our Samsung refrigerator."
One worked great.  The other one shot back out at us after we turned the water pressure back on.  Hoping I can return the bad one.
"We've been using this filter since purchasing our fridge 5 years ago. Works perfectly. Our city water is chlorinated, and we subsequently taste or smell zero chlorine when using the fridge for drinking water."
Using it because it's designed for Samsung refrigerator.
This product reliably met the need for a new water filter for our Samsung fridge. Using the genuine part is often a good plan.
"Unit was received and installed, as usual.  There had been discussions about counterfeit units on the market, but this seemed genuine and is installed without leaks."
What can you say.  It was the Samsung water filter I needed and I didn't have to run around town looking for one.
LOVE LOVE LOVE changing our filter!  It's the worst when that light comes on and your water starts to trickle out of the dispenser.  These are a must.  I should probably put them on auto-ship.  Will consider this for the future.
Water filter is a bit overpriced but what is $30 for 6mos of filtered water?  Used to buy bottled water every week for my drinking needs.  Saving quite a bit of money now with this setup on my new Samsung fridge!
"This is a review of the filters shipped as a 2-pack from Asus Wholesale not the single pack, 3-pack or 2-pack that may ship from a different vendor. These filters are obviously from very old stock, the label looking entirely different than the new version. And although this old version has the same model number as and looks virtually identical to the newer filter, close inspection will show it's not exactly the same. The inner nozzle on this filter is slightly shorter than the collar but the nozzle is flush with the collar on the new version. This results in an improper seal causing the filter to leak. The inner baffling in the nozzle is also different though I'm not certain that has any effect. If you have a newer refrigerator I'd avoid this filter if you don't want to risk damaging your kitchen flooring."
Easy to replace.
"Ordered and re-ordered again this filter for our refrigerator and both times it has been perfect.  We love the Samsung refrigerator and since these filters are easy to install, it makes using it even more pleasurable."
"It was so nice to find this online. I will definitely order again. I've purchased Sears parts before, and ended on a ""wild goose chase"". And then invariably, I buy the wrong thing, and cannot get various stores to take it back. Ordering through this seller was a dream."
Having to change twice per year at $50 per filter
Perfect fit for Samsung fridge. Fast shipping and cheaper than the local store.I do like that you can set this filter up as a reoccurring order for every 6 months
"It's a Samsung water filter for a Samsung fridge.  It fits, and seems to filter the water.  So hey, it works. It's kind of pricey, but you already knew that.What else are you seeking to learn by investing your time reading a review of such a mundane product?"
👍
It fict perfectly and was very easy to change out.
Stick with the Samsung brand and not a replacement type. You may pay a little more but it's well worth it. Some of the replacements were found to leak and not fit as well. Take it from one who tried.
No issues.
Worked really well on no leaks like on cheaper versions.
"BEWARE - there is something wrong with this filter.  Our water flow slowed down tremendously.  This is labeled as an authentic Samsung filter so I didn't think it was the issue.  We had been dealing with it for months, then finally couldn't take it anymore and tried to figure out was was wrong.  Sure enough, it was the filter.  Too late to return it, but I will never purchase my refrigerator filter from Amazon again.  I knew something was fishy when my filter didn't come with a date sticker, but didn't think much of it at the time.  This was about $20 cheaper through Amazon, but I guess now I know why.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT.  I went to a local Lowe's and bought one for $50.  When I put it it in the water flow was immediately better."
Needed new one for my fridge. Got it fast and at a good price.
Easy to get and put in and lasts good!
"Please read this!This filter only filters about 20% of contaminants. We tested several times.Tap water particulates straight from our sink were at 600 ppmWe tested a Starbucks iced water we purchased in the morning for Breakfast - around 80 ppmThe water coming from this Samsung filter was about 520 ppm - that is only a 12% Reduction!Ordered a 2nd filter, thinking maybe the first was a defect.The 2nd filter did about the same - 520ppm - only a 12% Reduction in contaminants.This item should not have a 4.5 Star rating. Please test your water!  And please write reviews based on real data. This filter DOES NOT work!Amazon: Please remove this item.  Why are you selling things that are lying about what they do?"
"An exact replacement for the OEM filter on this unit. Has a bayonet style mount, which seems difficult to replace when the old one is removed. This is because it is pressurized. You have to push it in hard to turn it. You won't break it, or the refrigerator. Works flawlessly."
Great price
Just what I needed to keep the cool filtered water coming in Florida.  We tend to be thrifty so we reset the.filter setting once then when it calls for a new filter again we change it out.  Got the new one through Amazon because it is easier than shopping for one.
"This OEM filter works perfectly as expected. It supplies great tasting water and removes many toxins, according to the literature that accompanies them."
The water filter fit perfectly in our Samsung refrigerator.
Easy to order easy to install water filters!!!
"Muy buen producto, con gusto lo comprare otra vez. lo recomiendo al 100%"
Great product and good price on subscribe and save
Recently purchased this for our 1 year old Samsung.  it was the 2nd filter we replaced.  (the first one was replaced by a plumber).  Contrary to other reports; you must turn the water off.  We did not and it leaked gallons of water.  We turned the water off and it leaked for another 6 hours.  When it was completely dry; we turned the water on and no water!  Finally had to call a repairman ($80 thank you very much).  He said the filter was installed improperly.  We don't understand that.  There was only one way to install; one way to lock it.  Needless to say; we will ignore the change filter light in the future.  The instructions were very vague.  Amazon is not at fault here; but Samsung is.
Easy installation
I shopped around online an this is the cheapest I have found. Other then that it it does what it is to do. I just wish they would come down in price. I did get free shipping with Amazon Prime which is awesome!
Replaced easily and pretty good deal.
Exactly as described
"If you are looking to replace your current Samsung water filter with a quality product that works, at a reasonable price this is the item you want.  It arrived on time, properly packaged, with detailed instructions and most importantly it works as expected."
"These  filters are excellent. They made a great difference in water taste, there is no after taste at all. Even when measuring the solid particles, they were greatly reduced, even more so than the original filters that came with the refrigerator. I am a scientist, and this difference is definitely quantifiable."
Came on time & easy to install.
Wish these things were less expensive though worked perfectly in my new(er) Samsung fridge and...no leaks!
"Exact OEM replacement, works just as expected. Any of these types of maintenance items are a bit pricey in my opinion.  Will probably connect line to whole home reverse osmosis unit in the future thus eliminating the need to replace this filter."
Works well. Fits perfectly.
used this product for 2 years now. Replaced every 6 months. easy to install and no fails so far.
So much cheaper than the local warehouse
Easier than running to the hardware store.
"Lasts quite a while. It's still filtering well even though my fridge says I should change it. It's the very same one that can be purchased at the hardware store, but this is a much better price."
Love that I don’t need to make a Home Depot run!!
"This filter has only one O-ring at the top.  Otherwise it looks just like the one it is replacing.  However, it causes the refrigerator to make a lot of noise - not while filtering water, but whenever the compressor is running.  Had this same problem when I was using cheap replacement cartridges (non-Samsung) and it stopped immediately when I went back to an original Samsung a few months ago.  With this replacement though, the noise has started again."
"Since these are Samsung product they work as they should in my Samsung fridge. It does seem like they are a little looser than the original, but no leaks are seen. The dual pack is nice because you get a nice price break and only have to order once a year."
"I purchase this filter every six months for my Samsung refrigerator, as it is suggested to replace the filter at that time, and I think it is best to use the manufacturer's part.  The filter seems to work fine, and is relatively easy to replace."
These work as they should! Real Samsung!
It is what I expected it to be.
Great price and timely delivery.  Thank you!
Works good.  Watch out for knock-offs that leak water.
"no me agrado porque solo me duro un mes y precio muy alto , pareciao que hera usado"
Too expensive. Ridiculous pricing.
"I have purchased this product twice, one package had great water flow. Second batch purchased October of 2018 has low water flow in all three filters. This has been a problem with other suppliers, something about the gasket area not activating enough water flow. Ice maker works, filter filters water but the flow is very, very slow. I am now trying to figure out how to get replacements. If you purchase, check at least one filter as soon as it arrives. Be sure it flows a good flow as some discount or counterfeit units, sold as ""Genuine Water Filter"" with the reflective label certificate do not flow proper water quantity."
Refrigerator filter
A Samsung cartridge and was just the same as the one that came in our refrigerator. I had to turn off the water in order to get it in due to the pressure. Don't forget to reset the filter icon.
Bought the filters because they were supped to be the same as what was originally in the refrigerator.  I was a little confused because of the different part numbers so I called Samsung. They did not really know what the difference was but they said they should work. Works great.
"What the refrigerator calls for, great price, convenient 3 pack"
Good value what compared to big box stores
OEM replacement filters for my fridge. Do not have to buy bottled water when I have these
"I have bought these over and over. They are a tad pricey, but last a really long time. Buy the two pack for better savings."
"This is the second one we have bought for our new frig. The first one worked good and never failed letting water thru. Wish you could get ice cream out of it ever once in a while, but water is good."
Came on time directions are terrible I had to call Samsung
ITS A FILTER AND FITS
"Fit well and doesn't leak...assume the water is filtering but it's second stage in process so hard to tell.Water is tasteless and colorless, about all you can ask for from a filter."
"drop in replacement. We were shocked how much stronger the flow was after replacing the filter. Apparently, 12 months with our water hardness is too long. FWIW, I broke the old filter (same model #) open, its a compressed slug of activated charcoal."
I bought this for my dad after the non Samsung brand ones only lasted a few weeks. They might be more expensive but worth it in the long run.
"Good, clean water coming our of our water dispenser in our Samsung Refrigerator. if you need one, that fits with your fridge then order it."
"I don't know why these are so expensive, but Amazon provides a great service. I like the idea of not having to search for one in a retail store. It arrives at my door every time and works as it should"
Product is easy to instal water taste great.
Pricey but the water is pure
great price and delivery
"Pricey, but fits great with no leaks. Better tasting water. And rated NSF/ANSI 42 & 53!"
satisfied
Fits perfectly. No issues.
Great filters. Never have had any trouble with them. Wish I could say the same for the ice maker on the fridge we have! These are high quality and easy to install.
Right product. Easy to install in spite of the multi language product sheet that looked so confusing.
This was a good price and the product works well too.  Keeps the water clean and the ice in the ice maker as well.  No after taste in the water.  I use these a lot and I wouldn't  want to have a refrigerator without one.
This is a great diffuser. Does exactly as it says it does. My wife and I have used many and this one is perfect for the money.
I only buy Samsung water filters for my Samsung refrigerator. That way I know they will never leak. I have had my refrigerator for at least 2 years and have never had trouble with these filters. Why change when you have a good thing?
Good value
We weren’t sure about the size but this was the right one for our fridge
So good fit perfect
"WORKS GREAT,,  no problem replacing current filter, did have to use a pair of pliers to make it turn,, did get a little bit of water, one small hand towel able to mop it all up.  great price."
Removed all the chemical taste
"As advertised... they work great in my Samsung fridge.Easy to replace, no leakage.Great filter."
Fits- water taste good- I'm happy
Works fine the price is the only issue easy to change out
"Bought this in Sept. '16...sat in my cupboard until this month (March)...I never took it out of the package until now...I first noticed the box it came in is damaged and appears to have been opened. I also noticed there was no cap nor washers around the screw in portion. When I installed it, water came ""gushing"" out of the filter compartment. I cleaned up the pool of water on my floor, then re-installed the filter making sure I followed all directions..well...water again poured out of the filter compartment...This filter is defective, unfortunately for me I waited 6 months, as per the changing schedule...so I can't return it. Sooooo this is a warning to all potential buyers who are considering purchasing this filter from this company....DON'T DO IT!"
"This filter is working great for my fridge!  No leaks, water tastes great!"
This was more expensive than a generic brand filter but it solved the problem of a small leak in the drawer when I used a cheaper generic filter. No leak now.
Does not leak!! Aftermarket units I ordered leaked. I bought two and played with first one until it stopped leaking. Gave up on second one and ordered Samsung original. Not a drop of leakage!
Worked perfectlyOnly 4 stars because they are so pricey
"A bit pricey but arrived promptly and was easy to install. It did not, as i had feared, require turning off the water line, and installation was quick and easy and required no tools."
"I was buying the off brand filters, and the flow always seemed to be restricted.  I went back and bought the name brand filter, and it does seem to have much better flow."
fits in our samsung fridge and makes that darn red 'filter out' light go away. does it filter the water any better than the tap? That's the idea but honestly I don't really know. I just got tired of seeing that stupid filter light so got this to shut the fridge up.  :)
Pricy but work well and seem to last longer
Works great
Came during stated timeframe. Used refrigerator's user manual as no instructions came in product box. So far working well. Filtered water seems fine. Only had it one day so not sure about going forward. Time will tell.
"I was a little worried about ordering the right filter for our fridge.  But I called Samsung, as my filter was previously a 20A and this is a 20B.  She explained, they are the same thing - just a different batch.  Soooo, thankfully it works!  We love having the filtered water as where we live, there's a really bad sulfur problem!"
exactly what we needed to replace our water filter in the samsung fridge
"Perfect fit, OEM."
"One of those cases where it makes more sense to go with the manufacturer's own product instead of a cheaper alternative.  Suddenly we had water pressure from the cold water again, and ice was made quickly.  And Amazon sent it faster than promised."
Water filter for our model fridge
"They do the job removing odors and odd taste, last about six months. Alternate brands don't seem to work as well or last as long. You get what you pay for with the OEM cartridge"
This filter was exactly what I needed.  We had a water boil alert and everyone was rushing around to change refrigerator filters which were sold out everywhere. I was able to get mine quickly online!!  Thank you!
"Bought the knockoff one by accident the first time and wasn't happy. It didn't fit right in the fridge and although it appeared to work ok, I just didn't trust it. This is the filter that was designed to work with your Samsung refrigerator. It fits right and works great."
"These are originals, and fit our refrigerator perfectly. They cost less than they do at our local hardware store and they are delivered to the front door. What's not to like?"
Easy to change out.  better than paying the expensive prices from Samsung or a retail store!
"Fits perfectly in the refrigerator and had no problem installing.  The water doesn't really taste any different, but the flow pressure increased when I changed the filter, which meant that the older unit had restrictions, or filtered debris from the municipal water system.  thank you"
As advertised.  Great price for a 3-pack of the actual Samsung brand water filter.  Fast shipping.  Not sure how you would rate the workmanship of a water filter otherwise.  Been using it for a month now with no issues...
"Fits my Samsung side-by-side perfectly.  Identical to the old one.  Easy to replace.  I turned the water off at the manabloc beforehand, so almost no water was spilled in the process."
"Good price for the real thing.  Don't be taken by those knockoff look alike garbage counterfeits. Remember, your consuming the water that coming out of these filters."
"Bought the three pack, which made them quite a bit cheaper. They work well with no issues!"
"Shipped fast. Great filtration. Yes, its more expensive than the knock-offs, but worth it to our family to have safe drinking water with no leaks."
"I assume it is filtering the water.  It fits and doesn't leak, and that is all I know for sure."
"Original filter, fit samsung french door fridge with no problems. Took a few seconds to fit and comes with handy date sticker to let you know when you last changed the filter. For the price no real reason to compromise and risk the quality of the filtered water or damaging the fridge."
Meh
"These sell for $50 each  - WHEN YOU CAN FIND THEM.  I either have to go to Sears or Lowe's to buy these, neither of which is close to me.  The two pack is awesome, delivered right to my house, and a sweet price."
"Everyone in the house is remarking about the ""particles"" in the water. It has to be the filter. I have tried to ignore it but others keep commenting. IDK But I would not purchase this again."
"No issues, seems to have worked perfectly."
"I am stuck with two (2) filters that do not fit and cannot be returned,  Another review stated that the design of this model  was altered and not suitable for refrigerators built when mine was, Oct.2018.I am upset because a recall should have gone out to  rectify this problem and I don't have to be out of almost $80.  Please advise me of my recourse. DH"
good price
"It is a filter, it arrived, I opened the box, removed the protective plastic, turned the water off, removed the old filter and disposed of it, installed the new filter and turned the water back on."
These work in my refrigerator as stated.
It's the original and made by Samsung for Samsung so I expected no problems and got it!  Has the NSF rating and it is suppose to last 6 months.  Easy to to remove and install.  Just cut the water supply off first.
Fridge
I can really count on these Samsung Refrigerator Water Filters. This is my 4th one …and I haven't been disappointed yet.It's a relief not to have to go looking everywhere in order replace a filter that is always  going to be needed.
They work but what else can you say about a water filter
Good
Ease of putting it in
My newer samsung fridge was making a ratcheting sound when I used the water dispenser.  When I changed the filter the noise totally went away and the water flow is better now.
Good deal and works as described
"What can I say about a water filter... it filters the water, and installing it made the red filter light on my fridge go away."
"I was looking for  replacement filter without having to spend $50 and $60 for one, which is what they cost from places like Best Buy where I originally purchased my refrigerator..  It was exactly like the one that came with my refrigerator at half the cost!!!!!"
Simple install steps.Have bought this 3 times now. I think these last about 9-12 months. (Depends on usage ofcourse - we are only 2 ppl).
Gave much better pressure than the off brand versions. Water also seemed to taste cleaner. Also doesn't make as much noise as other off brands when using. I would pay more for this name brand filter any day.
Like this filter well purchase again
This filter is recommended by Sears because Sears sold me the filter from their online parts store. I have replaced the filter in the refrigerator and it is working fine. I recommended to Sears that they explain the different serial numbers since these define higher level filtration.
I replace the filter in the Refrigerator every 6 mo
The original filter worked really good.  We just installed the 1st of the two filters.  The water to me taste at little different.  My wife can't tell any difference.  Maybe it's just me but that's why only 4 stars.
Does the job.
Good
"My samsung fridge has to take the OEM product, I tried buying a generic and it totally backfired. I don't know why these things are so speedy, but this thing works."
The product came fast. Easy to install
"Great price on filters. Some of the reviews said they received a 'new' style filter which didn't fit, but the filters I received were identical to the factory filter."
The filter light is still on even after following the instructions...
Needed a new filter for my fridge. Oddly it was cheaper to buy 4 individually rather than the 3 or 6 pack. It was $15 cheaper than anywhere I could find them at a brick and mortar.
I was very happy with the choice of  color and design. The texture was also great. Soft on the feet.
Good true advert
Easy to purchase on Amazon but disappointing that we have to install every 6 months with only two of us using ice.  We have a water purifier so don't use the water dispenser on the fridge.  Wish they lasted longer....we just ignore the light past 6 mos.
Even I could install this water filter!
Perfect fit for our Samsung refrigerator at a much more reasonable price. Glad this item is available on Prime!
Does not do a good job of filtering the water!
This is our 3rd purchase and these filter fit nicely and work well. We have only had to change them once per year so far.
Water tastes great!  Would have given it 5 stars if it was easier to change.  Suction makes it difficult to grasp.  A better handle would be helpful.
Fit perfectly and got them cheaper.  Worth buying the original
This is the correct part and works like it should.  We have had very bad luck with other than OEM filters. Wish I could find them on sale.
"Relatively expensive compared to the knock-offs, but at least these work, (I tried an off-brand before ordering this and was getting no water out of it.)"
"This was the first time I had to replace the water filter in my new Samsung refrigerator.  I determined the filter I needed, ordered it, and, when it arrived, I changed out the filter without a problem.  When I need to replace the filter again, I will order it from Amazon."
"Well, it's not like you have a great deal of choice when it comes to your fridge filter, but this is an original manufacturer filter for a great price, in my case $10 less than the big-box stores. Super deal."
Works as it should. Easy to install and water tastes great.
"Our municipal water is the best in the country. So why do we use a filter and drink water out of the refrigerator? Beats me, but we do. And this filter makes our awesome water even more awesome-er!"
It lasts just about the 6 months that is recommended.  After that the taste of the water changes for the worse.  I replace the filter and yummy water again.
it's the real deal.  Replacement is easy with this filter.  Last me and my family 3 months minimum.
i always try to buy the name brand product as I do believe they are the best.  Have had no issues and will continue to make the same purchase when needed.
No different from what I buy at Home Depol
"For the first time I am disappointed by Amazon. I  purchased two Samsung filters and kept them for 6 months.Now time came to replace filters ( every 6 months).  Before purchase I made sure that filters fit my Samsung refrigerator model (RF23M8070SRAA). Now I realized that these filters do not fit to my refrigerator!So Amazon misleaded me. Moreover photo of package says: ""Genuine Samsung Water Filter"".Unfortunately I kept these filters for a long time as spare which is reasonable. I think in such case Amazon must replace them and correct filter description."
None
"Very good price for this water filter, and they work great!  The first one lasted more than 6 months before the change filter light came on."
"Perfect! This filter is actually the right size for my refrigerator. While you can buy other replacements that say they fit, they are not as long and wide as this one. Glad I paid for the brand name in this situation."
"Item as described.  Works without issue.  Other non-Samsung replacements leak, and doesn't filter as well."
"I have ordered this product for a year, but the two I bought recently are different from before, and the price is more expensive. The water that I bought before is blue after installation, and it takes about 5 gallons of water to be clear.  Water can be used. After the water is boiled, there is a lot of alkali in the water. After reading many reviews, this product is fake. I think it is too."
"Super satisfied with the product and the price.  I prefer buying original parts, especially when my refrigerator is on warranty or extended warranty,  In which case you cannot be told that you haven't followed manufacturers guidelines."
Bought generic and now trying to return since it leaked. Dont waste your time and just buy the brand name one for this filter.
"Gave this one star because zero is not an option.  The overall rating was good so unfortunately I didn't read the comments which should have made it obvious that this is a cheap knockoff and NOT GENUINE SAMSUNG!!  We couldn't get it into the fridge, and I think it actually may have bent or broken the little piece inside the fridge.  When looking at it side by side to my genuine filter, there are small differences.  So awful of Amazon and the seller to market this as genuine.  I am very upset about this.  DO NOT BUY!!"
Very happy with this filter. I use it with my Samsung fridge and the water comes out crisp. This filter also last for a very long time unlike other filter that won't last as long.
This water filter is so easy to install but it cost 4X as much as my last refrigerator which had a Culligan filter.  My guess is they are making a killing on the profits!
Fits like a glove! No leaking or issues getting it installed. Packaging was easy to open and kept the filter from being damaged. Water comes through easily and tastes great. Will definitely order this again.
I haven't used this item yet.  It is a replacement for one just like it & I like that one.  I'm going away for the winter & want my kids to have a replacement available when needed.
Pricey but worked as advertised. Easily installed and no problems with leaking of any kind.
"Local hardware store no longer carries these.  Had to order them on line.  Tried a generic version, but they would not seal properly and I had water all over the inside of the refrigerator."
I love getting filtered water from my frig. I am able to reduce the waste produced from bottled water and is economical. My water tastes great.
We purchased the filter for future installation since is the one that is installed in our refrigerator and the manufacturer has been in business for years. Amazon was able to give the best price and good delivery although we think most of the filters are pricey.
Fit fridge as intended. Easy to replace cartridges.
"I don't know why these things cost so much, but I'm able to buy them here for less than I can get them locally.Despite the high price, they work great, and installation is a breeze."
Water came out too slow and it seem to effect my Ice maker....The ice cubes were too small.  Replaced the filter with another Samsung filter and it corrected the problem.
Excellent; product performs exactly as specified.
Na
Exactly what I ordered. No difference in design from the original (to include the labeling). I don't know what happened to others that claimed they got an incompatible filter. What I ordered worked and the water tastes normal.
Genuine unit and perfect fit. A bit on the pricey side but worth it to get the real McCoy.
Awesome
"Don’t buy from amazon it’s fake. Read the writings and pay attention to the font.Right one is the real one. I’ve always compared it to the original one that came with the fridge. It’s never been a miss from Walmart. (Might not tell in the photos). “Their” printer sucks!Fake product lol. Could not believe Amazon allows this somehow? At least invest in a printer that prints labels using 300dpi...? The most simplest clues, regular consumers will always miss.I’m not about to ruin my 3.5k smart fridge!"
I only purchase the Samsung brand and very satisfied with the money saved by buying this on-line.
"I have bought this filter twice now, and it is the best deal available!  I saved over $20 purchasing this through Amazon rather than at Best Buy (or a similar retailer), and it works just the same!  My last one lasted for about 8 months."
Practical littler thing
Delivered promptly fits perfect
It is the filter I use for my fridge and great price for the purpose.
"Used this filter for a little over a week and I kept getting a funny taste from it, maybe metallic. I started reading previous reviews about these filters possibly being counterfeit and decided to buy new ones from home depot to compare. Sure enough the label from these ones were drastically different from the home depot ones. It was very blurry compared to home depots. I ended up returning these. I haven't had a funny taste from the home depot ones at all."
The filter was good but lasted only 5 months with moderate usage. Had to replace the filter in March and in July.I hope that these filters last longer than 5 months.
perfect replacement for the fridge!
Works well with samsung fridge. Packaging intact and delivered on time.
"Factory water filter replacement.  No issues with the replacement, and no leaks.  Works as it should."
Water filters great value in a three pack. You go to Lowes or Home Depot one day over $50.
"Product works flawless, but the cost is extremely high."
"What can I say I'm hoping it filters my water. The water comes out forcefully when a new one is installed. So I guess it's working. The only complaint I have is it was hard to take old filter out, not much to grab on to to turn."
The filter arrived quickly. Good price. Convenient way to purchase.
"As expected, but they should be for the price!"
"Works well, but too costly. I now use aftermarket at half the price."
"Expensive but offhand products do not work very well, go with the Name Samsung brand"
It's what my fridge needed for a tiny bit less.
Affordable for name brand.
Purchased three pack of water filters for my 4 door Samsung refrigerator.  Received very quickly and was exactly as advertised.  Had a little trouble pulling out the old filter.  Had to push in and turn to get it to release.  New filter went in very easily.
"Good filter but wont be needing them any more as my Samsung refrigerator died after 5 years. I wont need Samsung filters again, EVER!"
Very easy to install in my Samsung Refridgerator. Did not have to turn off the water  - simple twist in.
"We've had our refrigerator since April of 2016. The filter that came with the fridge worked for 6 months without an issue. I've purchased 2 of these filters through Amazon and they've each lasted under a month. Ordered a new filter from Lowe's and compared them when it arrived - even though these are supposed to be exactly the same the one from Lowe's is different (the part that inserts into the water line is longer and only has 1 black rubber ring, whereas the ones I ordered from Amazon have two). I'm hopeful that the one I ordered at Lowe's will work for the six months that it is intended to, instead of the one that I've been getting with the ones from Amazon."
Simple and quick to install and get crisp and delicious odor free water. Out of precaution I did turn the water off and had no issue any kind of leakage. Worked perfectly on my RF4287HARS refrigerator.
These work great and from the literature these filter out more of the nasties than the low cost generics.
"Don't buy these filters. I first bought a replacement filter in June for my Samsung fridge and then after about two months the water pressure from the dispenser dropped. I thought it was the fridge, but upon removing the filter I found that the water pressure returned to normal. Replacing the filter with another one from this same manufacturer resolved the issue and the water pressure was back to normal. However, now the replacement filter also has the same problem. My guess is that these filters are poorly manufactured, knock-offs, or they just don't work for the 6 mo life span that they claim. These will most likely last you 2-3 months or less before getting clogged."
"though some previous reviewers have received knock offs, my cartridge was an authentic Samsung one and worked perfectly in my French door."
Works.
"oh thank God.  it works.These filters are expensive and a pain, typically.  I will continue to order this one, because for once, I don't have a leak."
"Fit as needed easy to install, and cheaper then the Samsung web site."
"Awesome easy to install and replace, Price is comparable to other similar products but when you can go with the same manufacturer for this product for in or around the same price as others its always the best choice, you can taste the difference almost immediately."
"My water has never tasted better, I am SO happy I bought this."
"This lasts about 6 months each. I use my water on the fridge a lot! I drink water all day and use it for my dog and it still makes it through 6 months. Easy in, easy out."
"fishy-the numbers for the product unit are correct-with another set of numbers added in. The picture on the box look good, but the filter isn't the same. This filter is for mineral water and not the fresh water shown & advertised. I sent this one back, Wrote a short letter to check inside the box and make sure it wasn't for mineral water and not fresh water as advertised. The replacement came-the very same one that I sent back. (I'm so glad people do as you ask them-this is a jab). I contacted Lowe's and paid a little more money but I got the correct filter. This isn't a jab to Amazon, but the seller/provider of the filter being sold. Be careful look at everything and ask questions when it comes to items like this."
"A little pricey, but that's what you get when you buy OEM parts.  Simple installation and no leaks."
Perfect replacement for our Samsung side by side with water and ice on door.  Fits perfectly.  No leaks.
Fits and works just like the original.  No leaks.  And they come with a sticker to remind you when to change the filter.
"This is a high quality filter that made an immediate difference to the taste of the water, and in a good way of course.  Do not settler for cheaper no name brand filters.  I have made that mistake before and won't again."
The water tastes great after being run through this filter.
i bought a RF4287 last thanksgiving and a few weeks it shows red sign asking for new filter. Bought this one on Amazon and it fits well. Installation is just a few seconds. It also comes with stickers to mind you when to replace. will buy it every six months.
"I've purchased these filters many times and will continue to do so.  Frank at Steve's Filtering Deals provides excellent and personal customer service, which is a nice surprise when shopping online.  Also, the price for this filter is very reasonable.  Thank you!"
Perfect factory replacement
This is my third filter from Samsung and the water tastes fresh and the ice cubes look just fine.  I'm always afraid to use the NON-name brand products so I feel it's safe to say that using the official Samsung filter is probably the best way to go.
Good price and easy to install.
"This is identical to the filter is pulled out of my French Doors Samsung refrigerator, but a different model number. The filter is easy to insert and remove. This price is much cheaper than any other filters of the same type. I would buy from here agaib"
Don't trust a copy cat item.  Round pegs do not fix well in the square holes that a generic filter has.
As described.
The filter arrived on time and it worked perfect with our refrigerator.
"Easy to install, seems to be as good as the original filter that came with the refrigerator and much less expensive."
Works and installed easily.
Best place to get water filter for my fridge. Ships fast. No issues.
"After reading many reviews of the generics involving faulty, leaky filters, I have stayed with the pricey name brand filters. So far,so good!"
Great price quick delivery
I have no issues with this product just make sure you flush all the air before use. Also I wish water flowed faster but that may be the area I live in and not the refrigerator or filter I have not tried any other filter yet
This is the second time I have ordered this product from amazon and I do use the required filters instead of an off brand.  It always arrives on time and in good condition.  They do a good job of filtering the water.
It worked and the PRICE WAS GREAT .... I will. Be BACK !
I wish these filters were less expensive as the manufacturer suggests replacing them every 6 months
Fits fine. Too expensive.
"Do not buy this product!  We thought it was manufactured according to spec.  When we replaced our filter with this one, not only did we end up with a kitchen full of water from the ensuing leak, but it also broke our housing inside where the filter goes!To make it worse, we waited until we got our tax refund to have the Samsung Repair guy come look at our Fridge filter problem.It is going to cost us almost $500 to repair and replace the filter housing, broken by the knock off filters!  Now when I tried to return them, it is past the 30 days allowed...so not only did we get screwed by the knock off filters, but we cant even get our money back.DO NOT BUY!"
This was the correct filter for my model RF28JBEDBSR/AA model refrigerator.
These filters are a little expensive but they are exactly what they say they are. Works in my refrigerator which calls for them. That's about all I have to say about that.
"Perfect fit, filter changed in under 2minutes!"
"I replaced my Samsung refrigerator's water filter with one of these about a month ago. It was easy to install, and the water tastes good."
"OEM water filter, works fine"
The Samsung fridge wants one of these about every six months and Amazon makes getting a replacement and painless as can be.Update 8/28/2015 - I got the same 'good' part I've always got buying these from Amazon.  the pics tell the story.
Easy to install water taste great
"I have purchased this item before. And like most reviews here, the filter has been changed. I installed this new filter, and it worked great for a couple of weeks. Then I noticed that our laminate floor had started to swell in a few places. I tracked the water back to inside the fridge, right where the filter twists into the filter housing. So, over the last week or so, we have had a steady drip from this new filter, which has caused water damage to 6 or 7 pieces of our laminate floor. Not very pleased with this ""genuine"" filter. Currently, the water is turned off to the fridge, as I'm not exactly sure what my next steps will be."
Easy to replace
It works just fine but is waaaay too much money for what it is
lasts quite a long time so worth the money. better taste than my 3M under sink filter too!
Does it's thing
"Every 6 months we change the filter in the fridge, we use OEM products as we do not want to compromise the fridge, this is an excellent filter."
The units are ok.  We've had several occurrences that the filter gets over pressured which required the filter to be disconnected then reconnected to have pressurized water back again.
Was what I needed however was somewhat expensive
Item as described and delivered promptly. This is the first refrigerator that I owned that needs to have its water filter changed and I found the installation simple. I will buy from this seller again when It's time for a new to filter.
We needed this for our refrigerator and literally had no idea where to buy... except for Amazon. It is great quality and lasts just as long as it says it should. We always buy from here when we need a new filter!
"I needed replacement filter and didn't want 3rd party filter, only Samsung.  This was the best price and was sent quickly.  Right Product at the right price.  Would use them again."
"Fit perfect, was easy to change from the old."
Our Samsung requires this type of filter and it lasts the said amount of months before needing to replace.
I purchased this filter and it installed very ez and it works great!!!!
Turns our bad tasting water into crisp cold water.  There seems to be lots of cheap imitation out there.  Be sure to buy from Amazon to get the genuine product.
Correct water filter
Took old one out and applied this new one.  Worked perfectly.
I checked the model number on the filter that I replaced. Same model number .as the one I purchased from HHgregg for much more money..  Filter seems to be working fine so far.
"easy to install, just like the one that came from the manufacturer."
This was my second time buying this and it fits perfectly on my Samsung fridge.
Product as described. Water taste better than the Brita filter we had been using
Works exactly 6 mos every single time...so this pack will give you a year of filtered water. I'd give 5 stars if the PRICE DIDN'T JUMP up ten more dollars this year. Why?
A water filter is a water filter. Just make sure you tighten it ALL THE WAY. Even a little loose and you get a projectile missile with a trail of water behind it as it's filling up.
It works but its way overpriced.  I may try the non-Samsung filters to see how well they work.
It arrived on time and was very easy to install.
Great filter great price.
"I love the product.  It arrived quickly, intact and was as promised.  It works great!  Thanks"
Great product at a great price!  It was easy to install and much cheaper than if we had to purchase in a retail store.  We received the item promptly and it was packaged well.
This works very well .
"Installed easily and seems to remove the chlorine taste in the water just fine.  Also, my previous filter caused the water system to whine.  This filter seems to have seated/primed better because I don't have that noise anymore."
This was a great value.  I think we ended up saving $15 by getting this on Amazon versus WalMart.  It fit our fridge and I so far it is still working.  I hope it will last longer than the one that came with the fridge.
Works as promised
Very easy to install and arrived here in a timely manner from Amazon.com.  Lasts about 4 months with our dirty water. We drink a lot of  ice water and want it clean like the filter provides.
Easy to install works fine.
Product worked as advertised and was glad to get the filter at a more reasonable price than it costs locally.
"Not sure how to 'review' a Refrigerator Water Filter! All I can say is it was the correct filter to replace the one that came with my Samsung Fridge.  I will be purchasing this exact one again, when it's time to replace."
"Installation was a breeze, and didn't require turning off the water.  Only downside to this filter is that I only get around 5 months of use before the light comes on to replace."
This filter fit fine into our fridge and is working well. Glad I didn't have to hunt to find it in a local store.
Have used these  before and they do their job well
Just what in needed for my Samsung Family Hub refrigerator.
"Delivered on time, product works great and keeps our filtered water flowing."
Happy with my purchase
Works well in the Samsung fridge/freezer. I've tried cheaper off-brands and they have leaked inside the fridge. I'm sticking to the Samsung brand from now on. It arrived on time & was packaged well.
Fits and works exactly as expected. Replacing the old filter is easy as can be. The price and of course prime shipping sold me on this product.
So we finally got through two of these filters and they are great.  No issues with leaks and the water taste fine.  Great product!
"Somehow my brand new Samsung fridge came with the wrong filter. As it was a showroom model, perhaps the store switched it out. This fits perfectly and does the job."
The directions were very easy to follow to install the filter. The filter makes a enormous difference in the taste of the water. I will order the product again!!
"This filter stopped working within 2 weeks of purchase. We have returned once and replaced but it was exactly the same. If we take the filter out, water flow is strong and there is no obstruction. As other reviews mention, it could be counterfeit products. We purchased same product before and they worked fine. But recently purchased filters are different. It may be smart to buy from other stores or directly from Samsung to avoid such trouble."
"Really easy to install, done in seconds. Haven't had any issue. Water comes out and tastes like it did with the previous filter"
"It took the place of our old filter, was easy to install and works just as it should.  Also, the price was better than any other source."
I’m not sure if this product is genuine or not ! I have ordered it from Amazon in the past and also purchased it at Home Depot. This is the first time I felt that the filter was not working properly. The water does not have the just filtered flavor . Also our refrigerator stops making ice when the filter needs to be changed and then starts making ice again once the filter has been replaced. We changed the filter two weeks ago and no ice yet!! Would appreciate a response from the manufacturer/distributors.
The filter works just fine after letting the water run for a few minutes. The odd thing is that it weighs half that of the one that came with the Samsung refrigerator. I hope this is not a fake one from China.
Great product fast shipping. I would purchase this product again from this seller high quality and packed very well. A+++++
I was nervous to buy a new filter for my fridge.  I had never replaced one before and had no idea what I was doing.It was extremely simple however and my water now tastes great.  This product worked perfectly.
4stars because it doesn't last as long and the Samsung brand but worth the savings.
It fits... lol.. What else to say? If you do your research then choosing this product for your refrigerator isn't going to be a problem. Need to buy a 3 pack now.
Works great. Water tastes better with new filter so don't delay changing when the warning light comes on. Highly recommend you turn off water to fridge before installation otherwise you may be mopping it up under the WideOpen CoolSelect Pantry tray.
Perfect fit at a good price
"OEM filter. Had tried cheaper replacement filter that leaked.  As this is Samsung's branded filter, it fits and performs perfectly.  Worth spending the extra money."
Easy to prep and install. Water tastes great. Why not 5 stars? Because there is no simple way to recycle the used cylinder.
Easy to install and does the job.
What can I say?  It's a water filter and it does its job.  I wish it wasn't so expensive but in the end it's cheaper and more environmentally friendly than buying endless bottles of water.
Don't buy the generic versions that leak and don't filter well. Instead buy the ones from the manufacturer. These ones fit easily and work well.
"Product was as advertised.However, ice began to get an odor over last couple months. Cleaned whole fridge and dumped ice thinking it was food caused but didn't solve issue. Believe water filter charcoal has quit working before the change date so was going to swap it out early.Came to order this item again and price has jumped up $27. Shop around and glad it didn't send me a new one on the subscription renewal."
"Awesome product arrived on time, it was very easy to installed.  The price is one of the lowest on the internet, this is the second one I have order online,  I will continue to order online in the future....."
"I received the filter in a reasonable time frame, unpackaged it, pulled the old one out, the new one in. Done.  Worked well, no leaks etc.. Then ran the water for a while to bleed the air from the system, no problems."
Excellent product.  Easy to install and good tasting water.
Product condition as described. Great quality. Very satisfied customer.
"Man, These are a pricey filter."
Great price.
"i hope its just a break in period. maybe the water has to run through the filter before the red light turns off. i dont know. this one was definitely cheaper than here locally and from the reviews ive read its not any better than what people are purchasing at lowes, etc. who knows maybe its just samsung filter as a whole."
"Great tasting clear, water from this water filter. I had no issues with any leaks so far as other people have described but will update if I run into any issues."
Excellent filter...we have been using this filter for a few years now and we are very happy with it. Thanks
expensive
"Biggest waste of money EVER!!  If your water tastes find out of the tap then forget the filter in the fridge.  Just keep resetting the light, it's on a timer not if the filter is dirty.  My water tests at about 40PPM dissolved solids in the water.  I changed the filter and suddenly my water tasted nasty, I checked it and the reading was 212PPM.  I was like WTF it suppose to take stuff out not put gunk in.  I put the old filter back in, the one that is used up.  In three glasses it was back to 50PPM and tasting fine again.  If you want to find out what clean pure water tastes like; try Zero Water.  I used it at my last house, I don't need it at this new house.  That is where I got the tester and it has always been true for me."
"was looking for replacement cartridge above for samsung refrig. this works perfectly. once you take the old cartridge out, can't put it back in. the new one fits perfectly. not sure how the system know which is old or new but it does. works great"
Too many off brand filters don’t work. These do.
"As stated in the topic- developed odd taste and basically quit filtering after 2 months.  I also had to keep reseating it because it was drawing air and vapor locking the water dispenser.I purchased a replacement (identical Samsung brand and model number) from a local box store.  Comparing the two, there were obvious label differences in the font type and  arrangement of the words.  I also noticed that the box store version was wrapped better.  I believe the one that I got from Amazon is counterfit, or at least factory seconds, but cannot prove."
"We hadn't had our refrigerator 6 months yet, but it was making a terrible grinding, or jackhammer noise. When I called Samsung, they said to replace the water filter, and if it didn't stop to call them back. It did the trick."
A must have for my refrigerator and a much better price here than the local stores.
"Ordering online makes my life easier, now I don't have to go to the department store every few months.  Plus when you buy a package of certain quantity you save!  It's the original requiered by the manufacturer of the fridge so it works great too."
"This Is Te Original OEM Product for the samsung refrigerators and is a lot cheaper than the other stores, and it wash shipped fast."
Filter cost twice as much at local fix-it store than this Amazon purchase; works swell in Samsung refrigerator.
Made for the Samsung refrigerator
This makes crappy city water taste great.  Installation is a snap!  As other reviewers have stated you don't even have to turn your water supply off.  Very nice.  Another plus is that these filters seem to last around 9 months with our household usage.
just the right amount of packing; perfect for my refrigerator.  Simple and quick delivery.
Doesn’t last long at all
"I really like the taste of water with this filter.  It's real simple to install and lasts about six months.  I've had other brands of refrgerator water filters, but this one ry give a natural pure taste to the water."
"These filters are pretty good, and they last a lot longer than the recommended replacement schedule says before they start to fail. Just a pain to install/change, but that's more a complaint about the fridge itself."
"Great filter, easy to install."
It fits the fridge and works well.  Will buy again!
works as expected
It is exactly what fits my fridge
"Fits my samsung refrigerator model well, didn't have to make a run to the store to get it.  Price is reasonable.  win/win situation"
Multi pack value!Difficulty putting in the new filter but works just fine.
"Less expensive than buying in a big box store, but still pricey for a water filter IMO.  Will buy again however when a seller is back in the $35-36 range.Just have to make sure it fits your refrigerator model number, remove old filter, install new one, and run a gallon through it to get air out."
My Samsung refrigerator requires it for clean ice.  I'm pleased with it's performance.  The price and delivery experienced from Amazon is what keeps me purchasing it from them.
This filter was defective. Amazon won't let me return because it's over 30 days. I order my filters when the light turns purple. Once it turns red (about 3-4 weeks later) I change it. Apparently try this won't work for Amazon orders because it put me outside of my 30 days for returning. Have never had this problem until ordering from this seller. After installation and flush the water tastes bad like plastic and for 3 weeks we tried to flush it more and the water and ice continued to taste horrible. We went to lowes and bought another filter and it immediately tasted normal. Do not buy from this seller Samsung customer support told me that there are people online selling bad filters. Beware!
These work just fine with our Samsung refrigerator.  Easy to purchase and have delivered...no searching the local stores.  Installation was simple and these fit perfectly.
It is ok for my Samsung flex zone refrigerator
This product is a good value and easier to get online than the store that I purchased my refrigerator at.
The filter is very netely packaged
This is a name brand water filter and is very good. The water filters that are generic absolutely do not work in my refrigerator.
"We have no choice but to buy these filters, so might as well purchase at a discount and Amazon has the best pricing.  Not a scientist so have to assume that they work."
"Samsung DA29-00020B Refrigerator Water Filter, 1-Pack met my requirements with ease!  I have been using the Samsung filters for a few years and Amazon is a good, relliable source for this product.  Keep up the good work both Samsung and Amazon.com!"
"Not all that I would expect. I have water marks on the stainless front of my fridge. I would have thought with a water filter that it wouldn't happen.... sad, just sad. It fit into the fridge no problems. Quick and easy to use. Just hate those water lines."
"Algo demorado el envío, pero llego perfecto."
Tried the other brands... didn't work. This filter cost a lot more but at least it works
I always order this filter for our water dispenser but the only downside is the high price for a filter that I have to change every 6 mos. even we have a RO filter attached to it to prevent bacteria from developing.
The water tasted different than with the previous Samsung filter.  I did like the taste.  I don't know if a change has been made in filter design.
work good
"Works great, no leaks, delivered early."
Excellent product.  Don't waste your money on cheaper compatible filters.They just don't do the job.
Easy replacement. They are Original Samsung equipment filters. They work very well.
This replacement water filter is great and easy to install.
Great filtered water
Do your self a favor and ONLY use Samsung OEM filters in your $2000 french door fridge. No need to cut corners on cheaper copy products. You save some money on them but can cause issues later. Get the REAL DEAL!
If you are able to test the water you will see it adds impurities to your water. I found more impurities with the filtered water than from my tap!
Fit perfectly and went in like ease!  Water taste great!
clean taste and good flow from the water dispenser on the fridge.  some filters can be duds and not allow adequate water flow.  happy with product.
It’s a great product replacement.
"Not much to review.  Easy installation, good quality filter. Sign up for the auto delivery and you'll never forget to change the filter."
"Arrived promptly, exactly as ordered.  Perfect!  Thanks!"
"I bought an aftermarket version for our fridge and it leaked as it had a really bad o-ring seal. This OEM version is really well made and fits the fridge with no leaks, and the water taste better than the  aftermarket one."
Exact item for our Samsung fridge.  Water is crystal clear & odor free.
"FITS my SAMSUNG was little worried bout smaller Hole on top,,, and reviews that it Leeked,, But mine working Just FINE."
Great
What a difference a filter makes in the taste of the tap water. No after taste anymore. Just remember to turn off the water valve behind the fridge before putting in the filter. I had a huge puddle to clean up.
Does the job
Works just like the original..
"Initial installation had a small leak, removed and reinstalled worked fine. Probably something l may have done wrong. Will buy again for sure."
Fits and does what it is supposed to.
Saved me almost 50% of what it cost in my local stores.  I am so glad I searched Amazon before I purchased another high priced filter from the local stores.  Arrived quicker than expected which was a plus to the purchase.
Works great
The filter worked great but for the price it seems a little high. There are after market filter that a a great deal cheaper but there are mixed reviews on them so you don't really know where to trust them are not. For the quality of the filter i would have give it at least 4 stars but the price should be lower. I think if they would lower the price and sell in a pack of 2-3-or 4 but make the cost of each filter a great deal less per filter it would sell a lot more of them. The filter don't remove as many chemicals as some other filters but all that are replacements are about the same.
"This is the 4th time that we've used this model filter and for some reason, now the water trickles out.  It takes about 90 seconds to fill a 16 oz glass where that would have taken maybe 15 seconds before.  We ordered a replacement, thinking that we just got a bad one and the new one is exactly the same.  For the first 30 seconds or so after installing it, it flows very well.  But then it slows down.  If I remove it and screw it in again - fast for about 30 seconds and then slow after that.  Not sure what happened but I can no longer use this filter."
"Filter works great, fit my fridge fine. The installation instructions are flat out terrible. They are written in a thousand different languages, then when you find the one you can read - they make you feel like you have to have an Engineering Degree to install the filter."
"These are counterfeit filters. Replaced my old filter with this one. The water tasted terrible, and both my boyfriend and I ended up with stomach aches after drinking. These are knockoffs, and they are not safe. Stay away! An actual Samsung water filter will have the Samsung logo on it, and the label will fade from dark blue to light blue. The correct item is pictured in the product photo. If you get a white filter without the Samsung logo on it, you received a fake. I attached a picture of both the box and the filter so you all know.I hate to think about what I drank with this in my refrigerator. Probably some terrible chemicals based on the taste. STAY AWAY FROM THESE!!!"
"Would buy this filter again. Good quality filter! Worth the money, you will be happy with this product. I will be buying it again"
This filter fits and works perfectly! It's Original product
"The filter was as expected.  I need and want clean water!  Really love being a Prime member, especially when I need something fast."
"Very easy to install. Works great just like the filter that came with our refrigerator.  I turned off the water behind the fridge, but I think I probably could have done it okay without turning off the water."
"I bought this product, and it leaked just like the offbrand product did."
These filters fit perfect!  These are so much cheaper than the OEM ones.  I never did check the level of filtration in comparison to the other OEM filter.
"Meets expectations. Better than cheepo filters that don't do particulates- especially since there is concern in our area, we can still drink safely from our fridge."
"Works as advertised. For some reason amazon requires more words than required to rate such a simple product, which is why I never leave ratings. Its a filter put it in, it doesn't leak. what else for a positive review should be said."
"Expensive, but what are you going to do?  The other filters all seem to have problems with not fitting correctly or leakage."
"I confirmed with my Samsung literature AND I called the Samsung 800 support line who also confirmed that I purchased the correct mode number water filter for my fridge...but it doesn't fit.  I can't insert the filter into my fridge.  So, now Samsung's only guidance is for me to call their 3rd party vendor which handles their parts, etc. and see if maybe there are different specs or something and someway somehow maybe I need to get a different filter than the model all of their literature states is the correct filter for my fridge.  I already know THAT is going to be a wasted call..."
As expected. Arrived on time with no issues.
"Product came as requested and in great condition.  Now I can enjoy fresh, clean water.  The trick is to turn off the water line before installing though.  Or you will go through multiple towels in clean up.  :)"
Fits my frig & works
Works very well. Our public water supply had a smell problem due to algae bloom that they could not eliminate. The Samsung refrigerator water filter eliminated the smell.
"Fake filter caused water leak in fridge. Don’t waste your money, not actual Samsung filter"
Filter water well
If you have a Samsung refrigerator you have to buy their water filter or the filter light will not go out. It will also void the warranty if you use a different brand.
Exellent product. Original - one word!
Love it
This water filter was a more reasonable price than we found it elsewhere and came quickly after it was ordered.
Exact same as the one that came from the factory. Same markings & labels. Not an OEM replica. Works perfect.
My Samsung 3-door refrigerator
Had 7 months on my new refrigerator and needed to change the filter.  I got the part number off the old one and ordered it here.  I bought the genuine Samsung filter because I wanted the carbon block filter to remove impurities.  The water with the new filter had a plastic taste that just wouldn't go away.  I waited too long and couldn't return it.  There are lots of aftermarket filters that are cheaper.  But I wanted the original one.  I found one on line from a different vendor.  Ordered it in and didn't have a problem with the plastic. taste.
"If you have a Samsung fridge you must purchase this filter. I tried the cheaper filter and my water line began ""hammering"" making loud sounds. Once i replaced the filter with the Samsung all the problems stopped."
"I bought an off-brand replacement filter and some time later, it began to leak.  I replace it with this Genuine Samsung filter and no more leaks.  That's what I get for trying to save a couple of bucks."
decided on the Name-Brand;  the comments left by other 'shoppers' mentioned this model eliminated more bacteria and odors...I have to take there word on it.  Happy with the product. Blissful ignorance as to how valid the claims were.
Bought it for my daughter's fridge. Haven't had any complaints from her. So it MUST be good.She is very good in telling me when something is wrong.
"Whether you like it or not, once you buy the fridge that uses this filter, you have to keep buying it.  The thing is that i found the price a lot more tolerable on Amazon than at Sears."
Very good and convenient.
Easy install.  No leaks like the cheaper knock off brands.
original filters do the job... copy cats do not...
Good
I could not find the filter at this price elsewhere. The package arrived in time and good condition. I have installed the filter and it has been working well since the installation.
Haven't been able to find any difference between these filters and the ones you can buy in a store.... and it's half the price!I also received a refund for customs charges today...What more could you ask for?
Does what it is supposed to do.  Reasonable price.
Came in on time great product
"After buying a six pack of generic filters and returning them, I bit the bullet and bought this. Using the zero water meter where they say replace when it the water level gets to six, out of the box having bled five gallons through the filter this filter measures 200.  If you want ice you are forced to periodically this filter. My next step will be adding an inline filter on the feeder hose. I inherited this refrigerator in a recent move and they dropped $2600 on it. I would have thought that designing a real filtering system would have been done."
Much needed item for Samsung refrigerator.  They have you by the short hairs when shopping at a Lowes-type store and you get 2 filters at Lowes for the same price I paid for 3 online.  This is the only way to go!
Knowing the big box stores prices are at $10 dollars higher for same product makes this an easy choice.  It performs and last just as long too.
Better then using a off brand
"Not much to say about this item.  It works and is very easy to install.  Fortunately, the Samsung refrigerator has a digital readout on the front that tells you when the filter needs changing - not very often."
"First off they fit my frig correctly, no leaks and fresh tasting water, I would buy again."
"Filter came as advertised and within the 10 days in spite of the weather. Although it isn't necessary to close the water valve to replace water filter, I recommend it, if possible, for easier removal and insertion."
"Usually I don't have a problem with these filters. I recently replaced one (according to the instructions) and soon after I had what appeared to be some sort of sediment floating in the water. I contacted Samsung, and they recommended flushing another three gallons of water through it. It cleared up for a little bit, then the sediment resumed. I had purchased two, so I replaced the filter. I haven't had problems since. Samsung concluded that the filter was defective, but didn't want to exchange it since I purchased it through Amazon. Amazon says ""This item is no longer eligible for return,"" and I couldn't find a link to contact customer service. So for now, I'm stuck with a defective filter."
"removed old, installed new, that easy/"
This replacement filter works well and was easy to use.
Exact replacement of the original Samsung filter.
Warning! Do not buy generic filters! The only filters that have not leaked on our fridge are the Samsung filters! Got these fast!
Very quick delivery.  Pricing is amazing
Costs more than others but goes in and out with no problem and never leak if put in as directed.
It is a shame it has to be so expensive for such short service.  I am sure the manufacture controls the cost.  It does what is to do.
These filters are great! I was so happy to actually find the Samsung brand filters for my refrigerator at such a good price. I checked the store where I bought my refrigerator & they were twice as expensive. So very good value.
Good
Works great!
Works great. I have been buying this thru Amazon for the past 3 years and never had a problem. The price is less than what I would pay at big box stores.
Purification of water
Very easy to install.
"price is high, but only fully certified filter available. All the 3rd party ones are not certified to filter as much"
Easy to install.  Works just fine.
"Easy to replace, but very expensive."
We buy these whenever our refrigerator needs a new filter.
"Price has gone up nearly 50% since the last one I bought only a year ago. Samsung does it because they know you have no other choice if you wish to continue using your water dispenser.  I'll go back to my culligan faucet, where filters cost half as much!"
"makes the water taste so much better! and this is the only place to get it from!!! I wish there was a reminder to order every x time (day, month, n of month, etc.)"
Buying two or more saves money in the long run.
Just what I needed
The only place I can find them  at a good price
This filter is exactly what my Samsung fridge needed and it is the best price I could find anywhere. I have to replace every 6 months and my water always tastes fresh
"I was buying 1 from Lowes when the change filter light came on,I decided to look on amazon and bam found the 3 pack.The price is like buy 2 get 1 free from what i was paying and came superfast."
"This was so easy to replace in my Samsung refrigerator. Also, we have had it for about 4 months and my refrigerator still says it is good. I would spend the money on the real deal vs getting a knock off that may only last you a month."
"I got this filter about two weeks ago and mounted  it on my Samsung 2-door refrigerator. The filter replacement indicator is still on. I have no idea whether the filter is good or bad. My wife think the filter is bad. I am confused as to whether the filter is in good condition or not. This is my second time replacing the the filter on this refrigerator. The first time it worked like a charm, this time around, not so much."
"Easy installation, just wish these didn't cost so much."
We have bought 2 filters since buying our Samsung refrigerator. It eliminates the chlorine flavor we get from the tap water. We are drinking more water since it has a better taste. We will be buying more filters in the future.
"I bought these filters for our Samsung refrigerator.  I wanted to write this review to point out that this is the actual Samsung filter created by Samsung for Samsung products.  This is not a ""substitute"" or ""compatible"" filter."
"Perfect fit with no leaks.  Appears to work as well as the filters sold in the Home Depot or Lowes, at a reduced cost."
fit right & worked
Use for my Samsung refrigerator.
I liked the product and is used for my refrigerator
Fine
Was just fine fits no leaks!!!
"After not much use but beyond the return window, the filter started getting though less and less water in my Samsung fridge. By now, the water flow is unbelievably weak. A quick test of removing the filter showed normal water flow so the problem points clearly to the filter."
"Easy to buy, cannot find them in the store all the time"
One thing that is worth buying the REAL thing.  Why trust your water filtration to a dupe?
You can taste the difference between tap water and water filtered by this filter. I am glad that I can get a better deal here on Amazon than at Best Buy.
Worked perfectly on our Samsung refrigerator.  Half the cost of what Sears wanted for the same filter.  No leaks and the product appears to be a genuine Samsung filter.
"It did it,s job, nothing special about it, because you need to replace the filter whether you like it or not. It was very easy to buy from Amazon and the price is good."
Fit perfectly and was easy to install.
This product works great and fit perfectly.  Installing the filter was a breeze and and we were up and running in minutes. Just follow the instructions about running he water for 10 to 15 minutes to clean the filter and you are golden.
We bought the cheaper off brand first and the water tasted terrible.
The Samsung filter delivers fresh waterLove it
As expected
"Caused a leak on my Samsung RF4289HARS fridge: shortly after the installing the filter on a 6 month old fridge, water was leaking from the flex tray area. Samsung repair tech came out and determined it was from the filter. Was advised to stick with filters from big name brick and mortar stores (Best Buy, Sears, Home Depot, etc. etc.). Tech recounted several service calls from other customers who would develop leaks or poor water flow after using filters bought on amazon. He mentioned there was a possibility that these filters were not genuine and basically re-branded with a Samsung sticker. Seems like a lot of recent reviews about leaking.  Perhaps a bad batch?Although the filter is more expensive at brick and mortars ($39-49), I paid the same price that was here on amazon with a PM to BB."
"Worked fine and fit perfectly in our Samsung.  I would rather pay more for ""Samsung"" than try a replacement product."
"Easy install. Fast delivery. Fits my Samsung Model RS25J500DSR, DA97-08006A-1 refrigerator."
It was great
"So far, all is good. No issues."
Exactly as advertised
Nothing
"Have been using this for years with my Samsung Refrigerator.  Even though we have under sink filters, I use this also.  The water tastes great!!"
"Purchasing water filters (Samsung DA29-00020B from Amazon is convenient, quick and priced below the regular retail outlets pricing. The filter has always provided excellent filtration for the water dispensed from the refrigerator, no taste from impurities or chemicals. They and Amazon are highly recommended.MW"
Do not waste your money on this filter. It is supposed to be a brand name OEM filter but mine just stopped working right after the thirty day return period. It fit well but in less than a month it went from working to barely dispensing any water at all. That never happens if I buy these filters from Lowes or Home Depot. in that case they last close to 6 months. My house also has a whole home carbon filtration system in the garage so there is no way a filter should get clogged in a month. Would never buy these again when they cost the same at Lowes and you know they are authentic.
"Not sure what to really say about a fridge filter and I'm not as funny as the Tuscan Whole Milk. However, this filter fits perfectly (as it should), is super easy to replace/install, and works great. Ice comes out nice and clear, not junk."
"I bought this as ""Buy Again"" option since I needed replacement filters.  Needless to say I don't know what happened because Amazon did not ship from the same vendor as before.  These filters are not the same as previously purchased the workmanship is weak and the filters are very light in weight compared to the OEM filter.  Also the picture is not the same as posted on the site (which is showing the OEM picture)  these filters label look like generic label."
Filter fit just right for my new Samsung fridge.  I did not have any issues like some of the other reviewers mentioned.  Will buy again.
"Smells good, leaves cats fur softer."
Working as expected!  Thnx
It's a refrigerator water filter.  It's the name brand product but for less than the retail stores.  It works.
After making the mistake and purchasing knockoff versions of this filter ... I'm back.  The off-brand version of these filters left a considerable chlorine taste come through.  The Samsung version makes our water taste as it is supposed to ... clean.
Overall good value
"After replacing the ""cheaper"" compatible filter I noticed that the water tastes so much better with this more expensive Samsung brand filter installed."
Excellent filter and have purchased multiple times already. Lasted about 6 months since my house drinks water throughout the day.Just need to flush out about 2 gallons or so after install.
Great price and easy installation
Filters are manufacture filters at a much more reasonable price.
Pops right in. Good price. No complaints. Recommended.
Genuine Samsung filter...it works great and by buying 2 I saved $$$$
Easy to install and a good price.
Why spend triple the price for the name brand when you can get the exact same thing minus the brand sticker for so much less?
"We bought 2 singles because they were cheaper than a 2 pack, go figure.  Fit easily into its slot.  Works like a champ."
Great price.  You can try and find a Samsung cheaper but I doubt you will.  These cost less than a Discount Filter House and you get a box and the of reminder stickers included.
"Good quality, good price, works well."
For home
Good replacement. The water quality is good. Happy with the purchase
"Easy to replace the old and put in the new one. Not sure why, though, they only last six months. A little pricey to have to replace them twice a year"
"Fit my fridge, works and was less expensive then other retailers."
Good
Easy to install. Just be sure to remove the white plastic cap from the top of it as I missed this and had to work to retrieve it from inside the filter slot on the fridge.
Fits our Samsung refrigerator at a fraction of the cost of name-brand water filter.
Tried to get one of these at the store where we bought the fridge and couldn't.  To get one from the stores that carry them and they wanted $20.00 more.  I recommend these they are just like the original.
It's OEM water filter and does what it is supposed to do.
"I have used the filters for a few years now and they work great, and the price is really good!"
Works well with no leaks.
Aesome
I put this new filter in and the water through the door barely dribbled and the ice maker wouldn't make ice. I paid $100.00 to have a service call and the factory authorized repair man said this is a bad filter. I am no longerable to return/exchange it because the return window has closed. I usually purchase a new one shortly after installing one so I have one on hand.  So much for spending the extra money for factory equipment. Very disappointed!  Now I get to buy another one.
"This is exactly what I needed.  The part number is different from what I expected though, which was confusing.  My old filter was 00020A I believe, although this filter is compatible with my fridge.  Would be nice if it keep the old part number for clarity."
It's a filter - It filters the water - It does it's job - Fit my Samsung frig as expected - No issues
"Works as expected, easy to install"
"What can one say about a water filter, except that it arrived, I inserted it into the fridge and it works fine!"
This product works great and is easy to install.
"My new Samsung French Door fridge requires these.  Great price, and delivered right to my door.  The price is so good, that I keep the next one in reserve.  No knock-offs for my Samsung!"
"So far so good. Fit perfectly, no leaks and only time will tell if it last as long as the original. Will post again when the warning light shows for replacement."
"The product works fine, but I'm giving it one star because of the ridiculous pricing.  I paid $32.96 for this filter in 2015.  What justified the hike to $49?  This product is made in Mexico, so it's not as though you can feel good about paying more to support American workers.  I have to wonder if it had anything to do with the Flint, MI scare...preying on fear for corporate greed?  I found a 3rd-party brand filter on Amazon for a third of the price, and it seems to be working fine.  Samsung makes good products, but the $49 price of this filter is absurd."
"Standard fridge filter for Samsung, easy to install, arrived on time, no issues or problem whatsoever. Perfect so far, make sure to get rid of the first glass that comes out though just to make sure the filter is clean and no residue from the old filter"
"We bought a two pack of these filters for our fridge. A few days later our ice maker started making a weird noise. We were nervous because we thought there was something wrong with the fridge ($$$). We called a technician who charged $75 for the visit only to tell us that the problem was our filter and needed to be replaced. So we did, changing the filter out for the other one of the two we bought. The fridge started making the noise AGAIN. We called the Tech AGAIN. AGAIN another service fee. And the diagnosis was the same: bad filter. So we were 0 for 2 on these. I am buying filters from a local store from now on to save myself the headache going forward. Bad luck, perhaps!"
They work and are cheaper in a three pack on Amazon than in singles anywhere else.  The only difference I noticed was the water comes out a little slower than with the one that came originally with our fridge.
This filter has a much better price than the stores.  It works just as well in my Samsung side by side refrigerator.
"Filters fit just fine and we easy to install.  I was not sure if they were the correct ones, but they are and purchasing a 2 pack means I have a spare for the next time I need to replace the filter."
This is a good value.  We found that the installation instructions were over complicated.  There was no need to turn off water before putting in the filter.
"I bought this kind of filter for the fourth time for my Samsung fridge. It works just great! Fits perfectly, filters the water, no problems! Will buy again."
I am so satisfy with this purchase. It cost and quality are amazing
"I bought this water filter as it's specific to my samsung fridge, but everytime I use the samsung water filters, my fridge has no water pressure, and the entire fridge vibrates. If you experience this problem as well, I recommend using the insignia water filters from best buy"
Works every time; easy to install.  Just rated it down one because of the high cost and frequency of replacement.  I wasn't planning on this refrigerator costing me an extra $100 per year for filters.
"It was a Samsung, good prize, instant install."
Exact Filter for my Refrigerator. Easy removal of old filter and simple replacement. In my Subscribe and Save list for every 6 months.
"I put this in my samsung refrigerator.  It worked great.  By the way, I could not get to the water shut off easy so I tried it without turning off the water valve and didn't have any troubles."
This is the recommended filter from Samsung. Works great and the water tastes perfect.
"Better priced, and works excellent"
Expensive but a perfect fit
"This is the filter that is required for our fridge, and I was able to buy two filters on Amazon for about $10 more than we paid for one at Lowes."
Very easy to install and instructions are clear.
Good buy
Works as advertised
"Fast shipping, good price. We use this water filter, instead of the ""generic'."
"Have not installed it yet, but it exactly look like the old filter in the refrigerator."
Good deal! Much better pricing than buying one at a time.
I really appreciated this water filter mainly for the price.
I asked a friend to replace the filter.  It was done in about 5 minutes.  The hardest part was easing the fridge out far enough so that the water valve could be turned off.  It's been working great ever since!
"you go through this filter in about 2 months. It is cost prohibitive, so I just bought a water cooler with a built in filter. Or at worst, buy a water cooler and refill bottles at your local grocery store.Does it work? mostly, though I still have hard water stains on the dispensing nipple and down the front of the cubby for the water and ice.  The water tastes good enough though.Your fridge -unsurprisingly- will want you to change this quite frequently. It's similar to how your car will want you to change the oil after 5000 miles, even if you have 15,000 mile expensive synthetic."
"Not much to say. It fits , works and the water tastes great. This filter fits our Samsung 28 RF4287 HARS Refrigerator . Just a hint, turn off the water before changing filter . You may have less squirting of water."
Pricey but works fine.
Replacement filter.  Easy to install.
A Samsung water filter is the best for any Samsung refrigerator - substitutes don't work as well and some have left a funny taste in the water!!
a good price and it worked  the way  I wanted.
"I have had problems with this filter before and now again. I keep going back to it because I think it's going to work and the same thing happens - water runs slowly, makes crazy noises etc. I'm not convinced they're any better than the cheaper versions, in my opinion. Back to those now. So frustrating and expensive! Ugh!"
"This product is needed twice a year and is a genuine Samsung product.  My search yielded several ""compatible"" products that led me to be more cautious.  However this purchase was the genuine item and is working well in our fridge."
"Fit perfect will buy again, same price at Samsung but it is easier to order from Amazon"
"I prefer water from my refrigerator over bottles any day! Having said that, I don't like buying generic branded filters. This product makes me love drinking water!"
We have the deli drawer style fridge and it fit perfect. Leaked at first but I didn't have it in tight enough. But now works great.
Great price for Brand Name products especially since they go out with no real warning!
"We have a Samsung refrigerator and this is the filter it uses.  It is a good filter, but it doesn't last very long.  It only lasts about three months."
Perfect Filter.  Very Good Price.  And of course Amazon is king of fast shipping.This filter for our newish Samsung refrig lasted 6 mos in a 3 person household...
working
"Work well, plugged right in and bled the system, water tastes great and looks very clear."
"The filter came fast and works just as described, can't really taste a difference between our old filter and this one though, maybe next time I'll just reset the light and continue to use the old one till the water starts tasting different."
They are as described. Genuine - same as what I buy locally. Work as described.
"I used this to replace the filter in my refrigerator. They can be kind of tricky to install and the instructions are not much help, but once you get it the items works great."
Just wasted our money on product that does not fit.
"OEM filter---that works great, can always tell difference in water quality when we use this filter."
Worked for our Samsung black side by side fridge. Don't remember what model our fridge is though. It typically lasts about 6-8 months until the warning light comes on depending on how much ice and water we are drinking.
I purchased this filter to remove the rotten egg taste from our water. It works great. Just wish it didn't cost so much.
Had to change the original filter after 6 months. I noticed the difference as the water now tastes much better. Very easy to install. A bit expensive for a filter though.
Easy to install
"Works great, tried to go the cheaper filter route but with Samsung fridge, you need to use Samsung filter. Will buy again."
I tried to save money and use an off brand filter last time and the noise my refrigerator made was terrible! I ended up ordering this one and everything works perfectly again!
good
"I purchased a 2-pack of Samsung DA29-00020B Refrigerator Water Filters in July 2011. They're easy to use and the fridge loves them. As is expected, each filter lasts half a year. I'm ordering a 3-pack this year because multi-packs are the best value."
Easy install
like the product cause it is easy to install.  just make sure water supply line is turned off before you replace the filter.
"Great convenience to buy this exact water filter delivered to my door. We keep one on hand, replacing our stock each time our Samsung ""filter light"" comes on. Seems to last adequately, as it should being name brand."
"Fits my refrigerator, filters my water (I think:-). What else can I say? Removing the old filter might be difficult with the water pressure on so you can turn off the water to the fridge and it'll go out like a charm."
These filters are the exact brand name that is for the refrigerator.  If you were to buy these at Lowes they are way more expensive.  You get the same great product and don't have to pay full price!
This is not a legit samsung product. The label on the item is blurry like it was printed in low resolution. It is not even the same size as the original filter with matching numbers.Update: 2nd picture is a legit filter I purchased at home depot. Which comes in clear packaging that also comes with this awesome device authentication strip and a serial number.  Label looks 100% authentic high quality vs. The knock off fake scam garbage you recieve.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. AMAZON SHOULD SHUT THESE SCAMMERS OUT.
ok
Works like it should! For what it's worth... get the name brand filter for your device. You won't be sorry that you spent a little more!
"Water tastes plastic or rubber, a very bad and strong flavor is entering into the water from this filter. I Did run several gallons through it to see if that would help, but it did not. Bought this one in November 2013. I have bought several of the exact same filter in the past from amazon that has been great, previous purchases:June 14 2012: Great Taste of WaterDec 15 2012: Great Taste of WaterJune 17 2013: Great Taste of WaterNov 17 2013: TERRIBLE, CAN NOT BE USED. MIGHT BE A HAZZARD???????? PLASTIC RUBBER TASTE to the WaterI did stop by Lowes and picked up a new one, and that is working perfect. so it has to be something wrong with the filter I bought.(I have a Samsung fridge w french door, model RFG298HDRS. Bought it about November 2011.)"
"I bought this water filter in March, 2014 to use when I replaced the filter in September. Every time I replace the filter, I order another one to have on the shelf ready for replacement. Yesterday however (time to change the filter), I found that the replacement I had on the shelf would not twist in far enough to lineup and seat. I even pulled the fridge forward, turned off the water and tried again to no avail. And of course my 30 day window to return this item has long since expired. I thought I was getting a good buy on this filter when compared to the price at the local appliance store, but it's worthless if I can't use it. Don't make the same mistake of buying ahead of the time you plan on using it."
Works as it should since it really is a genuine Samsung product.
Tried the knock-off filters and they didn't fit. I even wedged chopsticks around the filter to keep I from rattling.  Finally brok down and bought this one. It works great and is still cheaper than buying it from Sears.
good
This for my Samsung refrigerator perfectly
As Expected
Water taste great
"It's expensive,  but has worked great so far."
"Buying three at a time is more cost effective, and you have one on hand when it's time to replace the old one.  Amazon makes it easy!  Don't have to figure out where to go to buy one!"
"This water filter worked perfectly. It was the exact size we needed, and ordering it was so convenient. We would have had to drive over 75 miles to find a store that carried these."
more reasonable price that appliance store... like that you can purchase in double pack
"it's working so far but  as of today July 12, 2016 I woke to see filter light on after just 6 months,but they claimed it should last 12 months.This one failed."
Product worked as advertised.
This is the same product that you buy at a hardware store for a fraction of the cost.  I hope to reorder the jct time my filter light comes on.  The hardware stores are so over priced.
"It is hard to get too excited about water filters, I will say these are very easy to install and last the predicted time. Seller prompt and cost as expected. Would purchase again from this seller, delivery on date notified."
"Great product, but pretty expensive for what it is."
Great prices!
Just as described and what I needed
""
"upon installation, it did not fit . As the Amazon site product info confirmed it would fit my Samsung fridge model, RF263BEAESR AA,  when it did not, I checked the Samsung site and discovered that the counterfeits do NOT have a ridge on the inserted back end or a samsung serial #: both were absent on the filter purchased from Amazon. I guess I was hoodwinked!  I kept it to long to return it"
Tried a lower priced filter but it leaked.  Guess there isn't a substitution for the branded filter!
"I have experience with water/ice dispensers in other manufacture's refrigerators. We now have had our new Samsung french 4dr for less than a year. Original filter was slower than last frig but acceptable. As filter sensor changed color as expected, water flow slowed on the original filter. Bought this replacement OEM filter from AMAZON and installed without a problem. After start up/break in of new filter we noticed reduced water flow. Over last three months flow is slower but still dispenses without change in color of use sensor. Noticed others who bought this Samsung/3M filter have had the same problem. Samsung's website does not address the slow flow issue.Anyone have a solution?"
Hard to rate a water filter... but... the simplicity of the process was exactly what we were looking for; made it easy to find the correct product.
Second time buying one of these and have had no problems with it. You just have to follow the fridge directions and you will have no leaks or drips ! Good price and fast shipping.
Easy install.
Very easy to install works well
"Nothing to like or dislike about this, given its a water filter. However, I just looked at my last order (from Amazon) and realized that I ordered this one on Dec 11, 2012 and am now seeing the change filter indicator (purple). I don't know whether it lasting for 7 months is good or bad. Maybe others can comment."
It filters water.  What more is there to say?Easy to install.  Lasts longer than it says unless you really drink a lot of water.
good product; a bit expensive
wayyyy to expensive. but not too much choice in the matter. lasts about 6 months maybe?
"We have used these replacements for several years now and they work just like the original one.  No problems at all, easier to find online, rather than running around all over time looking for them."
Perfect fit for my Samsung fridge model even though it was not stated exactly by the description.  I checked on Samsungs site and they validated the model number.  Filter was cheaper on Amazon.
"Works like a charm!  Not cheap, but that's what we get for buying a fancy fridge."
These do exactly what you expect them to.
The replacement  filter was very easy to install provided you  follow the direction. It took less than 15 second to replace the filer; most of that time was turning the water off and on.
Fits
A little pricey but they do an excellent job.  Our city water has a terrible taste when you drink it sstraight from the faucet but with these filters - nothing but excellent tasting water.  Easy to use...
Price is half what I paid in the store where I bought the fridge.
This filter is fine and the only replacement for this refrigerator.  It however is costly and only lasts 6 months even though we use the water and ice dispenser rarely.
Works excellent
Works great for our Samsung Flex refrigerator.  Super easy to install too.
I hope I’m drinking good water. Wish it was less expensive.
"I had bad experiences with leaking when using after market replacements, but have never had a problem when using the Samsung replacement."
fit perfectly and much cheaper then at HD.
good filters. the price is high but less expensive than buying bottled water
"REFRIGERATOR FILTER, FAST DELIVERY, PRICE"
"Easy to install,  no leaks. Fits perfectly"
Makes you feel great just knowing our water's filtered and definitely has our water and ice cubes tasting better! Price is fair! Will buy indefinitely!
I have a Samsung refrigerator and needed to purchase a new filter.  The Samsung website sells the same filter for much more.  Nice to be able to purchase the same filter for less at Amazon.
Works perfect
"Happy to buy from Amazon for my  Samsung Refrigerator Water Filter Da-2900020B at lower price than from other places/ filter works great, not expensive.Hope in future we have more deals and saving more! Good Job!"
Works great takes out all bad taste
fine product
Exactly what I needed and arrived promptly and securely
This was an easy to install water filter for our frig.  It wasn't too scary to change and was surprisingly a lot easier than I thought.  I will be ordering again when time to change.
"I believe these filters are cheap OEM.  Will not order filters from Amazon again.  I had a Whirpool Refrigerator prior to this Samsung and used to buy filters from Amazon and had the problems with the water coming out extremely slow.  I thought it was my water line.  So when I purchased the Samsung Refrigerator, I had a separate water line installed just for the refrigerator.  The filter that came with the refrigerator worked fine.  After six months of use, the filter light came on so I ordered a filter from Amazon.  After two months the water was barely coming out.  So I thought maybe this is a fluke, so I ordered another filter from Amazon and the same exact thing happened.  I am a regular Amazon shopper, but will not order filters from Amazon again."
Correct water filter replacement for our Samsung RS261MDBP refrigerator. Pulling out the old one was hard because there is nothing to grip onto so I had to use a pliers. Putting in the new one was easy.
"The water from my Samsung fridge tasted great until I installed this filter. I followed the directions, flushed a lot of water through, etc., but the water tastes horrible. I have to flush three glasses of water through it every time I want a glass of water. When I do that, it tastes great. Figuring this was just a bad filter, I ordered a second one. The same thing happened. I don't know what's going on, but these filters are worse than drinking water without a filter."
"Yay, much better! Cheaper substitute leaked. Got the real Samsung part and now no leaks!"
Quality Samsung product.
I found this to be the best price in town on these filters and I searched a lot.  Didn't have the same terrible tase as the one in my old fridge did for several days after I changed it.
"The products works as expected and the quality was awesome.  If you are looking for a top of the line water filer, look no further."
Not much to say except it is perfect fit and works as expected.
Expense product but it is the only one that works.
I was very pleased with this product and the service.
water taste better with this one as opposed to the Walmart one
"Theres a weird reside on the top of the filter. Feels gel-like, potentially some sort of lubrication?"
It works.
Works well and fit perfectly for my Samsung refridgerator
"why do these cost $20 more then last year ? filter works fine even though the spout looks a little differtn , some people are having leaking problems , we have not encountered that yet . but we need a new one and they were only $30 last year now there $50 , what gives ? any reliable generics out there ?"
Replaced our water filter in our fridge and it was simple and easy.
"Have to admit the only reason I ordered the Samsung, as it's more expensive than the knock-offs, is because I didn't want to take a chance on voiding my warranty w/my refrigerator. Of course, it works fine !!"
Value for money
fits perfectly
Easy install
"Perfectly good filter replacement for our Samsung fridge.I'm surprised how pricey these are, but... oh well.Three of these filters should hold us for awhile."
"This item was exactly what I needed, was easy to install, and came in a timely manner.  Would buy again."
Great Product
Works just as it should. Was easy to install (I did not have to turn off the water to install in my refrigerator). Cheaper price than the filters at Lowe's where I bought my frig.
"10/2017 I always buy this refrig filter from Amazon, perfect fit every time ✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️"
"Delivered on time.  Easy to install, my wife & daughter installed the new filter upon arrival because I was out of town.  No change in water flow from refrigerator dispenser, unlike some off brand replacements I've experienced with other refrigerators."
It was very easy to install and very intuitive.  Water taste is very nice and acceptabe. CONS: I think this filter is a little bit expensive for offering only 6 months use.
"It's a water filter, what else needs to be said. It fit fine, did not leak, makes the water taste filtered. I wish it wasn't so expensive, but cheaper here than anywhere else. Water flow remained to same as before."
Bought a Samsung refridgerator and wasn't sure about the water filtration  feature. Boy was I wrong. This is the best water on earth.  These filters are awesome.  Fast delivery. Great price.  Thanks!
Best way to buy filters if you can because it saves a little bit of money and I have an extra filter when I need it because the filters don't last as long as indicated when I purchased refrigerator.
True Samsung branded water filters. Provides a great tasting clean drinking water.
"This water filter is branded for the refrigerator. It was easy to install and fit perfectly. After spending lots of $$ on a great refrigerator, I can't see opting for a generic variety that doesn't work as well."
Very fast deliver. It was exactly what I was expected and I needed for my fridge.
"This is a necessary filter for my refrigerator, so it doesn't matter if I like it or not. I think they could last longer. They are expensive but what are your choices? None."
Exactly what I needed just wish I didn’t cost so much
Had a cheap filter before and I had zero water pressure. Replacing with the real Samsung filter fixed that.
The item was just like the one that came in the fridge when we bought it and it works just fine.  Plus it was not as expensive as replacements from the name brand stores.
Works much better than the generic ones.
"This is one of the best prices I have seen anywhere. I order these every 6 months for the fridge, and they seem to do the job."
Good quality product. Will buy again. Fit right in the slot for filter in the fridge.
"Works great  fits our fridge and no leaking. You can definitely taste the difference between the filtered water and the tap water, tastes cleaner."
Just what I needed for my fridge! Works great!
Fit perfectly!
Excellent value! Keep a spare one available. I waited too long and my ice machine wouldn't work.
Arrived on time. Easy to install
"The Samsung filter works as designed.  easy to change out in my fridge, and has done a good job filtering our water.  They also include stickers so you know when to replace it :)"
perfect fit  expensive
The filters arrived quickly and were an exact fit.  Significant savings when buying the two-pack.
nice filter. does its job
"This filter works great, easy to install and remove.  The price tag of $30 seems high, but considering the filter is replaced twice a year, it beats buying water bottles or having a water service for sure!"
Works great and so much cheaper than retail.  The part no. was confusing at first an its listed as HAF-FIN in the manual but this is the same part.  I'd purchase this item again.
Perfect replacement for our Samsung fridge.
"This product was considerably less than if purchased retail.  I was surprised when they arrived they were actually Samsung filters.  I know the ad said they would be, but for the price, I was expecting generic."
This is my second time purchasing these filters.  They are factory equipment and work the way they are intended to in my Samsung refrigerator.
It's exactly what I was expecting and works just fine. Beware and don't buy Homedepot HDX brand to replace Samsung filter. Only use this original one.
"You have to have these if you have this 'fridge, so you may as well get multiples and get them as cheaply as possible.  Done."
This product worked perfectly in my Samsung refrigerator model #RS267TDRS/XAA.  September 2010 model.
Looks good and very easy to install.  Filter is manufactured by Samsung (I think) so its the same as original filter that came with the refrigerator.
Samsung product.  I might use an alternative next time I need a replacement.
It fits! Works like a charm
This filter works well in my Samsung refrigerator.  Price is good and I'm very happy with the filter.  Have purchased it multiple times during the past 2 years and will continue to do so.
"Best fridge filter and worth the extra money, as another reviewer said these are much better than the generic brands that do not filter as much out of the water than the manufacturer brands."
As described and a repeat buy
"This product is a knockoff and does not work. I contacted Samsung and sent photos and they confirmed it was not there product. Amazon is recommending a product that could damage your refrigerator. I tried putting my old filter, which is the correct on back in my refrigerator and now my refrigerator is leaking water with the old, correct filter in place. I am leaving it out for now and ordering the correct one from Samsung directly. Amazon needs to take this knockoff off their site."
"These are the real deal, made in Mexico."
product arrived on time in one piece fit like its supposed to with no leaks. simple on and off. why risk voiding the warranty just replace with original product and thru amazon. would highly recommend.
Easy filters to change. Nice to find the right filters.
Does the job and less expensive than local purchase
Genuine replacement easy installation.
"Best price I was able to find for this item!  However, it can be time consuming to clean the filter out by running water out of the fridge, depending on the size of your spout."
I ready many negative reviews and was kind of reluctant to buy it.  I did not even know the exact part number of the filter I needed.  But it works great and had no issues at all.
Good
Fast shipping. This filter does the job it is suppose to do. The water tastes cleaner coming out of the fridge rather than the tap.
Great! Works well and is authentic Samsung brand!
"OK, these are overpriced period, but so far the pricing on Amazon is the best I have found. They are far more at Lowes and I don't trust the knockoffs. The filter works as expected."
"This filter costs $49 and the water tastes like plastic! I seriously can't say if it is worthy buying or not. Because our Alabaster, Al city water directly from my kitchen faucet almost tastes batter, certainly doesn't taste like plastic! If you look up this review before you purchase your next fridge, then don't buy Samsung!!! Samsung doesn't provide any diagnostic tools and parts to local appliance repair guys when your fridge is out of warranty! Only guys like Sears and Best Buy Geek Squad will service your Samsung Fridge and they are darn expensive!"
"Easy to install, Works like a charm.  I would not go without changing my water filter for anything.  This filter really, really works wonderfully.  Thank you Samsung for a great product."
Good
Product is perfect. It is lots less expensive than purchasing in the stores or directly from Samsung. It's the exact same product.
Yes
Came on time and was exactly what I needed.
"Amazon price was right, and quick shipping was right.  This was original equipment from Samsung, not an after market part from a different manufacturer.  Read the reviews before purchasing after market filters just because they are cheap."
This filter did not fit correctly in my 4-door Samsung Refrigerator. Very disappointed in Amazon for selling confusing product that cannot be returned. $100+ dollars lost!! This product has same Replacement Cartridge #DA29-00020B as one that works in my refrigerator but has a different NSF Registration Number DA97-08006A-E which indicates different manufacturer. Picture shows Reg #DA97-08043ABC which matches filter that works in my refrigerator.
I ordered this Samsung replacement filter and I am happy to say it arrived early and in perfect condition.  Was the exact same filter that came in my Samsung refrigerator.  Great deal.
I am revising my previous review. The last two orders look like they are the real product. I am very happy with my purchase and will buy from Amazon in the future.
Refrigerator
Since they last 6 months I decided to stick with Samsung filters..
"I went to change my filter and realized they sent the wrong water filter. It has the correct sticker on the box, but the product is different. I have zero use for the filter since it does not fit my refrigerator and am out the money even though it was an error on their part."
I've had this on for a few months now and the flow of water into my glass is not as strong as it has been in the past with other filters that were not namebrand.  I'll go back to the ones I get 3 for less than what I paid for this one.
This item was delivered to me on June 26 and filter change light is on just short of 2 months. This is a pretty expensive filter to only last 2 months. Did I get a dud? Water tasted great... just didn’t near what the description stated.
Fit perfectly no leaks
The model is as described and works with my Samsung frig-no issues.
Was the correct filter
Samsung refrigerator filter works as described. It is definitely cheaper to purchase through Amazon versus a big box store.
Very good price for all 3 filter. Wont have to worry about purchasing filters for a while. Fast shipping!
Worth getting the Samsung brand. Water tastes great!
Great Product
"I have been buying this water filter DA29-00020B for my samsung refrigerator RS265 for a long time, however this product doesn't work on my refrigerator this time.  I compared this purchase with the old water filter i have.... this new one has a different design on the head part.  this product got 2 black rings at the head of the water filter, while the old filter has single black ring at the head part.  I tried for a long time and couldn't fit into my samsung refrigerator.  at the end, i went to home depot and bought their samsung DA29-00020B water filter and works!"
Cheaper
Like
Worked.
Our water tastes much better than the filter that came with the frig.  That we have run many gallons through it may have contributed to the better taste but either way the price is better than we found anywhere.
I had zero issues with this filter.  I read reviews that scared me about a new design but it worked great!
"The product arrived on time with no issues in placing or receiving, the item was as advertised, the item fit as advertised and worked properly upon installation with no leaks or issues."
Works great! Will buy again
This was the filter required by my refrigerator.  It arrived intact and without problem.  It lasts for 6 months and was a good price.
"Refrigerator water filter...  What's to review?  Water doesn't taste bad, but it didn't taste bad before the filter."
Great price
It does the job required of it. This Arizona water is not the best and we use the filter mostly for the freezer ice maker.
Product arrived as described.
Good price for a quality item. Not 5 stars because when first installed the filter was very noisy; it took a few days for the noise tp slowly go away.
"very good quality , have replaced old one with this product, no complaints, plan to order replacement from this place again  when needed .Delivery on time and good price. I will recommend it ."
Works!
We have been ordering these for a few years now but the current one is giving the water an odd taste.  It was placed almost 2 months ago and should not have a new filter taste as plenty of water has gone through at this point.
Just what I needed
Tasty water!
Item arrived ontime and was as described ... I can't believe I paid so much for these elsewhere!  I bought 2 for the price of one here ... :)  Yaaay!
Fit perfect
"Gotta have 'em, right? That's the reason we bought our specific refrigerator. But you don't have to pay those high store prices. Easy to replace. Last as long or longer than expected."
"Fast shipping. My filter light went off and I got this to replace it, so far it works well. I have a Samsung side by side fridge."
"Nothing more to say than it arrived in timely fashion, works as intended, and I think the price fluctuates so keep an eye on that when you want to buy a replacement for your filter."
"After reading many reviews for other, off brand filters, I decided to put down the money and get the real thing. The filter installed easily and has performed as described for over a month."
Works very well.
Great price compared to buying these in the store. Works well and the water taste good. Installation is fairly easy and after completion you just run the water until it flows properly.
Does everything as promised. OEM product so 100% compatible with the fridge.  Would give it 5 stars if it were about $10 cheaper.
It does what it's supposed to. I suppose.
Fits perfectly
Good and necessary product
"its much better to uy the genuine fitting filter, it fits first go, no issues."
"I was glad to find these for almost half price to the retail outlets (HD and Lowes). I have bought the secondary market replacements which are even cheaper, but have not had opportunity to try yet."
Easy to install/replace.  Works as expected in my Samsung cabinet depth french door fridge.  Wish ice cubes weren't cloudy though.
Our Samsung refrigerator needs the water filter changed on a regular basis. I checked the price on several websites and saved nearly $20.00 by purchasing at Amazon.
The best!!!
Almost the same has worked for my fridge.
Came on time (as usual) and price was competitive. One place where I stay away from off-brands is filtration products.
This fits our Samsung refrigerator.
"The water filter was exactly the one I needed,  The price was almost half of the store pricing.  Delivery was prompt. I was very pleased with the product."
NOT guaranteed a genuine product and a fake filter may well have BROKEN our refrigerator!!! Paid for a genuine product but am pretty convinced we've been shipped fake ones as the base design is different (missing the indented ring around it) and the filter says made in Mexico whereas the one that looks genuine (like the one on the Samsung website) says made in Korea. VERY angry right now as we could be looking at a costly replacement / repair fee.The genuine product states for use in system DA97-08006A-E the fake one says something different.
It fits!  Better price than local hardware store.
These fit my fridge.  Quick delivery.  Easy install.  Water tastes great.  Great shopping experience.
My fridge was making a strange chugging sound and spitting out air bubbles when trying to get water. After replacing the filter the problem was solved. I'm very happy with this purchase.
"It fits the earlier model DA29-type fridges too, or whatever it was that lots of people are confused about. My water doesn't taste like crap anymore. I guess that's all that really has to be said..."
These have been working great on our Samsung refrigerator. We've had no problems at all. Great product!
This was easier to buy online & fits our Samsung fridge. We have hard Florida water so don't think it makes our water taste that much better.  I have since had a reverse osmosis system hooked up & will no longer need to use filters. The fridge will dispense water without the filter in place.
"This two-pack set offers at least a 50% percent saving. This is a genuine authentic replacement part from the manufacturer! Besides, delivery was quick without any hassle. I recommend this product without any reservations."
fits my Samsung refrigerator  and works  like a charm  thanks for the great service
"I'm not sure if I drink more water than normal, but my filters usually go bad a month or so before they're supposed to.  Either way, I like how easy it is to replace."
Works perfectly fine my Samsung refrigerator
These filters had a significant improvement in water taste over the cheaper brands
"Needed this,and less expensive than Home Depot"
"No leaks, the poodles belly turns pink just before the replace filter light come on. So I know it worklng. She is a senitive little puppy."
These are the original samsung filters and are $10 cheaper than picking them up at my local store. I purchased 3 individual filters because for some reason the three packs cost more per filter.
It was the correct replacement and did not leak like the Homedepot replacement we tried that cost half as much. JG
Very Expensive!
Fit like a charmClear and good water out of the fridge
So worth buying these Samsung replacement water filters here raither then dishing out the expense of them at an aappliance store.
"Very easy to install and Amazon delivered on time for replacement.There were not many instructions on removing the first set of filtered water, just to make sure i disposed first set of filtered water."
We purchased this item as it was much cheaper than purchasing through Lowe's or Home Depot.  Item arrived very quickly and was as described.  I will order the multi pack in the future.
Great value compared to big box retailers!
"I tried ordering generic versions of this filter and had problems, but this one fit perfectly and works exactly as promised.  Well packaged and delivery was super quick."
We have purchased one of these every six months for the last two years and have not had any issues yet.  They arrive super fast and are very easy to install.
Exactly like described
"The filter that came with my Samsung refrigerator functioned great for over 6 months, I bought a second one at Lowes for far too much and it worked great for another 6 months.  I then purchased two from Amazon for a great price, but each of them slowed to a trickle (45 seconds to fill a glass of water) within a month.  I tried going back to my local box store expensive filter and it has been going strong for 4 months now.I'm not sure if Amazon got a bad batch or if they get an inferior quality product, but beware."
"Arrived on time, function as expected"
Worked as promised.
Refrigerator filter fit fine and works well.
Easy to replace and less expensive than Lowe’s!
Installation can't get any easier.  Did not have to turn off the water.  I easily removed the old and installed the new.  Minimum pressure and no leakage.  You can't go wrong here!
"This filter is in a two-pack, which is great to cut down on the cost.  Our Samsung refrigerator needs the filter changed every six months. So this works out great."
Not necessary to turn off water supply (as indicated in owner's manual) necessitating moving fridge from wall to access water valve. No leaks when filter removed with water supply still on. Very simple filter replacement process
"The only one I buy for my fridge, makes water taste so much better than the off brand versions. Fits fridge like a glove (OEM) as it should with no leaks.."
This filter produces the best tasting water I've had from a refrigerator.
This is the water filter required for my refrigerator and I love the price and the idea that I can order it.
I installed one of these filters and have 2 more on hand for when I need them. We use a lot of water and ice in our fridge so thought this was a good price.
In begging four days water came stinky and bad testing but later no issue.Water is good testing and good.
"I would leave less than one star if I could.  I used the filter (as directed by the manufacturer).  It has lasted about 3 months and is now filtering the water so slowly that It's nearly impossible to use.  I called the phone number for Samsung.  They are claiming that it's Amazons fault that THEIR filter has malfunctioned.  I spent the full price for the 'genuine' Samsung filter.  Wasted my money. It's so frustrating!!!  I will try and return, but doubt that will work!!"
It was ordered to replace one that was no longer useful and performing as required.
The filters were exactly as advertised and seem to be working great. The water taste just as it should. Buying the 3 pack saved me a lot of money so I'm very happy with this purchase.
"100% original filter, and it does exactly what it's supposed to. This is the second time I buy this product, no problems at all. Totally recommended."
Great...
Works great and no leaking.
"My water was tasting fine, but the light had been on a for a couple of months so I ordered this filter.  It installed like normal, but even rinsing through gallons of water, the water still tasted awful.  A few months later (less than six), after I'd been tolerating this nasty water, the filter light came back on.  I don't know what happened, but I wish I'd never replaced the filter. I'm not excited to drop another 50 bucks and hope it works.  My new motto is don't fix it if it ain't broke."
"samsung filter is the same as supco filter. Supco is a lot cheaper and easy to install . water tastes the same. your choice, spend more money or save. they are both great products."
I ordered the three pack because it saved over ordering individually.  These are the correct filter for the fridge and are the same as the factory filter that came with the fridge
Seems to filter water very effectively.
"I have a terrible jackhammer like noise whenever water is dispensed. I have bought this same filter many times and never had this issue. The Samsung filter is significantly (greater than double) more expensive than the other compatible filters and I expected it to fit correctly without allowing air in (which creates noise).  We takd the the filter out and put it back in almost daily to temporarily stop the sound, but it only helps for a few hours. Then, in the middle of the night we wake to the machine gun sound of water going to the ice maker.  Counterfeit filter perhaps?"
Fits in the samsung refrigerator perfectly. Works just like the name brand filter for double the price at the store. Shipped within a week and easy directions and installation. Will definitely purchase again.
This filter was exactly what I was looking for and was priced better than other sellers. It was original equipment and installation was effortless and without any leakage. Very impressed and totally satisfied.
Great price for this item
Works well with my Samsung 4 door.
These have always worked for me.  I get about 4 months use out of each one.  And I never have to worry about whether or not it will fit.
No comment
The site was very helpful in picking the right filter for my model fridge.
Received in good condition.
Sent Mineral Water instead of the Fresh Water I ordered (and what was pictured on the order). Didn't even know they had options of flavor - it's not mentioned anywhere in the description. Only discovered it after I opened up the box change the filter a 6 months later. Hope it doesn't change the water flavor. :(
I used this filter always but the price fluctuate so fast and become expensive. It can’t take 6 months only four months. The water dispense really slow after 3 months. So I replaced the filter every 4 months not 6 months as they advertised.
Authentic product. Easy to replace. Product arrived sooner than expected and was cheaper than anywhere else I looked. I do plan to buy it again!
Tried a non Samsung brand water filter but it just didn't seem to do as good a job.  went back to the original samsung brand and drinking good water now.
excellent buy
"About a month ago, I installed this into my Samsung refrigerator; thus far it is working well as expected."
Bad taste after replacement filter was installed. The water from the fridge with the original filter tasted fine.  I replaced the filter and now the water tastes bad.  I have tried three of these filters and all taste bad. I ran 5 gallons of water through the filter like Samsung recommends but taste is still bad.  We have been purchasing water bottles from the grocery store instead of drinking water from our fridge.  The water from our sink tastes fine so I know it's not the water supply.  I have also noticed a decrease in pressure with the replacement water filter.I have read that others also have this issue but haven't seen a fix yet.  Any ideas?
"Fits my fridge as expected, slowed the water flow a little but I expected that as its doing its job better than the old filter"
I had my Samsung frig for 3 years and have changed my water filter about every 6 months. Usually buy from Home Depot or Samsung directly. I drink a LOT of water. After installing this water filter purchased from Amazon the water tastes noticeably different. After keeping it for a couple of days went to Home Depot and bought a water filter to replace the amazon purchased one. Water tastes normal again. My health is not worth it to take any risks.
Works as expected. It lasts us 6 months- household of 2 adults. You can tell when it's time to change it when the light turns red and the water flow decreses.
good
Perfect replacement filter at a great price.  The local stores wanted twice as much as Amazon for the same name brand filter.  Easy to install in my refrigerator.
Perfect replacement for Samsung water filter.
This product arrived in better condition that I anticipated.  There were no defects and was very easy to install. Price was better than any store I have shopped in. Highly recommended!
"After checking prices at other places, this was the best price. My order arrived in three days and in excellent condition. The filters are a brand name and work great with my refrigerator."
"Very fast shipping. Exactly as listed.  Although I dont get the fact that if I order 2, the price more than doubles, and if I order 3, the price more than triples"
What the manufacturer recommended so that my warranty stays intact
"Excellent product. Excellent price and excllent shipping time. Will gladly reorder them again when needed, thank you. I will be sure to tell my neighbors as they have the same kind of refidgerator."
"The price was very good and it's the perfect filter.  The Samsung refrigerator requires changing the filter every 6 months, so a great price on the filter is a budget saver."
Not sure why some buyers are concern of originality of this product. My orders came on time and they seem to be original Samsung..
Good product
Don't ignore instructions to run about 3 gal of water through it before drinking. Tasted not very good until we did that.
"This was the only filter I found for my Samsung refrigerator, but was able to get a good price.  It was easy to install."
The price is a little high but it works well.  I have heard of a cheaper brand being better but I am sticking with the original for now.
Just what I needed.
"We installed this filter and immediately did not make any ice for about two weeks. Once it started making ice again, our fridge started making loud pounding noises and it still does. It makes I've only sometimes now. We are disappointed at spending $50 for a Samsung filter that didn't work."
It arrived when they said it would arrive (undamaged too) and it does what it needs to do...and that's it.Sorry I don't have a funny story to go with this.
Looked all over town to find these and they seemed way overpriced. The price was right and the shipping was very fast. When I have to order more I know where to go.
"Good replacement filter.  Installed fine, no leaks, no weird noises like some others have reported.  Water stream is the same as it was with the original filter."
Fits very well.  Quite pricey!
Works fine in my Samsung fridge.  Just wish I didn't have to buy so frequently.
You cna't beat OEM products for quality and fitment.
Easy to install. Water and ice taste great.
"This is Samsung's own filter and not an off brand, so I expected it to work perfectly and it did."
Perfect fit and will buy again when it's time
Works great with good water flow from the water dispenser. Much better water flow than previous filter.
"After reading several reviews of the ""off brand"" filters that are half the price, I decided I'd better stick with the OEM Samsung brand. I've had no problems with it. No leaks whatsoever."
This  gave  us  oeace  of  mind  knowing  that  it  was  meant  for this  refrigerator.
"The first thing I noticed was the filters where not in a box as in my previous purchase. Second thing, the printing/lettering were in lighter color. It could be a cheap imitation. When I finally got to use it, the first one won't fit snugly. It doesn't lock at all. The second one fit. We'll see in six months if the third one works. But by the looks of it, I didn't save money buying the 3-pack. Might as well by it locally."
Great filters
Easy to install and works perfectly!
Replacement filter for fridge.
Cheapest way I've found to buy genuine filters for my fridge.  They last my family 6-8 months and we love the quality of water and ice the fridge produces.
It did what it was supposed to.
"I can’t figure out the problem with these filters. First one lasted less than a month before the water was dripping out, had repair man come and check refrigerator and he said your filter is clogged. Second one also started slowing down in a matter of weeks. We have pretty good water here in NY but filters didn’t last as long as the one that came with fridge.Just bought a genuine Samsung filter less than a month after the second one was installed. The water flow is not even comparable. Stay away."
Had to return.  This item is the lower quality water filter ... a waste of money.  Also too many Amazon customers complained about receiving a knockoff instead of OEM.  Until Amazon cleans up this counterfeit mess I'll be purchasing my filters direct from SAMSUNG.  Smh.  Water is essential to life.
Sold by Amazon but still no authentication tag and no verification magnet.
"Great transaction, thanks!"
just what I wanted
Great value for a Samsung water filter.  Price is higher elsewhere.  Easy to install and it also came with instructions.  Will buy multi pack next time for sure!
Has double seal - does not leak like the cheap ones
Very good product.
"This is an excellent filter does what it says it will do.  MY WATER HAS A CLORINE TASTE TO IT, AND ITS GONE.  JUST LOVE it. Ice tastes better. coffee tastes better, and of course water tastes better.  IT WORKS."
Filter was the correct one for my unit. Price was much better than what I could get locally.When I need replacement I will order again.
Item as described
Great price and filter replacement
They was a perfect replacement for the filter that was in there and they arrived sooner than expected
The filter met my expectations and was what I needed I ordered with the hopes it would ship faster then the listing says.... But it didn't it took a month to get the new filter. if you dont mind waiting you will be happy but if you are in a hurry get it from a different seller.
"Easy to install, IF you follow the directions."
This filter is genuine Samsung and works as it should.
Wow!  Great price.  I have to replace our filters every 4-5 months.  I'm so glad I found these at Amazon.  Lowes was just too expensive.
My water is being filtered so it works fine
Fit perfectly
This filter meets the higher NSF/ANSI 53 standard the the cheaper filters don not. It fits without leaking too!
Seems to work well and easy to install.
Installed easily. Took a little time to bleed the air through but once it was purged the filter worked fine without any leaks.
"Easiest way I know to get the right filter, at the right price."
"Their pricing has been pretty good, but if they keep raising it, I might as well get it at Lowe's."
Water filtering in Samsung Flex refrigerator
Sufficient. Not sure if it is my fridge or Samsung filters but water comes out slowly even with wide open water source.
Fridge
"Something is wrong with the filter we received. Specifically, something is wrong with the seal/o-ring end. Although the water pressure is normal when the filter is removed, when the filter is installed, the water just barely dribbles out of the fridge. We never had this problem with our last filter. But from the moment we installed this new one, the water flow has been so low that the water dispenser is pretty much useless. We've tried taking it out and putting it back in dozens of times to no avail. We've concluded that this is simply a defective product. We've even had a technician come and confirm that there is nothing wrong with the fridge or the water pressure--that the problem lies with the filter."
Works much better than the generic versions. Water flow is much faster now.
Quality Product
"I think these are a little less expensive than ordering directly from Samsung.  I don't know if they're any better than the off-brand, but I feel safe with them."
Its a need and at a lower price.
"I bought 3, using the first one and didn't fit easy as it use to be. By now it's lasting as expected."
Works as designed and I think this should be on my six monthly subscription :)
"like the water that comes from the fridge, but filters expire rather quickly. run thru 100 dollars a year on filters."
fits well and works great as well.
"This is based on municipal water supply in Houston, TX.I suspect that we have high levels of silt in the water that cause the short life.When new it will dispense 1L of water in 12 seconds.After a month it takes 30 seconds.At 2 months it takes 60 seconds.Which means that to not be annoying these need to be changed monthly (more or less).At $35/each, that represents $420 per year.  Absurd.I did the math and for us it is actually cheaper to buy bottled water and just use this fridge filter for ice."
Fits my fridge as expected and I didn't have to drive across town to get it
"this filter worked great as a replacement. it took a while to get the water clean after installing it, running through maybe four or five quarts of water."
Review
Does well with our local water supply.  Adequately removes all chemical and mineral flavoring from the water.
Fits great! Water quality is great! Easy to install!
Great price
"Product as described, received in excellent condition."
"They were old and made the water have a weird taste. By the time we figured out what the problem was, it was too late to return them. We had to throw them away and get fresh ones from Best Buy. What a waste of money!!"
👍
Good filters that last
Worked great.  Good price!
"It works as expected.This product has met all expectations.  I don't think you should require a long review on a simple product, like this one."
Refrigerador water and ice maker.
This is good and fits on my Samsung refrigerator.
I purchased this set and neither fit my Samsung refrigerator even though the part number was the same as the filter I was replacing. The inner nozzle on the filters were too long. They are noticeably longer than the current old filter. I hope I have not damaged my filter housing. I have ordered replacements but will send them back if they do not fit. I will update review after they are received.
Worked no more light
hard to install--you don't have to have it in the frig...I'd pass
"Fit my model fridge, not sure if people are not installing correctly causing it to leak or not work."
"The cheapest price that I was able to find for the authentic filter.  Works and fits perfectly. Bought a bunch, so do not need to worry about running out of them."
I like buying these in bulk since I only need them every 6 months.  Product is very easy to use.  Make sure you run several gallons of water through the filter when you first install it.
Fit worked well
"I put up with this filter making loads of sound.  I thought it might fix itself.  I just went and bought a new filter at home depot.  The filter almost looks identical, with a few exceptions.  The Genuine filter has a magnet and a strip you peel off of the back to match up.  Also the first line (Capacity) is similar but not.  Buyer beware.  Paying for fake."
Does what is supposed to do.  Changing out the filter is a simple exercise with the built in knob.  I recommend you make sure it is the right refrigerator for the filter.
Replacement cartridge for the fridge. What more can I say?
Works great water is clear and  taste great
Within a month I was having problems with it not dispensing water. I continued to use it for a few more months and it would just come and go on whether it would work or not.
It fit and it works. No complaints.
Great price - fit just as expected!
Fits like a glove!
Bought the three pack for $20 more than a single here in Canada. The dealer where we bought the refrigerator was going to charge me $70 Canadian for one filter!Will always use Amazon for future purchases of this product.
replaced the original;  this was easy to install and did not leak.
Don't skimp on getting the off brand filters.  We tried the Home Depot filters and the water taste gross.  Stick with these.
"The same brand name that came with the frig.  Odd thing was at the time I got these, it was cheaper to order 2 single packs than to buy the 2-pack."
This filter makes great tasting ice cubes. (Actually they have no taste) It does the filter job so well I am afraid to buy an off brand filter.
Good water filter.  Easy to install and does what's expected...it just seems a bit too expensive.
Easy to replace. Don't forget to drain a gallon to remove any air in water line.
Works without a problem.
Works well. Convenient
"good price,best i found for genuine Samsung filter"
"This is the filter for my refrigerator and will order more in the future. They are pricey but that is the manufacture and it is the samsung brand, not aftermarket."
Easy install and water tastes good
Product meets Samsung's specifications.
gotta love it because it's the water filter for our refrigerator.
Ok
"It took about 15 seconds to swap filters, nice tasting water and ice cubes, going to have to order a 2 pack to have on hand instead of waiting and seeing the change filter light on"
Easy to use
Worked well
Worked as described
"Works -no leaks, good flow, going on two months"
"Getting mixed reviews if this is a genuine filter from Samsung. Folks, I went on Samsung official website and ordered it there. If you do the six month auto refill option, they take off $15, so you pay $34.99!"
Not sure it filters much as we have very clean sediment free water.  Still have to change the filter twice a year.
Genuine Samsung part at a great price.
"it fits and it filers my drinking water... AND its much cheaper hear on Amazon. this is my 3rd, 4 pck order from Amazon.. love my samsung drinking water:-)"
Fridge easy replacement
"Use original, off brands do not work. These work perfect and price is way below others."
"Works well, but it's too da**ed expensive for what it is. Will try an aftermarket for half the cost or less the next time I need a replacement."
Fits perfect. Easy to install with a bit of muscle.
"Direct replacement, quality fit and filtering."
I used the 1st filter and the water pressure increased significantly and overall it's a great product!
"If you don't want to mess with worrying about the correct fit and how long it will last , get the OEM product. It's only a few bucks more on Amazon, but worth it."
Just what I needed
"Came fast, intact and as pictured.  Not sure how it works though because it doesn't fit our fridge.  I didn't want to give it lower stars because of user error."
Great price for a good quality filter.  Our water in Sacramento is not very tasteful so this filter on my Samsung refrigerator makes it taste great.
Necessary but expensive
"I haven't installed it yet, but I pulled out the old one and they look exactly the same.  I love saving money."
I tested my water mineral content before I installed the new Sampson water filter the reading I was getting was 14 which is a very low mineral content. I removed the original filter which was a carbon type filter and installed the so-called  genuine Samsung filter don't be full by the writing on the box. After testing the results of this filter we had a reading of 224 mineral content is certainly drinkable. but is not the same quality of original equipment.
The water tastes a little funky at first so make sure you flush the water line when you first install with about 2 pitchers of water. Good price for a working new filter.
"This is my 2nd filter ordered 1 year apart from Amazon.  Both make the water coming out of the fridge taste like chemicals and chlorine.  Take the filter out and the water tastes fine.  I ran multiple gallons of water through both, even tried filling the filters, pulling them out from the fridge and dumping the contents down the sink (rinse and dump) about 20 times, and soaking them in water like a brita filter.  No luck getting rid of the taste.  Will not be purchasing online again."
Works great and easy to install. Water tastes nice and fresh again
I use this often and they work very well. No problems. Good product. What more can you say.  Like that I don't have to go to the store when I need them.
It's a replacement filterI ordered it because it was cheaper at Amazon than other places.All I do is mark a date on the filter before inserting it in to remember 6mts !
"I wish it was cheaper, but I tried a generic and it made a horrible shaking and noise, so I guess its worth it."
Don’t buy the cheap ones
Good
They were exactly what I wanted and the price was very reasonable.  Shipping was fast.  Could not be more pleased.
The exact same as the original one that came with the Samsung frig.
Came in time and fitted properly.  I was advised by technical support from Samsung that water need to be stopped before replacement.  I did that and had no issue.
Product as described
Fits just right and water tastes great. It is an oem product. Stick with that. I bought a different one that was not oem last time and the quality was not there.
Works perfect in our Samsung refrigerator.  Arrived packaged well and on time. Would order again.
Love the fact that it comes in a 3 pack so I dont' have to keep buying it.
Good product. Fair price. Easier than hunting in stores.
Simple to install and no leaks.
Fit our fridge perfectly fine And took the chlorine smell and taste out of the ice cubes.
"All good, but looking for better price."
"It's a water filter - it filters water.  It is Samsung, I have a Samsung refrigerator.  It fits, it works.  what else is there to say."
"Does the job, but it's so pricey!"
Seems to work well! This is my 10 one. I change it every six months. But I think price is too high!!
Works great. Arrived within 2 days
Fits and works
It works
fits well. Not sure how effective in terms of filtering.
Fit perfectly in my fridge.  No leaks and the water tastes great.
Seem to work well so far
Easy to replace and worked perfect to filter the water for our refrigerator. I have since found some third party replacement filters that also work just fine for a little cheaper price.
"I ordered this and got it within a day or so, and it just popped right in with no fuss.  I really like this easy installation water filter."
"Not sure what went wrong here, but my fridge started making a loud vibration after I installed this.  I called Samsung and they thought I got a knockoff filter.  I told them it had their name on it but they offered little in the way of a solution.  When I took the filter out, the noise stopped but no filtered water.  I bought a Samsung filter at Home Depot, installed it and it worked fine.  Did I get a knockoff filter off Amazon?  These filters are not cheap and the Change Filter indicator light started going red after a month.  I suppose I now have a 35-40/month filter expense.  Great."
The water filter came just as ordered and with prompt delivery.Just to note it took a few days of running water to get all the air out of the filter.
I had tried a replacement product but It did not work out. Water had a funny taste but not with this Samsung direct replacement. So I highly recommend this Samsung product.
what can I say... it is Genuine product!!!
Good Product but very expensive. Defiantly look for other similar items.
"original replacement filter, easy to replace."
great
Great
Each filter worked for about a week. There is no difference between these and the general ones. These are worthless I want my money back.
"Good price for these. Fast service, no problem."
"Was late getting here, instructions were hard to read and understand.  I tried to speak with someone in customer service but I was never able to get through. I finally got a neighbor to install it for me"
Works as a replacement for a Samsung fridge filter. I didn't realize how effective these filters are until I went without for a few days while waiting on this package to arrive.
Way too expensive for what it is.
Water pressure comes out much better than the generic ones
These work great and are easy to install.  The downside is the they feel kinda pricy.
"Yes, it was the product I needed and was cheaper than the dealer price"
OEM filters for great price
"Good deal,great filters! No after taste, gteat pressure thru filter. will do business again with this seller"
This fits my new samsung refrigerator. Ice and water taste great!  Amazon had what I needed for the right price.  Samsung recommends changing the filter every 6 months so price matters!
You can't really go wrong with this - it's just a filter after all.  I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't so expensive.
Perfect
"It works, but it is not as good as the last replacement filter I bought on Amazon. That one was also an OEM Samsung filter and it was just as good as the one that came in the refrigerator. This one does not filter the water as well and leaks a bit in my refrigerator. I'm going to try a filter from another company next time. It can't be any worse than this one."
"Arrived on time.  OEM Label, better price on Amazon than in retail store.  Who knows if it is better than off brand filters that fit???"
This filter is fake and has clear grease on the end that water goes threw 2x I have bought filters threw amazon from different sellers and both were counterfeit  this could have made us all sick or worse. I'm going to get my local news involved this time.
"Love this, much cheaper in store, I subscribed to subscription every 4 months. Easy to install and works like charm."
Perfect fit for my four door massive Samsung that I purchased in February. Looks and works exactly like the original - as it should.
They do the job. No complaints. Glad the 3-pack is on Prime now.
A good product for price
It was not a knock off! It came in a Samsung box and was made in Korea and worked perfectly and fit like a charm.
It was compatible with the fridge but the water didn't taste great as advertised.
we got the filter in just a few days and popped it in and we have clean water once more. Awesome product and awesome service.
Works great.
Sorry ignore previous post. I reviewed wrong item.The filter is awesome!!!
Great deal.
Easy to replace - did not even need to turn off the water to the refrigerator. Also comes with decal to remind me when it is due for another change.
The perfect fit and quality.
Good
I need this for my Samsung Fridge and got a great deal on it through Amazon.com!  It lasts for several months and comes with stickers so you know when to change it next.
"Anytime we have a chance to remove chemicals from our drinking water as well as our dogs' drinking water, I will choose the filtered water.  Water tastes better when filtered."
The refrigerator water filter above is the one that is to be used in the Samsung Refrigerator. It works perfectly!
This is the cheapest I've found on the internet for the replacement filter. Same as the original - so works perfect in my samsung fridge. They last about 3-6 months depending on your usage.
This filter works very well. The water has no  after taste and is free of any particles. I have been buying this filter for many years and it has not failed me once.
Last one lasted 2 years
"Quality is superb, just wish it cost a bit less, and/or, lasted a bit longer. Installs easily. Have no issue with quality or performance, just the value."
"Last longer than a generic I tried once. Can't beat the oem quality and the water is like its supposed to be... odorless, tasteless, clean."
"Received just as described, but decided to wait to install until I notice water flow slowing or taste changes so I don't have to replace every 6 months."
1/2 of these were worthless and just clogged up the fridge when we installed it.  The other one is only a trickle-flow after just 2 months.  Absolutely no value for your money.  I have to buy these because the off-brand ones are even worse so I still have to recommend them even w/ 2 stars.
It works perfect on my Samsung Fridge..
Easy to use. Fits petfect
These are just like the original Samsung filters and at a much lower price than any place I found.  Sears tried to tell me these were not originals but they are wrong.  Recommend them.
"received on time, leaves no weird taste on the water"
Works great. Thanks!
"fits perfect , works perfect , and costs less than other sources .  cant justify buying a multi pack .. just as I need them ."
So far soo good!!  We used one out of the three pack and no problems!
"I tried using an off-brand, and it leaked all over my fridge. Stick with the name brand!"
Fits perfectly and a great price over brick and mortar stores.
Delivered right on time and was an exact fit for our new refrigerator.  Installs easily and then ready to go.
Does what it's designed to do
Fit in my fridge and worked
Good price for quantity. help you keep on top of filter changes.
The item is as described and appears to be an exact match to the one that came with the refrigerator.
"I recently purchased this filter for out Samsung refrigerator.  It has the right product number on it and says that it is a Samsung product; however, when I put it in our fridge, the door would not close all the way.  After several attempts, I realized that the problem was indeed the filter.  I went to Best Buy where the fridge was purchased and compared the Amazon filter with the Best Buy filter and although they have the same part number, they are definitely different.  I think the Amazon one is a knock off.  My dad originally tried to shave down the half moon part on the end that was sticking out too far, but we ended up having to buy a new one from Best Buy.  What a waste of $35...I will not purchase a filter from Amazon again."
I always use the OEM Samsung filters. The off-brand filters...don't know what's in them especially if they are from China.
Works great
Works great. The two cheaper copies I got both leaked. Worth paying the extra.
Works great.
"I have purchased the Water Filter before at stores, but just one at a time as needed, the price was very high, by buying 3 at a time I really saved quite a bit of money."
Works great in filtering my refrigerator's water.  It is clear and there's no taste.
We use the Samsung water filters for our fridge.  They work well and seem to last a long time.  I wish they were cheaper!
Great water filterEasy to replaceNo problems with drippingWaiting to see how long filter will last / the one that came with the refrigerator lasted 6 months
Item is exactly as described and comes well packaged.  This works great in our refrigerator.  I have purchased item many times.
"I guess if you have to buy it, it is what it is.  Just too expensive in my opinion."
Fits perfect! No issues
"We decided to go with Samsung instead of other after market products, seemed to be a better filter.  PRICEY twice the after market items, but we preferred better quality."
"After buying two inexpensive ""comparable"" filters that leaked and made a mess, I bought a real Samsung and everything's alright again"
"It does the job.  Since the water and ice dispenser are not used frequently, I suspect that the indicator is time sensored and not use sensored.  Being use sensored would save me a lot of money as these things are expensive."
Works great and doesn't have a taste
Ok
"This filter is very easy to install. Shut off ice maker,turn old filter 1/4 turn,remove,set new filter in place,1/4 turn ani installed. Turn ice maker back on,run water through to flush and remove air and you are set!"
this is a good filter
Nothing good or bad. It fits in perfectly as expected.
The shipping was fast. I wish it had not been quite so expensive but it will last 6 months. It was easy to install.
Great item.
Worked as promised
"Works very well so far. Great product. But of course, it's also more expensive than generic brand."
Effortless installation...
Its a filter.
"Easy to buy, save some money in the process."
Works perfectly
"Best price for an expensive water filter for my refrigerator.  There are cheeper brands around, but negative reviews for them keep me paying for the name brand."
"I went for this OEM product as I saw to many poor reviews for the aftermarket filters. While still expensive for what they are, the price is way better than Samsung's list price."
"We are very picky with our water, so we opted for the best filter."
I prefer the factory filter.
"Bought this for our Samsung refrigerator.It's meant to act as the filter to place inside the refrigerator so that the water that comes out of the fridge will be filtered waterWe use the water dispenser quite often in our house. But, this filter only lasted about 10 little cups into the water started coming out black and hazy. The water was even coming out less that we thought it broke.Turns out the filter was just bad and now we use it without any filter and it's been much better than this.We tried saving money by ordering it here because they're expensive to buy in best buy or other stores"
"as it was promised on the website, the product was delivered within a couple of days. packing is good, and the quality of product is good. and the most important is that the price is reasonable."
"Works as expected, easy to install"
"These work great for my samsung fridge, I always order theses here for best price and shipping."
This is the correct filter for my new refrigerator and the price is great.  I ordered two and will go back and order more to hold in reserve.  Works great.
Works as expected as a factory replacement.  Installation was easy as well.
"Works well, water tastes great, so far so good.  I would buy it again."
Great way to have delicious tasting water without the bother of constantly carrying home case after case!  It's also quite economical compared with the cost of bottled water
"It is a water filter, so it went in the slot and did what it was supposed to do"
I like these filters expect they are so expensive to replace. I live in AZ and I'm lucky they last 6 months because of the hard water we have.
Works perfectly in our Samsung fridge.
These filters are the OEM version for our fridge. We love how easy it is to change them- no shutting off the water. No residual manufacturing taste either.
"Water filters...what more can I say about them.  They work perfectly in my fridge, as designed."
Easy to install!
They work
Works great but can get aftermarket products at better price.Just bought a 3 pack for 50 when one of these would cost 30
Works great
convenient
Easy installation. No leaking. I was concerned about the off brand products so I'm happy I went with Samsung
What can I say...It fits it does the job and it was cheaper than the big stores. It has been in my fridge for way more than three mos and it is still cleaning the water.
This is the recommended filter gor my fridge. Dont try to use a less expensive one. It wont work.
It is the genuine water filter by Samsung.  It works in our refrigerator and by ordering on line we save a few dollars.L Burrell
Best tasting water ever. Better than bottled water or at least just as good. Love it love it
exactly what we needed  I liked how the site asked for my model number to make sure it would work
"Good clean, great tasting water. The filters last me about 5 to 6 months."
easy to insert.  No water leakage.  No problems with this product.
Easy installation and works as advertised.
Good filter
We returned the Home Depot 2 pack after a cycle with the generic.  The flow was super slow.  This is the way to go for your Samsung.
Prompt delivery.  Seems to work well but hard to tell.
I'll continue to buy these
Easy to install
"This is the same water filter you pay much more for at Lowes or other.  Easy to change, I didn't even shut water off like suggested and had no problems."
The Samsung brand is required for the appliance and is very satisfactory.
Worked perfect
"Its a fridge filter.  Works just fine, though its a bit expensive for what it is.  Water comes out clear and tasteless."
"Genuine filter, expensive but works as it should."
Price is high - but it did not leak as other replacement knock-offs did
Fits as expected and keeps water tasting great.
Muy bien !!!
"The product description was Samsung Da29-00020b Refrigerator Water Filter, 1-pack. It showed a picture of two filters. When I received the order there was only one."
Perfect fit
I've seen alot of reviews here stating that they have received fakes. However that wasn't the case with my product.
"This part no longer fits.  It is apparently the correct number according to the parts department. I spent hours online and on the phone trying to get help. No one from Samsung will help. I drove to the store where I bought the refrigerator. They had no solution. At this point, I have a $2300 refrigerator that is only three years old and I can't get a replacement filter. I have spent $150 buying ""GENUINE SAMSUNG PARTS"" that don't work."
Great filter. Cheaper than others.
"This fit our fridge perfectly and was the best price I could find.  These things aren't cheap anywhere and I didn't want to use a knock-off, so I was happy to find this one."
"I read some other reviews which said the filters leaked, but mine fit perfectly."
Not sure what to like. It works as it should I suppose.
Works fine. Never buy plastic bottled water again!
"I don't know why, but since I've used these filters my refrigerator water has tasted disgusting.  I purchased this same filter a year ago and had no problems.  I bought two, and had problems with both.  I thought to myself perhaps it was just a bad batch.  I placed another order recently for one more filter and the same issue continues.  The water tastes and smells like chemicals.  I had the refrigerator serviced and the service company told me that the filters are defective.  I will be contacting Amazon about this and I'm wondering if anyone else has encountered these issues as well."
Factory original replacement and at a good price.
Perfect replacement for original equipment filter. Expensive but we think the water tastes better through this one versus a after market knockoff.
"I am stuck using this particular filter whether or not I like.  It seems adequate to the job, but more than a little pricey.  The 3-pack reduces the per-filter cost a bit.When/if I buy another refrigerator I will factor the price of the replacement filters into that decision."
Works and fits as well as the original filter
These are the original filters that come with the fridge. It is quite easy to replace one. Just follow the directions. It does take a while for the air to flush out though.
"What's to say? OEM quality, fits perfect, does the job. No worries that some copy that just sort of fits will leak or not do as good a job of filtering the water."
"We just needed to replace our old filter, this was the exact model we needed, so no issues there. The water tastes good too, you can definitely tell a difference in filtered vs unfiltered water."
"Fits right in with our Samsung fridge, as expected.  We've gone through a couple now - they work well and last a long time."
Does what it's supposed to do.
The filter is working good filtering the water in my Samsung refrigerator .  It was easy to install and the water taste great.  I recommend this product.
This product had a bad seal and caused my kitchen to be flooded. I have changed many filters over the years so I know how to properly change them. I trusted it was done correct because I followed the steps I always do when to bed and woke up with a flooded kitchen! I am very unhappy with the quality of this product. I would not recommend buying from this seller.
WAS RELEASING PARTICALES IN WATER
"After I installed this, our super-high jetstream water pressure dropped a little but returned to normal after about one week's worth of usage. Easily to replace, and as far as I can tell, filters just fine."
I always trust the factory branded filters. This was at a reasonable price for a low quantity
"We tried to use a replacement filter that wasn't Samsung and had problems with water leakage, so went back to Samsung products and this was the best price."
My refrigerator requires this filter.  This time I bought a double pack.
"The quality is great, but this is the second filter I buy from an amazon seller where the filter light on my fridge turns red within a month. It's supposed to last 6monts. I don't know if this is an issue with the amazon seller or the product itself."
"As advertised, this product is great. I saved a lot of money by purchasing this product on line. Thanks Amazon!"
Water filter
Fits well and works great
Easy to install and it works
It works well and tastes good.
"I was concerned with all the reports of counterfeit or ill-fitting filters, but the filter I received appears genuine and works great."
I ordered three different supposedly correct filters for my refrigerator. I had to return each one as they all would pop back out with a loud noise... Granted 2 were not Samsung brand and yet 'guaranteed' to be the same. The lip and edge that went into the fridge was always different than my original. Even the one manufactured by the brand 'Samsung' had the wrong lip...  I am glad I am a 'Prime' member... as each return was easy.I gave up and went to Lowe's and paid a lot more...
Tried The Home Depot replacement at less cost. Water just trickled out.
It fit and works perfect for my fridge. We go through a lot of water so it doesn't last long around here.
Fits my fridge perfectly. Doesn’t leak. Water tastes good.
I would like to recommend this product to everybody. Received ontime and in the original pack.
"The first one of these I ordered was great- it was a ""mineral water"" flavor.  But then I came back and reordered and got a ""clean water"" flavor- which didn't taste as good.  I could not find any information on the product description that says if its clean water or mineral water flavor. The filter has a label on it that says what it is...but I don't see that on the picture here either."
Very fast delivery and great price
We've been using this filter for a long time now and the fridge says it is still good.  Very happy I spent the little extra $$ for the real deal.
works good
oem part
They came well packed and in a timely manner. Its a filter. What can I say more? Its made by samsung for a samsung fridge so it should work well.
Work great!
I try to keep a few back-ups of this item. This product has served me well in the past so this order was for back-ups.
"The product is FAULTY.  It does not produce water at all.  We've removed it several times and find it full of water.  Once emptied by shaking it and returning it to the fridge, it still doesn't work.  VERY DISGUSTED!"
"Fits and works. Just bought 2 more. Very easy to replace, didn't have to read instructions the 2nd time."
"Came in without problems, wish the instructions showed where on the fridge to plug in the filter but eventually we found it."
Was very happy to see this come in as the light on my fridge was driving me nut. Even has stickers so you can mark when you put it in.
This product fit like expected into the fridge and does not leak.  the only difference is the letter on the product which is B and the original was A.  functions the same.
"I got this for the package deal that Amazon offers. My local Home depot didn't carry this filters and Lowes was way over priced. This filters work great, plug and play."
"Just received three-pack with three filters in one box.  Box looks original down to statement ""Use Authentication Tag on the product to test its authenticity.  Please refer to the Magnet Inside.""  There was no magnet and none of the filters had the genuine barcode used with magnet."
This is a pricey filter but does a good job of filtering water and lasted a good amount of time.
"I was a little worried about ordering this filter as my original filter type was DA29-00020A. But after some research has been done, I understood that this will fit with my refrigerator and it did."
As expected...kind of pricey though.
"I use one of these filters every 6 months, so buying 2 for $70+ is a bargain compared to $55 each at Lowes."
Very difficult to replace. Never had this problem before. I've read Samsung changed filter mfg.Actually had to get someone in to help me. Older ones just twist out & in with the new.We ended up draining all water from the house top down before eit would stay in!!!
Very nice
This water filter was as promised - the original samsung replacement filter.  It was easy to replace and has been workinggreat.  I would highly recommend this product.
Just what I needed.
"Finally replaced my filter and let me tell you the Samsung brand works way better then the generic brand, not a bad price either from Amazon"
"What more can be said about it, it's not like you can go out there & shop around for a bunch of different brands. It works & that's final!"
I think this is the best place to order filters from. All the local stores are much more expensive. The product description made my order easy. Packaging and shipment were great.
Exactly what I want!
"Easy to use.  Just pops right in.  I know the pricing is wonky on packs of multiples, but just check per unit cost and you should be good."
"Bought this on ""Buy Again"". Never again. Received two counterfeit filters. The boxes were legit. They just contained two different filters that tried to mimic the original Samsung product. Might have gotten away with it had they actually fit the fridge and worked. But, neither did. After reading other reviews all I can tell you is that you shooting craps with this one.  You might win. You might not. But you'll definitely pay for it  Going to attempt to return but since I had to try both filters and they are open we'll see just how forthcoming they are to be received and how much will it cost me."
These refrigerator filters do not come cheap but this was a much better deal than getting one at the big box store. Very happy with this purchase.
It is a good product.
"Prompt delivery, installed easy."
Fast shipping and always arrive New! Love ordering from here!
It is good!
Was fantastic and worked great.
Great buy compared to Lowes and other local stores. It was very easy to remove old filter and install new one.
Fits my Samsung fridge perfecly. A great price!
Great
fit exactly right
Does what it should do!
Replacement
These were purchased to replace our refrigerator water filter.  The directions are very easy to follow and use
Filter fit perfectly and the filter that arrived was authentic.
This is exactly what i needed for my samsung french door refrigerator. This price is 20 bucks cheaper than lowes and sears (where i bought the fridge from)
As advertized
This is a requirement for our Samsung refridgerator so what else can I say about it. Of course I like it because it makes our fridge work well.
I ended up valling Samsung as our filter ends with a 00020A. They said the 00020B product is what we can use and wanted to sell us expensive ones. These were perfect
Perfect fit
Great filter easy to install
We have a Samsung french door fridge that we ordered this for. worked out perfectly. The worst part was pulling out the fridge to shut the water line off.
Works well. Quick delivery. Good price.
The item was just as described and even came a couple of days earlier than what the estimated dated showed. I will buy the next filter I need from here.
Perfect
"Samsung DA-29-00020B water filter fit perfectly and was a breeze to change out. No more ""Big Box"" hardware stores for our filters. Great price, great fit. Just buy it and save yourself some time and money."
happy
Quick and easy to replace.
"OEM quality, competitivly priced, delivered quickly to your door. What's not to like ?"
works great no problems
As described. Changed out with no issues.
The filter work great. It takes a little power to remove filter.
works. expensive but then all of these are expensive.
Same as the old one. replace the old one without any leaking water.
The filter works as expected. Saving money was the original intent and that is the reason for buying two.
Good price worked well.
A good product that does what it was designed for.  There are other replacements that cost less and appear to do the job just as well.
Arrived on time and fit my refrigerator as advertised.  Couldn't ask for more.
Half the price of the same filter at Lowe's or Home depot. What else can you ask for.
This was an exact fit for my Samsung RF26J7500WW/AA side by side refrigerator. Can't be happier with it.
"As far as I can tell, this is exactly what I needed."
Works
"Be very careful - there are certain Samsung models that this filter IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH.  We have a Samsung RF263BEAEB - this filter is very similar in virtually every way to the compatible version, but just dissimilar enough that it doesn't form a tight seal and it LEAKS."
Anyone looking for water filters for the specific Samsung refrigerator should consider purchasing it from Amazon. Arrived very quickly since it is always in stock and the price is unbeatable.
Liked it
I bought the off brand and hated them. Purchased these and they are worth the extra $10 dollars
worked great You have to screw it on with a wrench or it seems impossible to get on thankyou will check again
"My Samsung refrigerator suggests we only use their brand.  This is a great price, just a few $ cheaper than in the store!"
"If you are living within a hundred miles of Erin Brokovitch country, it's best to filter your water.  It tastes better with this filter"
"I purchased this at the start of April and it is now the middle of May and my water all the sudden tastes HORRIBLE from the fridge.  I tasted all the taps in the house and they are fine.  I took the filter out and shook it up for about 5 mins and put it back in and the water was tasting good again.  After another day all the sudden the water tasted terrible again.  Rinse and repeat, there is something very wrong with this replacement filter considering the original filter worked and tasted great for almost a year!Maybe it's because this was purchased from ""Franks"" or something, but this was a waste of money."
"Fit well, no leaks"
Something was not right my ice & water tasted nasty and it started makeing nosie when water was used .. they refunded me right away for one n unsubscribed me
This was the second time I purchased this product. The package as well as the delivery time was perfect.
Great price
Fit like it should!
This is the 3rd time I order this product.
No worries with this item. Decided to go with a genuine part because of increased/higher filtering standard certification.
"Could be cheaper and last longer.  Otherwise, it does the job nicely."
Great quality. Works just fine.
As expected. Came in and was shrinked wrapped. Installed like a charm. Remember to press and hold the button for 3 seconds to reset filter light.
Workes amazingly
Perfect fit. No weird taste.
"This is specifically required by the manufacturer. Works really well. Water quality is excellent. But it only lasts 6 months (the red light turns on in 6 months, regardless of usage)."
"Fit perfectly, works great and a good price."
I only get this original brand. Easy install & doesn't have any odor.
"Installed easily and without issue, as expected from an OEM filter.No issues with packaging or getting the right product."
👍
Easy to install and well priced in volume pack.
After replacing the filter it did not reset my refrigerator check light. There were slight differences between original Samsung filter and this replacement cartridge. Water was yellowish color even after flushing the filter with 5 gallons of water never mind that inlet water is nice and clear.  Not worth putting yourself and your family at a possible health risk.
Really appreciate how quickly we received the part. It was exactly what we needed.
not much to say other than it works just like it should. I've never had any issues with this product and have been purchasing it from amazon.com for 3 years now!
Easy to change.
Don't buy the cheaper genetic filter. Stick to the brand name instead. It lasts longer.
I can't tell any difference between this product and the generic brands that sell for 1/3rd the price.
Bought a generic filter and it leaked from day one. This one does not leak at all. Works perfectly.
"These always seem to work OK, but the price seems too high."
This water filter worked perfectly.  I am on the auto reorder for this product.
"This one is $10 cheaper than going to Best Buy... Plugged right in, without having to turn off the water supply, just as several of the reviewers said."
We went back to Samsung filters after trying some other brands.  Our water hear is horrible and we need a good filter to get it tasting good.
Performs as indicated
They filter the water. The filters are expensive so we  wish they were not so expensive. I also wish they lasted longer.
"Does not hold charge  I am not upset it was a,good price. I would reorder from this seller."
satisfied with product.  checked at lowes prices and was excited with discount and my wife was happy I used this service
"They work, meeting my basic requirements.  That was all they needed to do. So they were Good. One more word to fill this message."
Worked as advertised
install it and forget it
It is the same as the one from OEM. Very easy to install and the filtered water taste very good.
works great. buy these first.
"I ordered two water filters...upon receiving them I put one in my refrigerator right away. We could not even think about drinking the water from it! It had the strongest taste of chlorine you could ever imagine! So I removed it and installed the other new one. It was just fine with no chlorine taste at all. That's one of the claims on the package side, the fact that it removes the chlorine taste. However I had already thrown the box away that it came in so I just ""ate"" it and did not return it, so I got one filter for $65.00. I can't help but wonder, ""did I get a used one?"" So think twice before thinking you're saving money by buying them through Amazon.com just go to Lowes and pay the $12.00 more."
"Good product, but WAY to expensive!"
Exact replacment
"quick service, great price, quality product.. only thing better would be a new refrigerator with each purchase."
"This is the manufacture version of the the water filter, reasonably price, exactly the same as the filter came with the fridge and very easy to install. nothing to complain."
As expected
"I received this refrigerator water filter sooner than i expected, switched out filters and it worked like a charm. No leaks no mess. Thanks Amazon!!!"
"The fit and quality are just what we hoped for. No leaks, and fairly easy to install."
Working out as expected.
It was an original replacement product so there wasn't any difficulty installing. It arrived when promised so I will purchase again when needed
Works perfect. Easy to install.
"The filters I received looked the same as the existing filter, however they leaked after insertion. One of the two filters did not have a label on it and the other one ended up being  a different model # than what was ordered, and that is why the leak occurred. Instead of model # HAF-CIN/EXP DA29-00020B, I received HAF-CIN/XME DA29-00020 A/B. I went to a local retailer and purchased the correct part and the leak was gone. I think the product itself would have been fine had I received the part # ordered."
"It's the exact filter we need, but the best was getting it in 24 hours."
Best filter for Samsung refrigerators. Definitely recommend.
"so far working great, no issues, we bought few weeks back!"
I have ordered these filters numerous times and they are great. I have never got a fake one made in Mexico like other reviews claim.
Good as anything else I have found on the market and at a much better price w/a prime membership.
Exactly what I needed to replace filter in my Samsung refrigerator.  Better price than local stores.
This fit our Samsung refrigerator perfectly and the water tastes much better since replacing the old one.
Works great!!
it test great. I like it so much.
"Plugged right in and no leaks. Expensive, but it is the manufacturers brand."
This is a replacement for a previous three pack. The original pack was deemed faulty as none of the filters lasted more than a month. The first filter has now gone bad in less than two weeks. I contacted Samsung and was informed that these are NOT GENUINE SAMSUNG filters. They told me that these are fakes that have excellent package reproductions. They told me that only their authorized distributors are selling the proper filters. Don't buy these!
Filters work as they are intended to. You do have to let the water run through them for awhile though to get the air out and water in.
The item works out great.  This item never fails me.. It came in a timely manner and the price is always decent.. I never had issues ordering this item.
Easy install. No problems. No leaks. Worth going with the authentic replacement after reading other replacement reviews.
Samsung original equipment filter quality filter.  Filtering specifications are equal or better than most aftermarket replacement filters.  Considering quality and price makes this product an excellent value.
Best filter. Water tastes great! Amazon delivered it quickly which was super convenient.
Exactly as advertised
"Arrived on time, works as promised, changing filters on the fridge is easy."
Will buy again
Quick ship and easy to install for great tasting water in the refrigerator water dispenser.
It doesnt get much better for a filter than from the manufacturer.  I replace this every six months and all appears to be well.
"They work fine and seem to last the 6 months as stated they will,  or at least very close. The price was good."
Good
Great Price
Filter is hard to find locally--plumbing contractors and retailers say Samsung won't let most of them handle their parts. The filter I received from Amazon was just what was needed and went in perfectly.
The technician arrived during the time window he said he would did a thorough check of my refrigerator.
It's a water filter at a good price.It does the job!
not really sure what to say.... its the filter my fridge uses. But I love the price here! I was paying almost twice as much for it at Sears.
We have been using these filters via subscribe and save via amazon for a long time The one we got in December had a sticky adhesive residue under the cap seal. I placed it directly into the fridge by accident and I have no idea what this slimy substance is.Unacceptable quality.
Package is damage when delivered
"It works,easy to install, intallation instructions easy,less costly than nearby retail stores had to offer in my city in florida."
Works as intended
Great
"For fresh water from the refrigerator, this is a must.  We got this product in a timely manner and were happy with it."
"Works great,it fit right i with out any problem.  Only issue is cost.  Expensive! Seems as if this is an overly costly part."
This product did not work at all.  I have bought this product before for many years and never had any problems.  But this time it would not work.  It would not allow any flow of water.  I had to go to a store to get another filter.  Same model and it worked right away.  Terrible experience with this product.  Apparently it has some type of defect.  Ended up wasting time and money.
Just the replacement filter I needed.  Works great in my Samsung refrigerator.
This product was exactly as promised and fit into my refrigerator. My water and ice are perfectly clear. I saved half the cost that it would have been in PCRichards.
The 3 pack of water filters by Samsung arrived quickly and were priced more resonably than any others on line. The quick arrival made it a great buy because I was needing it immediately. They fit perfectly.
The filter is easy to install and works perfectly.
everything was good
Received the product on time.  Was cheaper to purchase two 1-packs rather than the 2-pack.  This doesn't make sense to me.  I would recommend to a friend.
"We purchased a knock off, would not lock in. Great price, and sine the filter needs to be changed every 6 months, beats running out when it is time to change."
I have been on the phone with Samsung a few times to try and get my water flowing after installing this filter. I don’t know if it’s this filter or because i got it from amazon. I don’t know. What I know is that it doesn’t work!!!! I just took the filter out of my fridge and left it alone. Ridiculous. Guess I’m buying bottled water forever.
Worked as expected
Works great! Ty
exact replacement - no issues - seller shipped very quickly
I have being purchasing this filter for yrs from amazon the water has a nice crisp  taste to it  the  filter is replace every 6 months
It works good fit perfectly
great shipping...worked as it should
The water filter arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I needed to replace my old one. It works perfectly.
"Works good, great price."
"The item is an identical replacement part, exactly what I expected, at a much better price than I found at the store from which I purchased my refrigerator."
Perfect
Can't beat the price. these original Samsung brand filters are $40 at the big box stores.
Nice clean water. I like the 2-pack because as soon as I use the first one I order another pack and always have a filter handy.
It was easy to install.  My only comment is that it would have been helpful to have instructions with it.
"Works well with my refrigerator. Reasonable price and arrived quickly, thank you!"
This the filter recommended by the manufacturer and works well.
I bought these as replacement. It worked perfectly.
Was easy to install and was delivered ahead of schedule.  Painless
"we bought this as a replacement filter for our samsung fridge (the side-by-side RS261MD, 25.6 cubic feet), our first. it arrived quickly and installs without a problem. so far it's working fine, which is good enough for me!"
The price was excellent.
"Tried several OEM cheapies, but they leaked. Hate to pay this much for it, but it worked."
"Good quality water filter. I bought the generic ones once, definitely was not the same. This OEM filter lasted longer and the water tasted better"
Super fast shipping. Love my fridge water with these filters! Tastes better than tap and bottled water. Easy to put in also!
These filters fit my Samsung fridge and for the price well worth it
Super fast shipping and a great product and I couldnt ask for a better price. I put it in my fridge and it worked perfect easy to install
Great filters
It fits with minimal effort!
Performing well.
I purchased the original as I had read that the off brand ones leak. Well This has been leaking too and I paid 3 times the price of the off brands. I will give the off brands a try. I am not happy with this filter this time.
Think it is doing its jobGood priceI think it is crazy that each year it costs so much to maintain a refrigerator!
Great price
Performed as advertised.
"It was very easy to install, took about 30 seconds.  No after taste, no leaking no problems.  would recommend using this brand of filter again."
Great price for a dual pack.
I gave 5 stars because the Samsung Water filter is certify by NSF.
easy to use.
It fits and works like it should.  Cheaper than buying in the local home improvement stores.
"Excellent product, buy them in bulk if you can afford too."
The product works great. Saved around $10 once shipping is added. I suggest you take advantage of purchasing multiples. DI had to replace ours after 6 months of of ice and water usage.
"Genuine replacement, fits and works as perfectly...what's more to say."
Exactly what we needed and drastically cheaper that the OEM filter - and works as well also.  We have purchased twice and have been totally satisfied.
Fit our Samsung fridge perfectly and does a great job filtering out water.
"These are OEM filters so they should perform well and they do.  The 2 pack made the replacement cost more reasonable than buying them at LOWES or HOME DEPOT, etc."
what can i say? its a direct replacement for my fridge and i didn't have to runaround home depot or lowes to get it.
Filter arrived promptly and fit my Samsung refrigerator as advertised.  Very easy to install.  I recommend this filter to anyone who need one.
Needed this for my refrigerator ice maker. Best price.
I tried knock offs and they made my ice taste weird. Expensive but you can't beat the real thing.
This water filter was very easy to replace.  I thought I needed to turn off the water to the refrigerator but found out that is not necessary.
Exact same product that came with the refrigerator when I purchased it.
Works well and easy to install.
"Easy and quick to replace the water filter. Thanks for carrying this one, Amazon!"
This filter works just fine. Don't use non-Samsung replacement filters which claim to fit as they leak water into the fridge.
Was exactly what we needed and much cheaper than we could get it at Lowe's or Home Depot.
Purchased a two pack of these filters and by the end of December the second one is running very show and now needs to be replaced. This is on a public water system so really clean to begin with just a necessary part of the system if you want to use the water in the door feature of the refrigerator. So not one to write bad reviewed but this needed to be an exception.
Excellent
"Factory recommended filter is all I will use.  Works beautifully, I order the 2 pack (1 year) as each filter lasts approximately 6 months."
Works like a charm.
"Easy to install, lasted as long as expected (6 months), and produced great water quality."
Good was quick convenient
Came fast and is a genuine cartridge.  Clicked right in ad we were ready to rock again.  Reset filter alert.  Will order again when the times comes.
My water tastes great!
Works like intended.
"This filter makes my water taste just like water, which is what i like to taste when i am drinking water."
Exactly as described!
"This water filter fits perfectly in our Samsung refrigerator, and was cheaper on Amazon than it was where we purchased the fridge.  Can't beat the price savings!"
"The filter arrived in perfect condition, brand new with great packing. This is exactly the same filter as the ones you can get from retail stores except cheaper."
Excellent alternative to buying locally.  Genuine Samsung filter and it installed with no problems.  Just as described.
Worked just fine at a fraction of the one's at Lowe's.  I'll buy again
El product es excelente.
Works well - the price is stupid....  Fridge manufacturers simply rip people off for these things.
"Arrived fast, just what the fridge needed.  Easy install."
I don't particularly love it.. it is what the refrigerator needed
Works great and easy to install.
My order is exactly as listed. Came in a timely manner and was very satisfied with service and price
only that will work properly with Samsung Refig. Have tried after market. You only get a trickle of water
"100% is recommended.The product is excellent, the device is so useful that really looks like a tablet. With expansion memory can be used as a data logger, music and videos."
EXCELLENT
Works great in our Samsung fridge. Not to mention they are way cheaper than buying them from the store we purchased the fridge at.
Perfect replacement for my Samsung filter in fridge.
"Great OEM product for my fridge.  Simple and easy to use, good instructions.  Thus far meeting my expectations, would buy again."
Filter brought the hardness of my water down dramatically
good stuff
"This is my first and LAST water filter purchase from Amazon. This filter leaked for some time before I noticed it. The water pooled under the bottom drawer (I have a french door style Samsung). I ordered the 2 pack, thinking I would save a couple of bucks. This filter looks genuine, It has all the Samsung logo and numbers. Shame on you Amazon for selling fakes. Keep this up, and your reputation will take a much deserved noise dive."
"nothing much to say, Its a filter,  it works, good price, prompt delivery.This is second time I ordered them.They last about 6 months for us, depends on water usage."
Exactly what I wanted.
We use this filter for our refrigerator. It lasts about six months and is easy to change. It was packaged very well by Amazon. We will order this again.
Exactly what fits my refrigerator.  No problems.
The filters functioned excellently. I am very satisfied with the product!!
Saved a good bit compared to the local suppliers. Replaced original unit with no issues. Will use Amazon again when this one is due to be replaced.
These were exactly what I ordered and at the best price that I could find.
Great price!  What else can I say?  It's a water filter.
Great price for our newest appliance in he house.
"Very good quality and easy to install and remove. Not cheap though and lets face it, water filters are just not that exciting."
Water is soooo good.  Nice effective filter!
"Samsung water filter for your fridge. Instructions were a tad bit confusing, but once figured out, it was an easy swap. No leaks, and our filter was changed."
Exact fit!
As described!
Works as advertised.  Easy to install and water tastes good.
The filter was delivered as on time. No problems with package or product.Product exact as described.REcommended for ones that have Samsung refrigerator that matches this filter.
"Quuality Product, Easy To Install"
"Hey, before you go to Best Buy and pay way too much for an OEM replacement filter, this is exactly the same thing at a fraction of the price.  No brainer."
Water flows much better with this replacement filter!  Very easy to replace the old filer with this new one.  I would recommend it to everyone.
High qaulity !
Works as expected
this is my 2nd purchase of this filter and have had no issues. Saving @ least $10.00 when compared to Lowes or Home Depot price.
did not fit
"Bought this one just in case the Water Sentinel WSS-2 didn't work.  It did so I haven't installed this one yet, but I dont doubt that it will be okay--just pricey"
Its Samsung original and cannot be compared to competitive replacements :(Sadly price is Samsung too...
Great replacement
Good Price
"This simply is what I expected.  It is tougher than I expected to change filters, but that is a factor of the refrigerator, not the filter."
Exactly what I needed.  Came in a timely fashion.
Best pool cleaner I've ever had! Polaris is awful! So glad I found the Dolphin
This filter works well in our refrigerator. It was cheaper to get the filter delivered to our door than driving 25 miles to the nearest Lowe's.
The one I received is the same as the old one.  Hopes everyone else gets the same.
Easy to use
This thing is so dope.  You can totes filter your water and it comes out all clear.  It's cold and it even quenches your thirst.
"i purchased these with no complaint, then  i ordered aftermarket ones on a later date, never will i do that again, only buy oem."
Bought this Sept 22. Used it for 3 mths now.  So far no problem.  Last longer than the original one came with the new Samsung fridge.
Excellent OEM product.
Mine was my first replacement after the stock unit required replacement.  Moldy tasting water (to me anyway) and disappointed for the price.  I found a USA made after market filter that costs less and tastes better so don't plan on giving this OEM unit another try.
Thank you for the amazing product we received form you !We will think of you in the future when we make our next order .Thank you so much!
Works great.
OEM filter works perfect. Tried knock offs that didn't work. This filter is a perfect replacement.
"This product is the exact filter that came with our Samsung Refrigerator when first purchased.It is easy to install.  No fuss, no muss.Perfect!"
It was as expected and was the right one for our refrigerator.
"Obviously does the job, and equally obviously, double the price it should be!"
I have purchased this filter for multiple filter replacements.  The product is the OEM part from Samsung and is provided at a good price.  No complaints.
seems to be the same as what i got from sears and paid twice as much.  this was a great buy would recommend.
Very good
This is the same filter Lowes gets 44.00 and best buy charges 47.00. So there is nothing to not like as this was 24.00. New in the box fast delivery
"Can't beat the price, at Sears this is $49.99 each. Exact fit for my Samsung side by side with French doors. Looked everywhere online and this price and quality can't be beat."
Works well in my refrigerator.  I would recommend it to others. It is about half the cost of buying from the dealer.
Best price
Cheaper than the store. Works well.
Great Value
"Anyone can change this filter,easy,simple and fast. Thanks amazon."
Perfect. It's exactly what we wanted.
No issues
This worked just as intended. No problems!
Arrived promptly and was the correct produced. Installed easily and filtering water.
Installed in seconds. Perfect fit.
Just as advertised and fit perfectly.  I would recommend this product and for the price you can't go wrong.  About 2/3 the price of anything in the store.
"I purchased this filter awhile back.  When I took the old one out I compared this one to the old one that came with the fridge when I bought it brand new.  I noticed that the text on this one contained many spelling mistakes, which were not present on the one that came with my fridge.  This suggests to me that this product is not an authentic Samsung filter, but a fake.  Like other reviewers I also noticed a decrease in the flow of water after using this filter.  I will get replacement filters elsewhere next time."
"OEM filters are always best for me. My fridge is very finicky, doesn't accept generic. Knew this one would work fine."
Fit perfect
I bought one of these to replace my old filter and even though it was labeled as the same model it is not the same.  The only difference between the old and the new was the tip and the diameter of the hole that actually connects to the refrigerator.  The hole in the new filter was much too small and will not connect correctly. I had Amazon send me replacement and it was the same problem so I ended up buying one locally and haven't had an issue.Whatever source Amazon is getting these filters from seems to be mislabeling these.  I'm doubting they are really official Samsung water filters.
"This is a counterfeit! As someone stated in a previous review, the weight is astonishingly different. I just removed an authentic and this is absolutely a fake. A sticker was placed on it that’s similar but if you look carefully you can see that the gallons on the sticker are different then an original filter. Save yourself the money and go buy it at a legitimate  store"
These work great and so much cheaper than I can find them for in stores
original piece for my refrigerator
Yes it works perfectly it's what it says it was. I wanted the name brand and got it for a better price! Thank you!!
quality product from manufacturer.  These filters met the criteria of the manufacturer and protected our warranty.  The price was right as well
ok
"As expected, not much else to say."
"Counterfeit.  The box looked genuine, but the filter inside (sealed in shrink wrap) was definitely a knock off. It was missing the series number the Samsung filters have engraved into the neck. There were a few physical differences in the filter from a known genuine to this one, including the design of the neck, the design of the twist area, and the design of the body itself. The label is completely different and blurry."
It installed easily and the water tastes fine.  Not much else to say.
"This replacement is a different part number than on the original.  It works but these things are too expensive for what they do.  Plus, I think it's time they decrease the micron size rating to filter more contaminants out.  .5 micron is so yesterday with all the pollutants in the water supply these days."
Product works great in my fridge
Filters arrived quickly and well packaged.  Easily installed.  Happy Customer.
Fit our Samsung perfectly.
Works great and easy to install! Water quality from the filter is perfectly clean tasting with no tap/mineral taste.
"Works like a charm.  Factory brand.  Price is better than most.  Keeps the ice from tasting bad, and transfering that taste to drinks.  Just wish they would last longer than 6 months."
Came as described and works perfectly with our Samsung Frig. Best price I found online compared to other sites. Will be purchasing from this compant from now on for our filters.
"Very easy to install, the price is right, and same day delivery made it really usable.  Thank you."
"Great, came in the mail very quick.  My stepdad has very sensitive tastes when it comes to water, and he finally drinks it from the frig.....great"
"like it. I like it, I'll recommend to friends and relatives about this product.Very good on time delivery for more convenient."
Great
"Even when turning off the water supply, removing the old filter is not an easy job. Usually requires vise grips."
I bought this for my mother in laws. It seems to be working fine. Seems to be a good product.
"These work great, and Amazon has the best price.  Very easy installation -- it took about 20 seconds to remove the old one and install the new one."
"Ordered replacement and lo and behold, the old one is stuck in my fridge, it won't rotate to get it out. So now I am back to buying filtered water while the red ""replace filter"" light mocks me every day. Looks like I might be able to do some fridge disassembly to get it out, will have to tinker with it when I have time. Will be returning if I can't get the old one out soon."
This is the filter that goes in our refrigerator.  Don't really have a choice.  Good price here.
"Best price on this that I found. Make sure you buy 3 rather than their 3 pack, it's cheaper. Please let me know if anyone finds this cheaper"
Great value. Got 2 for a few dollars more than i have been payi v for 1.
Exactly what the description says it is. Perfect fit!
Works Great
Excellent replacement filters for my Samsung side by side refrigerator.  I would recommend it them to others.
"Samsung really made changing water filters easy.  No mess, out of the way, and just easy.  The filter always works for the entire lifetime, and we're on well water."
"Install was easy, seems to work.  Flow seems a little slower than original filter.  Amazon requires more words word word."
Did the job
Direct replacement for our fridge.  Prime shipping gets it here quick and price is good.
Product received as advertised.
Great replacement l
"I have to replace my refrigerator filter every six months, which can be quite an expense once you've upgrade your appliance.This is a great value."
Good value
Purchase this item because it was the original manufacture replacement filter at a great price. No issues at this time.
Worked as advertised.
Perfect Fit
Item fits perfectly and works great.  I've been using it for many months.
Good deal for the price. Lasts a long time as it is in use every day. Easy to change.
good . cheap
The filters are easy to install and work perfectly.  They are great ! It is good  to know my water  is safe and pure.
"2 filters at nearly half the price of retail. This is a bargain.  Quick shipping, and items were new in the package as promised."
this is what our samsung fridge uses.  works perfect.
Works great - easy to install - was in Samsung orginal package.  There is really nothing else left to say - buying two singles was cheaper than buying the double package (go figure).
"Great product especially for the price, delivery good, prompt."
Product as described!
We are very pleased with the Samsung Water Filters and will only purchase these filters.
Picked this up for my brother. It was exactly what he needed for his fridge. He said it was easy to install and had 0 problems
Have bought before and quality seems to stay consistent
"I used to purchase the 'off brand' refrigerator filters, but after using this one for my Samsung, I can definitely taste the difference and see the difference in my ice."
It was cheaper for me to buy it thru Amazon that to buy it at lowes and i need them for my refrigerator
Perfect fit and filters well.  The price seems kind of expensive which is the reason for lowering the rating by one star.
I wanted a water filter.  It's a water filter.  What's not to like?
I have used these for years they do a good job
"This is the correct water filter for my fridge as adverstised. It was extremely easy to replace, contained all the necessary parts and instructions, and was even original plastic wrapped to ensure authenticity and sanitation."
The Samsung water filter was an exact fit for my refrigerator.  It was delivered promptly as  promise.  Thanks to the USPS team.
Expensive!
Works well.  Seems to last just about 6 months before you start to notice a slow down in flow and a slight change in the taste of the water.
"Had no problems with this filter so far, water taste good. It is more expensive than other brands of filters."
This filtr worked better than any other. Thank you will order again and I don't have any more to say
Works just like it's supposed to. No issues
"Was a great value.  Did not want the hassle of going to Lowes, Home Depot and no one knowing what we need or can't find it"
They work as promised.
Fit perfectly
Far less expensive than I can get at a local store and is an exact replacement
"The best price per filter always varies on this product. Lately it has been the single packs, but I have bought the 3 packs in the past."
Works as expected and is a legitimate samsung water filter....but cheaper than buying direct from manufacturer.  Will buy again!
Great price!
I was concerned at first from some of the reviews about leaking. It fit perfect with no leaks. Will order again.
What my fridge needs.  Comes a few days after ordering
Liked as it was easy to order. Not always easy to find at your local shopping center.easy to order and is the original factory part.
seems like a good value compared from buying them from the manufacturerhas worked fine as I can tell...good value
"Páresia ser una buena compra pero en realidad no 😌 El sabor de la agua es desagradable y el filtro gotea, eh comprado filtros Samsung por 8 años y este paquete 3 es el único con el q eh tenido mal experiencia no lo recomiendo 👎"
easy install
It worked for our fridge.
"You can install it in a few seconds. I don't think I can find an alternative filter. It works fine out of the box, water tastes great."
"This replacement filter worked very well.  I wish they were not so expensive, but they are a high quality product that works as advertised.  Highly recommended."
Perfect fit!
cheaper through Amazon than buying locally and is correct filter for our refrigerator.  I do not like to try substitute knock-offs on products for this type of application.
"Easy to buy, works perfectly! But the price is ridiculous! How can a filter cost more than $20??? If that."
I am pleased with this replacement filter. I will be ordering then again when I need more!
Perfect original filters
Fit an function as expected
"Save a considerable amount of time and money by ordering two of these filters for my Samsung refrigerator. Quick and efficient, it couldn't have been easier."
Thanks! fit's like a charm water taste great makes great coffiee but not as good as the water from the mountians of Alaska for coffiee making
What can I say about a water filter for a refrigerator except it was $17 cheaper than Best Buy.
"Pricey, best bought here on Amazon !"
Easy to install.
I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT NOT BUYING THE BRAND SAMSUNG FILTER FOR MY SAMSUNG REFRIGERATOR THAT I HAVE DONE FOR THREE YEARS. IT LOOK AND WORK JUST LIKE THE SAMSUNG.
Works and fits like its supposed to.  Buy these singly as the two pack is more expensive?  not sure why.
Very easy to install.
Exactly what I was looking for half the price of big box store. You can buy 3 for the price of one
Absoutely Perfect.
Works as expected
Very good filters
"Correct product for my refrigerator, easy to install and I have an extra on hand for the next time I get the change filter message."
"So far so good, initially taste of water was weirded but got better after few gallons."
"This filter fits my Samsung French door refrigerator fine. It works as expected, the quality of water and ice is decent."
It was Exactly what I needed thank you!
fit perfectly
Fit and water tastes as clean as the the water from the original filter that came with the fridge.
OEM filter. Do not reduce the water pressure. Delivered as promised.
"Fit the refrigerator we have, was easy to install, and works as advertised."
This filter for my Samsung side by side refrigerator works perfectly. Too bad Samsung's customer service doesn't respond to questions about the ice maker.
Works great and the price on Amazon is really great compared to the big box stores.
Seems to be doing its job!  Needed to turn water supply off to install.
Works just as expected. Fits my refrigerator perfectly.
ordered before I needed it
As advertised. Does what it's supposed to do. I wish they were cheaper.
"Arrived on time, product as expected"
I works great but too expensive compare to generic brand that also work for my fridge.
Great Filter. Highly recommend.
"perfect fit, great price. No loss in flow of water like the non samsung filter's have."
"Lasts longer than Samsung's, a bit tougher to install (more force needed),but good filter."
"Worked fine.  Perfect match.They seem to be expensive everywhere.So, price was as good as anywhere I found.OEM Samsung item"
Too expensive.  I heard it does not last 6 months.  I am going to assess at 6 months. Thank you.
Item as expected  Prompt delivery.
Will do a review when I install one of these in 5 months. I just replaced one last month and they're on a 6-month cycle. Only then will I be able to tell.
product works as advertised
Good to have on hand when the fridge filter needs replacement. Glad to have found these on Amazon for a good price.
"Don't buy the off brands, they DO NOT WORK.  This one works great"
As advertised. be sure to turn off water supply to fridge and run the correct amount of water through it prior to drinking.
Lots cheaper (by 50%) than best buy.
you can get them sent every 6 months which makes it handy
Easy to replace.  Took 10 seconds.  The model I had didn't even require shutting off the water.  Good for another 6 months minimum.
Same filter that you get @ Samsung but much cheaper. No deliver charge for Prime members. Paid $55.00 + delivery @ Sear's for the 1st filter replacement.
No leaks. Water tastes good.
Works great
as expected
Everything was as it was described upon prompt arrival.
"Great product at a great price, thanks Amazon!"
A must for keeping your water filtered!
Received the filter next day. It was exactly what it was supposed to be works perfectly.
Arrived on time and works perfect
works perfectly fine
Perfect Fit...just what I needed.  Very simple and easy to replace.  They even send instructions.
I tried the aftermarket one and it was terrible.  This one is great
"Easy installation, highly effective."
Fits right in! My fridge model is: Samsung RS261MDRS. Will purchase from this seller again! Decided to purchase original filter after reading that generic filters could leak.
"Simple, easy replacement, and great price compared to in town retailers.  Will definitely purchase again."
"Necessary item for the refrigerator, and nice to buy in multiple quantities on Amazon!"
nothing special
Works all that matters
"Fit perfectly, works great!"
It's the filter I need and was priced fairly and arrived in a timely manner
"These filters worked perfectly, fit well did not leak, were identical to the original filter that came with the refrigerator."
"Great and a price also, thanks"
New filters arrived promptly & fit perfectly.  I am very pleased.
Price is good. not sure why the 3 pack costs more than 3 individuals but I can order every 6 months  or add to my Christmas list.
"Filter looks just like the original. Easy to install. Flow rate is very, very slow (had the same complaint with the original filter). Water tastes better than tap water, but not as good as water from my filter bottle with a simple carbon filter. Not impressed."
"Expensive, put at least I know it will fit and work properly"
perfect replacement.
Original Samsung product. Works as expected.
"As advertised, working great!"
Works as expected!!!!
Works as described. Great price too....why pay more at a big retail store? Always can find a great price on Amazon!
This product was recieved as expected. No complaints as of yet. Shipping was faster than expected. Very Satisfied. I would order it again once it expires. Reasonable Price
Keeps my water tasing great!
Prime is great. It saved us a trip and the install is easy.
"exactly what I want still using into no problem water filter good, very clean, no odor, I will buy next te to I recommended this product"
I've bought these a few times and they work great with my Samsung fridge.  Water tastes SO much better with these filters!!
Easy to use and install. Works well and the water tastes good.
Perfect fit no leaking.
Easy to replace and just as good as the original. Economically priced.
We are happy with the filter and price online was better than the big box stores.
Filter filters the water so it tastes like water that is filtered.
Good price and plugged right in - great tasting water again!
Good replacement for the original.
Came quick and was the perfect fit.
easy to install--does the job
Water filter  is perfect works well came in time replaced it no problems with by again. Save money rather than buying at Home Depot or Lowe's
It was affordable online.
"Works!!,  and with the recent price drop (under $30) its a deal.  Seems to be the same product at local stores, but much less expensive."
Was a piece of cake to install
Exactly what I needed.  Followed the enclosed instructions and filter works great with no leaks.
Fit exactly
"It fits, it works, and the price is reasonable. What more could one ask for?"
Works and fits perfectly.
Factory made replacement.  Nothing more to add.  The price was excellent saving me about $10 each from the retail store price.
Well packed.  Arrived on schedule.  Works well ... as advertised.
seems to be working fine in fridge serving its purpose. price is a little high but better than others.so far would recommend it to others.
"Received product on time, Bought the 2 pack, saved some money doing this,  installed product and works great no leaks and great tasting water. Thanks"
"This was a pretty good deal.  Easy to install in my fridge.  I went with Samsung over the no name brand, even though it cost a little more."
"These work perfectly, are Samsung brand which works perfectly in my Samsung refrigerator. And they are much cheaper than the big box stores."
The last one of these I got from Best Buy was defective and my water kept shutting off.  This one works like a charm.
These fit our fridge prefect and way cheaper than buying them through Samsung
Simple fridge filter works without issue. Snapped right in and we've had no problems with it. This is a genuine OEM filter as well.
I replaced the water filter in my Samsung French Door Refrigerator for the first time with this filter.  It was easy in and easy out.  Great price!
Average not the best or the worst. It's the stock manafucture product. Pricey in my opinion.
"I have bough a few of these but this one was a struggle to fit. In fact it's not really lined up,according to the lines on the filter but it works. In reality who knows how good these things are actually working!?!?!?"
last for a long time
"Expensive but no choice, only one that can fit my refrigerator.  Maybe an off brand will be available one day."
Works as expected!
"I received the product on time, do the installation and it worked perfectly. My only comment is regarding the way the product was packed, which provided little security in transferring."
it worked so well that I never gave it another thought till I saw this email
"Bought in October 2012 and the replacement light came on in November of 2013. We haven't replaced it yet, but our ice and water still tastes fresh."
Great. As described.
Fit like a glove on our Samsung fridge.
Good
Easy way to order water filter for fridge.
Da29-00020b  is the Same as Da29-00020A/B and is a real Samsung replacement.Best price around hope this helps
I cannot buy these locally. Good price
They work fine just to expensive.
The filter does exactly what it is supposed to do. Works great & the price for a 3-pack is great at Amazon!
perfect
"Just like the one we got with the Freg. Arrived the next day, WOW"
Item as described and fits my 4 door Samsung fridge! Water tastes and looks great!
Glad to have a source to replace this expensive filter
Great price on great product.  Saved a lot ordering through Amazon rather than manufacturer.  Couldn't find at all locally.
"Product performs as expected, just seems like they are all overpriced."
Fit just right.
"I love this fridge and it really helps to have a filter that is so easy to change and manage, unlike the previous fridge I had."
"Excellent product, does exactly what it claims!"
"I like it because, it is easy to remove old one and replace the new one .simple is that. no need to call professional."
It is leaking and no longer compatible with my Samsung fridge. I noticed a puddle under the fridge a couple of weeks after the install. It turns out the water is leaking slowly at the filter making a pool inside the fridge under the drawers and slowly trickling down by the freezer door.
Worked as replacement for filter for my fridge. Easy to swap and quick to get working quickly. I recommend this item.
Went looking for these at HD and Lowes...no luck.  Easy change out and back in the water business.  I will be back next year.  Thanks
Great price for 2 filters! They work great as they should
"Bought 2 filters. after installing the first one water appear at the drawer. Small leak at the drawer under the filter.I did not understand it is from the filter and every few days I clean the water.After installing the second filter the leak increased.Then I understood it is from the filter. Looks like that the two black rubber are not thick enough.This may be a manufacture failure, the filter looks original and manufacture at Korea.Too late to return."
"This is the perfect filter, and so much cheaper than buying it at the hardware store.  This is the second time I've ordered this filter."
It was relatively easy to install.
"No more bottle water for me, this is perfect !"
Good as always.
Will purchase again in 6 months👍
Easy to replace. Fit perfectly.
"great filter,fit reel nice"
"Fit perfectly, works perfectly, tastes great.  I didn't try the knock-off, the ratings were too sketchy.  This product did the job perfectly so five stars."
"Works great, I replaced a Particle III manufacture with this Particle I filter - very pleased"
"works great, no leaks. not much more I can say... its a filter. I would refer to anyone that needs one."
Did not fit
Best price for these particular  refrigerator filters
"Works great in our Samsung fridge, and lives up to its promise of about 6 months of use. Would never buy an aftermarket filter."
This cartridge works like a charm.Easy to install and remove and priced right.
Exactly what I wanted and delivered promptly for a great price. Be sure to follow Samsung's procedure when changing the filter to avoid leaks.
"This is an authentic Samsung filter that works perfectly with my Samsung 4 door fridge and delivers clear, crisp water and ice as expected. Will purchasing this going forward."
Good product
So nice to be able to get my filter for my frig on Amazon.  Fits and works perfectly. Thank you 5+
Best  price  for  this  water  filter ! !  Samsung  charges  more !!
Woeks fine.
"Much cheaper than in the big stores.  Hopefully same quality, cant tell any difference."
Perfect
This water filter was more reasonable to purchase on amazon than another site...after installing our water tastes great!  We are happy with this purchase.
"Couldn't live without it!  This time, this filter actually made the water pressure stronger than the past.  Water comes out faster!"
Since this is made for Samsung refrigerators I would expect nothing more than it working the way it should.  The price was right.
Super easy to install once you find where it is placed in the fridge. Im glad this doesnt need to be changed very often its pricey.
"None of these lasted more than two months. Water pressure from dispenser diminished to almost nothing after that time. Checked water line to fridge and hose within fridge and there were no issues. The original filter that came with the fridge lasted the full 6 months. I have since switched to a different brand and they work great. These might have the Samsung logo, but not sure they are really ""genuine"" OE parts. Beware."
Works great and good price
"Works great.  I've only used this brand so I can't compare it to others.  When replacing the expired original, the water quality went back to perfect."
"I bought this Jan 28th..installed it Feb 1st as I usually do.. no problems.  March 10th the water stopped and the ice maker stopped working.. when I took the filter out the water started working, which my trouble shooter says the filter is full. After 1 month!!! And at this price..just under $50.00! I'm very unhappy and will not buy again. I'm looking for a cheaper version..which even if it doesn't last 6 months..will still work out cheaper."
This filter doesn’t fit my new refrigerator how do I return this product
"Easy to install, and now the water dispenser works great again."
Water taste improved. .lasted me about 6 months
Great item.
Product was easy to install.  Directions were easy to follow and only took a few minutes to complete process. Recommend to order this product through Amazon.
Work good
Works perfectly with our Samsung fridge. Highly recommend!
Excellent product. As described and no leakage.
Does what it was designed to do!!
My water filter came faster than I had expected and was exactly what I needed!  I am very happy with my purchase and the price.
Unfortunately the water flow significantly decreased just after 2+ months
Worked out great.  Significantly less expensive than buying it at the store where we got the Samsung refrigerator.
This water filter is approved for my Samsung refrigerator and is hard to find locally.  This is my second order of this from Amazonand I am well pleased.
It works
This water filter has performed just fine and was about $30 cheaper than going back to the appliance store where we bought the refrigerator.
working great
Great filters that are easy to change on the refrigerator. I use replace regularly (~6 mos) and have never had any problem with my water.
"Does just what it is supposed to do.  I love that amazon ""knows"" what I ordered before so I don't have to keep track of it.  Thanks Amazon."
Replacements as ordered.  Long lasting!
This is good. I need to reorder since the filter just said it needs to be replaced.
Muy bien gracias
Don't buy imitations. Buy the best.
Great filtration but doesn't last as long as I had expected and was a little pricey as well. Does a great job at keeping the lines free of yucky tastes and smells I just wish it lasted longer.
"Have gotten this brand name in past with no issues; however, this last one started leaking from filter about a week after installation.  The female’s response... “if it’s leaking... it must be something wrong with your fridge.” Then proceeded to try and schedule a service technician.  Be aware... most customer service jobs are outsourced outside US where there is usually a huge language barrier.  Better off buying something like this locally just in case defective"
It was exactly what I had ordered and exactly what I needed.  It does a good job filtering the water on our Samsung Refrigerator.
"Sadly, Samsung will not acknowledge this as a genuine product and therefore will not help if something goes wrong. Amazon customer service was very helpful when I called about my problem."
went in smoothly and have no problems.
Simple instructions made it a snap to remove and replace.  Make sure you keep it tipped up son you don't put water all over the floor
Excellent water filter and seller.
This is exactly what it says.  Delivered on time.
"While the unit is easy to install, I tested the water for contaminates and found the water was worse than the plain tap water. How can the water be worse when going through this filter? I do not recommend."
Perfect
Fast delivery and great pricing. Filter fits perfectly. I have purchased this filter numerous times with no issues.
Works great but is expensive.
Nice filter that produces clean clear water and ice cubes. Lasts about 6 months for us on our Samsung Refrigerator. Easy installation.
These don't leak. Imitation or cheaper filters leak.
While the product arrived in a timely fashion the following would lead me to believe the product was handled by others prior to being sent to me.  (1)The carton was severly damaged ... not in shipping.  (2)  The filter was not hermetically sealed like I have always received them.  (3)  The 12 black/white month stickers for application prior to installation were missing from the package.  (4) The month of APR sticker had been already applied to the bottom of the filter ... (4) after mutiple gallons of flushing ... the water coming out is filled with white particles ... not in the clear as has been my experience.  All indications are the product is not new!
worked good
"This filter is the same as the original,same fit, easy install. Follow instructions on running the fist two/three gallons of water, and BAM! It's ready to go. Nice and Easy."
"I purchased this cartridge filter to replace the factory-supplied filter in our refrigerator from Amazon because, even with shipping charges, the filter was marginally less expensive than I could have spent at local sources including sales tax.  It was a manufacturer's direct replacement for the original unit."
goods price
Works as intended here!
This appears to be a genuine Samsung filter but when installed there is little to no water flow which causes the ice maker to freeze up. Going to return.
Found Amazon to have the best valued price for the Samsung water filter I needed for my refrigerator. Exact replacement part is always the best buy.
"this is the item for replacement. No leaks, no downtime, simple twist out, catch a little bit of water, and install new with a simple twist in."
"While it is difficult to rate a water filter, our water taste good."
"This is the only brand of filter we buy, our water is always fresh."
This product works well and doesn't leak as some of the aftermarket filters do. Spend a little more and alleviate the headaches of a possible leak.
Fits perfectly
"Only reason for the 3 star rating is the price, but I wanted to have ""real"" Samsung replacements for my refer."
"Perfect fit filter replacement for our Samsung french door fridge. The filter has an alternate code, HAF-CIN."
Fit perfectly!
"Easy to install and it works fine.  I'll buy my next one from Amazon too.  I don't, however, like the Samsung refrigerator."
This filter fits with Samsung refrigerator model rf4287hars. I was concerned since the OEM listed a different filter model number but this fits fine.  Lasts 6 months or so.
Better then the off-brand
Works as advertised
"It's better priced, promptly delivered, and works fine.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for Samsung Filter. Takes away anxiety of purity of water."
"These filters are $50.00 ea. @ Lowe's!  Needless to say I saved almost $50.00 thanks to Amazon.com.  However, don't be fooled into buying the three pack.  Order them separately, it's also cheaper!"
Pay for the right brand better quality.
My water is so clean now I can see through it
lasts 6 months. We feel safer drinking filtered water.
"Delivered quickly and the form, fit, and function was as advertised, and were 9 dollars cheaper than local home improvement store. Will use again."
"Works great, and shipped quickly."
I got two filters for just a little more than the price of one at Best Buy.  Received the product four days after placing the order!
Something is not right with these filters. We loved the quality of our water before installing this filter. Immediately after we installed at the water taste dramatically different and distasteful.
works great!
Seems okay.  Don't know how to really rate it!!  Easy to install and seemed to work very well afterwards.  Would recommend
good quality
"Sears is selling these for $52 now so with the Prime on Amazon, I save a lot of money and the multi packs are even better savings."
This is not a genuine filter. It is after market. There was a remarkable difference in taste. Also I make kefir with water: an original Samsung filter cleans the water well enough that I do not have to boil it. Using the water filtered with this filter nearly killed my kefir grains. For 20 bucks more the Samsung is well worth the additional expense. Would not buy again. In the photo Samsung is on the left.
"Great product, for our Fridge."
"Does the job,the water is filtered, I am happy"
"Other than it was a little difficult to install, it appears to work fine."
This is the second time I bought this filter. Chain stores want $50 for same product. Works great and keeps water tasting good for a long time
These filters arrived fast and fit perfectly into our Samsung Fridge with French Doors and two drawers and the price was perfect.
Good product - good deal~!
The water from the new filter tastes disgusting even after running water through it for six minutes. Now I have to find somewhere else to buy a new one from. Waste of money.
Very same product with a lower price than I bought at the store!!  Am very happy.
It works great. Fast shipment. If it's cheaper will be 5 starHope it will keep the same quality for the stock ones
This was MUCH less expensive than purchasing it through the home improvement store where we purchased the refrigerator.  It works perfectly and was easy to install.
Great deal and fast shipping!
"I purchased this filter several months ago so as to have an extra on hand. It claims to be genuine Samsung, but the design is different. The older filter has 2 o-rings whereas this has only one. This one leaks no matter how I install it. Unfortunately, one has to completely destroy the packaging in order to find out which type was purchased. It's been too long to ask for a refund. Very unhappy."
Compatibles don't work.  Ordered the real thing from Smasung and everything is perfect.
The filter worked very well and deserve a 5 star rating. It last a very long time!! I recommend this filter to alll Samsung Refridgerators.
It’s been leaking all over our refrigerator. It’s awful. What a mess. We took the filter out to see if something wrong and still leaks.
Slightly cheaper than buying at regular stores.  Easy to change and it even comes with stickers to remind you of when you last changed your filter.
"I received this filter the first week of June of this year (2016). Not more than a week later, water flow was drastically reduced. After two months, it would take a lifetime just to fill up a cup of water, and our automatic ice production came to a near halt. After buying an identical replacement via an online auction website that I won't name here, the resulting water flow was like Niagara Falls.I don't know why this one from Amazon functioned so poorly, but it's the last time I trust one from them."
We needed to replace original one that came with our Samsung fridge. Shopped around and these were very nicely priced. Really does make the water taste much better.
Works like its supposed too.
Since this is a samsung filter there is no problemwith my refrigirator however Samung should have it on a lower price
"Easy to install, works as advertised. I've ordered a couple of these, and have had no problems so far with them."
Great.
These are replacement samsung filters but I don't see a problem of decreased flow they seem as good as the originals. Would buy again.
"Does what it's supposed to do, but the diameter of the filter hole is smaller than the original, so it comes out slower."
Went in easy thanks
"Great item, would buy again"
"Excellent filter, order took a few days to arrive. Working great so far!!"
"Water tastes great after installing.  Kinda expensive but that's what our fridge requires.  Lowes ran out so we ordered, it was cheaper online."
"Best price around on ""real"" Samsung water filters.  This is the 2nd one I've ordered.  Works great."
"just what I needed at a still too high price!it fits, it works, but for what it is.... it is still too expensive."
BE AWARE This product is fake. Water filters last 6 months this one onlt lasted 2 months and it stopped working. Do not buy this. I bought this filter twise the first time it lastes for about 4 and a half months abd I though it was that we user more water and desided to order it away. this time it only lasted 3 months. Buy it at Best Buy or any retail store. BE AWARE DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.
good product.
"best price I can find, Home Depot charge almost double of the price...."
Right product at the right price. It arrived on time and as advertised. It was easy to replace the older filter with the new one.
"Product works as expected, easy to change."
"Perfect,  Order the right part number, an you shouldn't have any issues.  Seems to be of authentic samsung product.  No leaks"
"Works as designed, individually wrapped..."
"This item was rather expensive, but needed."
I did a lot of searching for this model filter and this seller has the best price. I have bought 3 times so far.
Easy to install and works as expected
The filter was a good buy!  Very competitive price and easy to install.  We will continue to buy these as needed.
I bought this filter to replace the filter in my refrigerator after the light indicated it was time to change it.  Swapping the filters out was simple.
Great price!
"Kind of mad because the filter in the picture is not the filter I received. Same as other reviews. I figured I'd take a chance as maybe the previous ones were mistakes via inventory mix ups. However, I also received a different product from what was pictured in the ad above. Now my fridge is not working as it was with the previous filter and there is a small leak. Will be asking for a refund and to send back the product."
Perfect fit and very good price. absolutely love this filter.
Very Happy with the product!!!
Much better than the less expensive generic filters. Great water taste. Will buy again! It would be nice if they has a multi pack.
The product works and fits as promised.
"I especially like the way it is easy to install, no problems.  I received it as expected and with no delay."
Installed in my refrigerator perfectly and works great. Great value no compatibility issues with my Samsung Refrigerator.
"Excellent product, always comes handy to get pack of two !"
The water filter was as described.  There was no problem installing new filter.  The Samsung filter fit perfectly.  Will order again.
Works as expected and as far as know it is safe
so happy it fits my frig
Fresh Water NOT Mineral Water.  Posted pics of purchase.Purchased 2014Nov11
"this is the filter for the refrigerator. good delivery, good price, I'm happy"
Fit well with my samsung refig and water taste great...
I setup scheduled delivery so I remember to change out that filter regularly.  My local water is pretty bad.
Great product and price
Works great!
"This filter is great for us.  While I have read complaints about duration of use, I have so far gotten full use out of them"
I purchase this product regularly for my fridge and have no complaints.
Perfect
top of the line
Good price!
No problems with this filter.
"WORKS as described, but then I found some generic filters that work just as well and are much cheaper!"
"This is a good product, which can fit various models of Samsung refrigirators. It works perfectly and I did not have any problems with it."
Worked as advertised. No issues.
expensive but i guess you need them...
Confident OEM filter
"More expensive but good water pressure.  Tried a generic brand and had to wait forever for my glass to fill.  However, it’s only lasted two and a half months. Box says six months. Not happy about that."
It works fine in my Samsung french-door refrigerator.  It arrived promptly with no issues what so ever.  What more can I say?
The 3-pack is a good value. Arrived in just a few days and installed easily. Much better deal than buying through Home Depot or Lowes.
Worked exactly like I wanted.  Cost $15 less than the same item at Lowe's Home Improvement.
EXCELLENT PRODUCT - VERY EASY TO INSTALL ITO THE REFRIGERATOR.
EASY TO INSTALL AND PRODUCES CLEAR AND TASTEFUL WATER. IF YOU HAVE A SAMSUNG REFRIGERATOR THEY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT INSTEAD OF AN ALTERNATE BRAND.
Happy with it's performance.
"Good price on a multi-pack box, received quickly."
Easy to install. Nice.
Its a water filter.  Not very exciting.  Works well but is expensive compared to non-samsung branded options.
Works like the brand name ones.
"Just what I needed!! Have bought more. We have very hard water, so I go through them like a newborn goes through diapers!!"
Installed easy but 2 leaked
"When compared the replacement filter with the original one that came with the refrigerator, I found the opening on the replacement filter to be much smaller, causing the water flow to be restricted.  Not sure the reason behind this design change.  It takes longer now to fill a water bottle or Juice jug because of the slower water flow."
Easy to replace and cheap for my Samsung 297HGDR French door fridge.Filter works great with no leaks and water tastes good.
Works very well in my Samsung refrigerator - have had no issues.
This filter was a replacement for our refrigerator/freezer water and ice on our Samsung.  It was a perfect fit and works well.
This is great filter for my Samsung fridge. Usually have to replace it every 4 month. Great value comparing to retail stores.
Works well but entirely too expensive.
"Installed into my refrigerator and now water will no dispense. I tried to put the old filter back in, and it still doesn’t work. I’m going to have to call Samsung service for a likely expensive repair."
Fits great and no leaking.  I will reorder from this supplier again.
The filters did as expected. Easy to change and prepare for usage. Cost isbetter online than in store where we purchased or refrigerator. Gotta lovethe internet.
"It's a necessary item for the refrigerator that has to be replaced about every 6 months, so thanks for creating the 3-pack."
"Works as advertised, but are quite expensive for such a simple item."
Good value for a product that I had to have
Easy to install and remove
Bought these when the third party products would not work consistently.  Haven't had a problem since!
The multipack makes changing the filter so easy. No frustration of running to the store or putting it off. The price is a good incentive as well.
Works as it should. I wish it were cheaper though.
"This is the OEM filter, it fits perfectly and the filtered water tastes good!"
No problems with fit. Works as expected
Same as original. Not sure why label is different from retail stores? But everything else is the same. Clean and tasty water.
Installs easy without a problem.
If you are looking for the OEM version of this filter use this one.  Works as it should.
perfect filter for my fridge
This sale saves me time in the future when it's time to reorder (every 6 months)Buying in advance also saves money as the price may go up.
Product works as intended and is easy to install.  I have not had any odd tastes or issues with using my fridge water while using these filters.
Worked as expected...easy to change didn't even have to turn water off to fridge!
As good as the products in store for $50.
I've been using this type of filter for almost 2 years. They work great and it makes my pipe water drinkable! without a funky taste or smell.
Reaaly taste the difference
great
These filters work well and the price is good.
t works. It fits. It's really easy to install. It lasts 6-8 months. You can't beat the price. Buy one!
it works easy to install but expensive (name brand)
"I was looking for a replacement of my current filter and wanted to spend less than retail cost. In my mind it was a great buy,"
Totally satisfied with the filter.  It was delivered quickly and I saved a few buck too.
Good
Good product
I purchased all my filters from Amazon. They used to be very good.  Now I can't taste the difference with or without.
it works just like the original one
These were the recommended products.  They work fine.
Awesome savings
This filter was so expensive at lowes so glad that when I was in lowes I had my Mobil amazon app to check the price
Thanks for your prompt delivery....working fine so far.....happy with product
"After a couple weeks the water flow is 50% or less of what it should be. Takes forever to fill glass, and I think my ice maker has making less ice because it is no getting enough water"
This is a good price for these water filters compared to what they cost at the place where I bought the refrigerator. Would buy again.
I am very pleased with this item and much cheeper from Lowes or other home building companies.  It is really easy changing filters on my refrigerator.
"These filters work great, are easy to replace and don't leak. This is the second set I have purchased and will continue their use into the future!"
Very easy ti install and fits perfectly.  Received lightning quick!
Very good!!
Great buy. Two pack is substantially cheaper than the big box stores.
Fit just the way I've  imaging it would. And not too expensive love it.
Now if they could just lower the price it would be even better.  There has to be someway for Samsung to reduce the price.
This is the filter we use for our refrigerator.  It does a good job and lasts for at least 6 months.  I am very pleased with the filter.
"Good,"
Works as advertised.  Very easy to replace on our refrigerator.  Significantly less expensive than purchasing locally.  Water tastes great.  Thumbs up!
Easy to replace and worked out fine. Should be good for 6 months.
It is not cheap but installed quickly and flawlessly.  Seemed to work well.  Will buy again when I need the replacement again.
"Great quality, easy to put in and my water taste great now."
Works like I need it to. Just cleans the water and makes it taste better. Not really anything else I'm looking for in a water filter.
exactly as described
Great value for a good product.
Much more affordable than buying in the big box stores. Keeps the water pressure high and works very well. I'll buy this from Amazon again.
Original filters work great.
Yes it works very very well.  Even better than I expected.  Will buy another one next year.  And the next year.
As advertised
Buy the OEM.  Alternative products tend to leak !  This works great.
The instructions are confusing because they crammed 5 different languages on one sheet. I am glad Amazon carries this filter because it is way cheaper at the box stores.
Works as expected
Works well .
The filter fits as expected and the water tastes fine.
"Filter was received promptly, great savings and is working great!!  I will be back again when its time to change the filter again."
Not sure if it is an authentic filter and nobody could give me an answer.  I called amazon and they referred me to samsung.  Then samsung referred me to JJ parts.  Then JJ parts referred me back to Samsung and still no clear answer on whether my filter is authentic. There was no serial number A#### stamped on the filter label.
"The model # was correct.  However, the filters were not the correct ones.  The perforations at top of filter are smaller than the original filter.  This provokes leakage.  Attached photo so you can see the original filter purchased locally vs those received in the order."
Works like a champ. Turning the water off at the wall helps ease the removal of the old filter.
"I think it half works? It's not a very good imitation because the orignal Samsung product definitely works and you can tell it works. This one, there's a taste to the water, but not as bad as if there was no filter. Taste of water is important to me, this filter doesn't work very well.Wouldn't buy again."
This fits my fridge.  I guess it works.
Easy to install and change. Water tastes great out of our fridge.  I have found it cheaper here on Amazon than at the stores.
Wonderful.  I didn't have to shop all over to find the filters that fit my refrigerator.  They work great.
"right filter, at a much better price than the local big-box store. We've used them a few time now when needed and have no quality problems at all."
Does the job!
buying in the three pack is a great money saver on these filters as they are somewhat expensive individually. They shipped without delay and with no problems.
"Filters are way to expensive, not that thrilled with the refrigerator either."
"Works great, and the price on Amazon is $20 cheaper than at Lowes for the same brand!"
Delivery was fast and delivered before the expected date.Filter was a Samsung and fitted the refrigator perfectly.Very satisfied with the purchase.
"Item works as well as the one that came in the refrigerator originally. Seller was prompt, and this was the best price I've found!"
Exactly how I expected.
After market filters didn't work.  This factory original did the trick.
Best price we could find for two filters.  Works great!
Samsung filters at a great price.
"I only buy original Samsung filters, water always tastes great."
Worked great. I strongly advised to use this original replacement instead of the after market ones. The fit is perfect and water quality is great.
"the first one they sent me did not fit so they were kind enough and they send me a second one free of charge but after I was able to install it the light that indicates that is time to replace the water filter did not go off, so I still have a replace water filter on, I went and I bought another at best buy and the light is off now"
"Arrived on time, was as I needed it. Great product and it was easy to install I am keeping this one and re-ordering."
It was the right filter
"I've bought a couple of these as replacement filters.  As far as water / ice quality goes, I am happy, but I am definitely angry about flow rate.  The filter works fine when brand new out of the box.  After about a month, the water dispenser starts running extremely slow.  Barely a trickle of water.  I can't imagine how it can get ""clogged"" so easily.  When I replace it, the water flows just fine.On previous refrigerator/filter combos I've had, there are no problems running the filter for 5-6 months easily.Next time I am going to try another brand."
"Its a water filter. A bit pricey but it filters the water, which is exactly what I want."
Filters work great and fit in my fridge. Very satisfied with this product. I will order again the next time I need filters.
Works just great for my Samsung 2 door Refigator
OEM product is good but high-priced for multiple quantities.
Easy to change.
I have a very expensive fridge so I am always sure to purchase the correct model of filter in hope it will make it last longer.
"This is a great filter, Been using them for years."
"Perfect filters and correct brand for my fridge.  Still expensive but cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else, by more than $30.00."
I will only buy these for my refrigerator as I tried a generic brand & it leaked all over my floor.
This filter is exactly what we wanted. It is a great value. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a samsung water filter for their refrigerator.
I got exactly what I expected. The price was reasonable. And the delivery was quick. Overall I am not satisfied with the longevity of the filter we had to replace a new filter within the first two months of owning the refrigerator. But purchasing this product was quick and easy.
"Great price, much cheaper than Lowe's or Home Depot.  Works perfectly."
Go to filter for my Refrigerator. Water taste great!
"I needed a replacement filter for my refrigerator.  This filter was the OEM Samsung, but was also cheaper than buying one at the store."
Fits and filters
"Works as expected, and purchased for a much better cost than in-store"
Works as it should
Genuine replacement filters. Fit perfectly.
Does what it is supposed to do ...
"Initially, it didn't fit correctly, but a new pack was sent, and the filter works perfectly."
This filter was easy to install and works just as good as the original that came with my new refrigerator.
Worked great for our samsung refrigerator.
This filter is much better than the aftermarkets. I bought the after market filters and my water still came out with a tint of brown
This was what I wanted. It arrived in perfect shape and excellent time. Thank-You.
Good product and fast delivery
Nikki Todd!!!
Fit my Samsung French Door refrigerator without any difficulty or problems.  I've used it now for about a month without any problems.
"Not sure if there is much to review about a filter, but it worked good, installation was easy, and now my water is clean again!"
Genuine Samsung filter works as expected and easy to install. No issues to report and no leakage. Would be five stars if the price wasn't just stupid high for a plastic filter. Must have since fridge won't work without it.
Just as advertised - works very well.
Not much to say beside that it works as I expected.
Easy to change. No issues
Works better than off brand filters
Costly but does a good job. Received my order in just a few days. Glad I could order on line.
"arrived quickly, fit, doesn't leak."
"Samsung DA29-00020B Refrigerator Water Filter, 1-Pack is the original and I like it.  I used an OEM, but I switched with this one."
What I ordered is what I received. Good product
Fastest Shipping in the industry Great Keep up the good work I am ahappy Customer
"Not sure if this is Genuine filter.First of all it wasn't easy to install. I had to push it in really hard in order to be able to turn and lock it in place.About  month into the use, it got clogged, the water flow was almost non-existent.Finally went to Lowe's and bought another one there. This one got into place easily, the water flow became normal and it it""s still normal two month after the installation."
"Great price, fits perfect.  So easy to change!"
This is the second filter I have purchased for my refrigerator from Amazon. It is a factory replacement and works like advertised.
"Fits well, doesn't leak."
Exactly what I was looking for. Arrived on time.
does the job of what I bought it for
Just what we needed Couldn't find it in the city we live in
Arrived promptly and was the perfect fit at a relatively low cost so was very pleased with how easy it was to order and install.
"The price is right and it fit perfectly! Samsung da 29- 0020b refrigerator water filter, 3-pack  Samsung da 29- 0020b refrigerator water filter, 3-pack"
"Last's about 6 months in our fridge, works as desired."
Great and rapid service! Highest quality for the money!
Works as describe
Works great and cost less than anywhere else I have bought them at
Fit perfectly in the fridge.  Great value compared to buying at a local store or other sites.  Completely satisfied with this purchase.
I stocked up on several of these because we drink so much water in our family that we are replacing filters all the time.  It works like it should and no complaints.
Very good price compared to the appliance store where we purchased the fridge.
Installation was easy and it works great.
Can't beat the price
Perfect
"just great, you have no idea how important you are."
Works great and lasts about 5-6 months!
Excellent - prompt and as advertised!  The water filter fits perfectly and the price is a big savings over buying them one at a time.
As advertised. Perfect fit.
Exactly the product needed and as advertised.
Replaced our Samsung fridge water filter. OEM. Good stuff. We replace ours maybe once every 6-8 months and we have VERY hard well water.
Perfect fit...works great. No leaks.
works as expected.
Good water filter -- keeps water clear and tasting fresh.
Works as expected. I might try cheaper brand next. I don't like being held captive by the manufacturer.
Filters worked as expected and were easy to install.
"very good ,excellent price ,next time I will buy it again ,it works very well.it looks the same as it is in the picture."
A bit expensive but what my fridge needs.
Very good genuine replacement part with no problems. NO chinese after market junkwhat else can i say about this product
"the original filter in the fridge lasted much longer, the OEM Samsung filter replacements are expensive and have a shorter live span the 300 gals claimed. Will try an alternative next time.Shipping and delivery was as promised."
"Fridge still reading red. Should be blue light. Somethings wrong. Maybe it's not the filter. But so far, no good!"
Delivered as expected.  Easy to use and replaces the one in the fridge.  Convenient and cost effective.  Will order again
"When this filter arrived, it did not look exactly as the original one that was in the refrigerator when I bought it. I just assumed it was just a product variance but my! was I wrong. This product is promoted as made to last six months but after I installed, it did not last two months. Right now I am not using water or ice from my refrigerator as it needs a new filter. This is the third month sice I bought this one but it stopped working more than a month ago. Next time I will buy from Samsumg direct. It appears this one was a second hand or very substandard product."
"I will never buy another Samsung appliance again.  I bought a RS261MDRS months ago.  It hadn't been 2 months after purchasing and my refrigerator starting making a buzzing/vibrating noise when dispensing water.  Also, the water flow has slowed down tremendously.  I bought one of these filters hoping the problem would go away. It helped for like a week and regressed back to the previously mentioned problem.  I called Samsung support since I have a year warranty on my refrigerator and they refuse to service it claiming that I have a defected water filter which has no warranty.  SO IF YOU BUY THIS FILTER, YOUR GOING TO BE SOL."
Quick delivery and very fair pricing.  I've been using these refills since we purchased the refrigerator and I'm very pleased with their operation and installation.
Mine worked well..did not have any issue..well they changed the designed little bit but i have no problem..
Works great! Perfect fit!
Fits perfect for the fridge. Does the job.
worked
OK
This was perfect it fit just like we thought! Delivery was so fast!
Perfect fit. No leaks!
Took quite a while to get the filter running clean. Needed to run about 20 gal (recommendation is about 5) through it before the water tasted normal again.
Our water tastes perfect with this filter!
Easier than I thought
"Stop functioning  after 1 1/2 months. Water runs out so slow now.  Same thing happened with last ordered from here, so we thought it needed replacing.  Do not order from here!"
Work as it should.
cost way tooo much
"Easy purchase, reasonable cost and works great!"
It is a good product.  I will continue to use it.  Also It is good for health.  And it is easy to use
OK
"product arrived on time, was easy to install, and works great. Water and ice have a clean and we don't have to buy bottled water."
Nice but expensive!
Works good
"Quality is excelent and they fit just like they are supposed to, water tastes great, but $35 for a water filter? No one else makes one that fits so your stuck. Would get five stars if they were more competitively priced."
"Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend."
"name brand, but a little pricey."
"It is exactly what I needed, it was priced right, and it came quickly. It also was a perfect replacement for the existing one."
Perfect fit.
Product was awesome fit correctly and NO LEAKS!! OEM is the best.
My water's so clean I can see Russia from my house.
"The container was a little dusty, but its doing the job"
Love it👍🏾
Perfect fit. Arrive in 1 day.  Very happy will reorder
Its my 3rd set for my new Samsung Refrigerator. Its original part and easy to install.
"Fit just perfect, been using it for about a week. No complaints yet"
Very good filter.  Will last many months on your refrigerator.
"Seems to be a good filter; water/ice don't have a funny taste or color, but it is on the expensive side."
GREAT DEAL ON THIS FACTORY PRODUCT
It works and it lasts six month.It wold be nice if they had one that lasted longer.There it is.
Great
"Great product, BUT.....the cheaper ones work just as good!!!!!!"
Works great. Easy installation. Fast  arrival.
What can I say?  It arrived speedily. It works as it should.
Works great. Water and ice taste good.
perfect product and double checks the model numbers before purchase
"There is still so many contaminants in the water it's unreal. The taste is like tap water, not worth the money. Glad I also bought a zero water filter so I could compare the two. The zero water won."
It's the filter our fridge requires.  Really don't have a choice.  Seems to work just fine.  .  .  . .
Not much to say other than it's the right filter for my Samsung refrigerator.  Service was great and the price was right.
I buy 3packs and save much more than than Sears sells for the exact same product. I recommend this option to my friends.
"good product, works as advertised. I would purchase again when needed. A little pricey though but was readily available. thanks"
"Im not sure why this particular filter only lasted from Feb 1 - May 1(3 months) before the light filter came on?  As a family we dont actually use the filtered water very much as we buy bottled, however as it cannot be returned I doubt I would buy the filter from the source again in the future.  Disappointed."
Fit perfect and works great
easy to install and works great
Just as advertised - have had no problems.
The right filter for our Samsung Fridge. No issues.
"Not much to say, replacement for my Samsung Fridge. New-in-box. Great price and quick delivery."
Awesome. No issues at all. Fast Shipping!
The item arrived quicker than requested and was the best per unit pricing for the filter. We go through these every 6 months.
Easy to replace. Water tastes very clean and refreshing. Ours doesn't last as long as it states since we drink lots of water in our house.
"Been working fine and good replacement part, no leaks."
Installed per the directions and not a single issue.  Just run the water for a few gallons after installation and everything is back to normal.
Fast delivery and as ordered  Works great.  What else can be said for a water filter.  Does the job well.
replaced the old filter - works well
"It worked great when I first got it but stopped working altogether 6 weeks later.  Water wouldn't come out of the water dispenser and the ice container was completely empty.  When we took the filter out, the water started working again immediately.  This has never happened before with any filter.  It was just past the 30-day return window so there was nothing I could do about it.  I would be wary of buying a filter from this seller.  It looks like the real thing but I don't understand why it stopped working so quickly."
"Great product, arrived quickly"
"A little pricey, but average good product."
Timely delivery and exactly what was stated in the advertisement. Fit perfectly.
This is a great quality OEM replacement part at the BEST price available online.  I will definitely purchase more in the future as needed.
We had purchased one from here and it was awful.  This filter works great.
"Looks like all other filters we have used for our Samsung fridge, but even after running three gallons of water through to clear it, the water tastes foul. It tastes stale and chemical. Never had this problem before and it’s unusable."
"This filter is NOT compatible with model # RS265TDRS. I can't comment on how it works since it wouldn't fit in my fridge, packaging and everything was fine but had to pay for shipping to return it."
Worked Perfectly!
Price is great but one of the filters was faulty. Noticed too late to return. The refrigerator started to make a grinding noise when dispensing water which stopped when I changed the filter.
"Worked great in our RF4289HARS Samsung fridge.  No need to turn off the water as recommended, 10 second swap and she's good to go, I ordered 2!"
Good deal.  Works fine.  I don't need the box.
Good
"this does filter the water nicely from a flavor standpoint, but it gets cobbed up so quickly, it slows the water to a trickle. We finally just removed it from our fridge permanently, as we already have an under-sink filter transporting water to the fridge."
"I'm thinking I probably got a defective item. Within a month of its being installed, the flow of water from my dispenser went down to a trickle. Turns out it was the filter. I'll buy again and hope for more longevity."
"Filters water, but slows the flow."
Good filter
On first one now-works well so far!
Happy
Awesome for the price. EXACT same filter at Lowes cost $8.00 more (and Lowes was out of stock!)
"I love it, great price for the 3 pack!!!"
"doesn't leak, using the Samsung was recommended by the manufacturer."
This is the correct filter for the samsung refrigerators. It is better to use the original samsung filter than a generic version.
"Buy the real thing - Don't get imitations, these work and the others don't."
We needed a new filter for our refrigerator. This was a great buy. Will most certainly order from here again if the price is right.
It works fine
exactly what I needed.
Perfect Replacement Filter for my Refrigerator!!! Will be purchasing again in the next 5-6 months.
I only use this one for my Samsung reefer.
Good product.  Pricey.
Good
Item as described.  Shipping 5 star
works great and cheaper than buying it at the store.
"Gotta love it. I have a Samsung refrigerator. Plus, it does a great job filtering my water. Long lasting also."
Easy to change
Product worked as advertised.  Will buy again.
"Same product I usually buy, but at a price that was a little more reasonable, and a lot more convenient. Arrived in excellent condition."
good
very nice
It has been a good little filter. I haven't had any problems out of it so far. I would buy it again.
"easy replacement and worked my model of samsung. The water warning reset, So now I know this filter will work for my fridge."
even though it's a little more expensive it operated better than expectations will definitely buy another one
"A fine value for the price. Prompt delivery, and they work fine."
Great for the price
Does it's job and came on time. Not difficult to install and I didn't need to turn off the water to do so.
Works perfect.
Works just fine.  I'd order it again.
Better price than other sources. But other brands can be bought for even less online and they work the same.
"I bought a cheaper brand and it leaked all over my kitchen.  Pay the extra money for the Samsung brand, it's worth every penney."
Water filter must be changed regular or you will see small ice cubes or no ice or water.  Works great.
They fit even tho the model was off by one letter. They went in and have been working great. Would recommend to a friend.
Fit our fridge perfectly and almost 1/2 the price of ordering through Sears!!
Love my Samsung fridge and the way the water filter is so easy to change. Water is good tasting every time.
works great
"I ordered two,  Only one arrived, and the price for one is almost double what it should be.  This will be the last time I order this product.  I will go to the local store instead."
Dont waste your money on cheap imitation filters. Get the OEM one like this and be worry free against fit and leaks.
Exactly as expected.
works as described-water tastes fine. i will probably buy the twin pack next time and save a little money..shipping was incredibly fast as well.
"This works great and doesn't leak, like off brands can."
This filter fit perfectly and works very well.  Will not hesitate to buy this again.  Can't go wrong buying recommended filter.
"These are the factory water filters, and are a third of the price compared to local stores in this area. They are a great deal."
Great tasting replacement water filter for Samsung refrigerator
nice
Superior and higher rated filtration than budget filters.
Great service and convenience.  I would only use Samsung brand filters.  What else can you say about a water filter?
"As usual, no issues!!"
"Nice price and is the one I needed, I always by the two pack, one for the spring and one for the fall,"
Fit nice and easy into our Samsung refrigerator.
"I'm not sure if this product can be found in stores, but Amazon always has items at a cheaper price. I received my product in two days which made it even better!"
"Does what it needs to do. Easy to install. Only replacing once a year, so opted for the more expensive one. definitely worth it. no problems."
Have Nice filtered water now..installed fairly easily.
as expected
"product as described, will purchase again, prime shipping. water tasted great will re up in a couple of months for next purchase"
Much better value than last time I purchased.
"Lasted about a month.  These filters seem to have a progressively shorter lifespan--I replaced the filter in January, then again at the end of April, and now it needs to be replaced again as the water trickles so slowly from the dispenser that it takes about a full minute to fill up a glass of water.  Doesn't seem like it's worth the cost to buy brand-name filters if they only last a month."
wow great price...fit perfect.  works fine for me.  thank you very much.
Water flow is super slow. A cheaper alternative works much better.
Would order these again! There were no issues with changing the filter. Simple to do and a perfect fit. I have pure water again. Thank you.
Had about a month and seems to be working great.  Looks just like the original manuf. model
"Filter did not remove the ""bad"" taste from the well water"
Hard to find the actual Samsung Water Filter.  Glad I can get online.  Good price.
Love that it gets delivered so i do not have to go fund this part in stores.... reasonably priced.
"As advertised... seems to work just like original equipment. Delivered on time and in new packaging. I have no complaints, would recommend."
Just as described.
Excellent  product and price. Performs as well as prior filter I paid twice the price. Identical product I purchased at big box.
works as advertised
Over priced and quality dropped off after 4 months. After 4 months the water starts developing a funky taste and tap water even tastes beter than it.
"I was concerned after reading a lot of the bad reviews but I had good luck before so I decided to roll the dice this time. The one I got looked original but after running 5 gallons of water through it, I was still getting white particles in the water. It could possibly be a fake but a very good fake. Or it could just be a defective unit. I went and bought one from store for a few more bucks and it gave clear water after about 3-4 gallons flushing. I bought directly from amazon and not a third party vendor"
Good replacement water filter. Work as intended. Easy to install with no leaks. I would recommended.
I purchased this product after I read the review.  It works fine and at a great price.  I will buy more.
"This is the real OEM part, and it is currently the best value out there.  Why would you overspend when you have this choice?"
clean water
I have a great deal of alkali in my water. I use these filters in my Samsung frig w/ no alkali build-up.
Love it
Easy replacement. Factory original
Great filter. water is tasty out of the fridge tap.
Fit the refridgerator perfectly.
Great price for two water filters for my Samsung French Door Refrigerator.. Two for the price at one can't be beat.
"Fit my fridge, makes water taste better"
Works great...very satisfied with product and arrival time. Will definetly order from amazon when we need a water filter replacement in the future.
Good product
GREAT PRICE
Came on time and worked great
delivered as promised and working as expected.
filter is fine this is what my refrgerator takes so thats what I get.  Water taste great. I ahave a samsung fridge as well
Seem to work great as a replacement water filter
A little pricey.
Works as expected.
It is right for my Samsung freezer
"This was a great price from Amazon on this filter for my refrigerator.This filter works great, easy to install and remove the old one."
"The Samsung water filter is perfect, installs very easy and I have no problems. Would recommend using Samsung water filters"
Samsung must be making a fortune on these.  I wish they would last longer.  We've had our frigerator for almost a year now and have already gone through two of these.
perfect
Works good.
The filter fit and worked fine in my refrigerator. Just what I had asked for with out any problems. Thank you.
pricy but good
As described
So easy to install. Works like a charm
as described.  I stuck with name brand but IMO these are over priced
Work great in my frig and a lot cheaper than having to buy the maker's brand.
Just the right product and great service. Thank you
Ir esa fine
Price
Item was well packed and worked as expected
works well
"We bought these replacement filters from Amazon and it will not fit anymore. I called Samsung support and when asked to provide the serial number, I found out that this is not Genuine even when the box said it was. I feel such disappointment because it is not fair to mislead customers with these type of products.  I will not recommend buying this product."
It was easy to change!
"fast shipping, exactly as described."
This is the fourth filter I have purchased for my Samsung refrigerator. It fits and works every time.
This is a great product.  Works great in my Refrigerator.  Easy to install.  I love having extra's on hand when time to change my filter.
Unit was as specified and fit.
"Great price, does the job"
Fits my Ref!
Really work well. Just do not like the price.
Bought this water filter as it was the recommended filter for my refrigerator. The price was great and so was the shipping.
super easy replacement filter and it was great to have amazon deliver it to my door.
We have use these for several years Seems to do the job
We like the filter. The only concern I have is the water flow is slower since we got this filter. It serves its purpose.
Best you can get for the price.
Good price for filters.
The water fliter works..but it's a bit pricey!
fits as works as advertised - fast shipping through Prime!
This is exactly what i expected. The delivery was fast. I really appreciate the fast handling and the product quality.
This filter cost twice as much anywhere else. I loved getting it so cheap and it fits perfectly in my Samsung Refrigerator.
Filter works great and at a much better price than any store I could find to compare it to. Will purchase again.
"Bought this filter because it was cheaper by $10.00 than my local home center. Replaced my old one with this, then ordered 2 more."
Same exact filter
Great Filter and lasts. Usually get 7 - 9 months off one filter and our water dispenser is used everyday and quite often.
just what I needed came in handy great filter
THE WATER FROM THS FILTER TASTE GREAT.  THE FILTER IS A BIT EXPENSIVE BUT LAST 6 MONTHS.IT IS VERY EASY TO INSTALL AND STARTS WORKING IMMEDIATELY.
Not as good as Zero water filter
Worked perfectly for the 6-month time frame.
Works exactly as you would expect.  No leaking which was a major issue with the off brand products. Very happy.
Just got the replacement filter and is the factory model.  Was much cheaper than the previous one I bought at Lowes.
Correct product with fast delivery. Thank you
Excellent product. A little expensive.
This product when used cuts off the water supply to the water dispenser. When I unlock the filter it works and when I put it in locked position it cuts off the water supply. What do I need to do?
"Lasts 7-8 months with heavy use family of 3; orange light in 7 months, pink after 8.  Good price to boot"
Grear
I love it !
Samsung water filter is great for my refrigerator. My wife loved this filter. It's easy to replace and the water tastes great.
"Great product, save me lots of money"
"Arrived quickly, popped the old one out, popped this one in, perfect fit.  Worked great, can't ask for more than that."
"Bought this filter for my samsung refrigerator. The model number said it fits within few mins after installation, it started make knocking noise. Took it out re-installed it and dispensed couple of gallons of water, still same problem. The filter is defective, when i shake the filter in my hand I can hear and feel something inside rattling. Since I bought this a while back, now I stuck with it after paying lot of money."
"Good quality water filter. I am buying them from the same seller for few years. Works good, installation is simple and it does the job."
Great quality for half the price than I would have paid at Lowes.  Just love buying on Amazon.
Works perfectly.
The exact filter that our refrigerator requires. Excellent condition & did the job!
My fridge is running the way it should and it is exactly what it needed to do so. Great product. Thank you
Way cheaper than buying it from the big blue box store.  This was a perfect fit for my Samsung fridge.
Does the job good price and availability as hard to find in stock sometimes.
nice
the price for this product through Amazon helps us cut our costs when we have to replace this filter. It is great.
A great way to buy Samsung water filters.
Works great! not a cheep substitute.
This got here fast - and I needed that!
Does an excellent job and good tasting water
One of these filters is $50 anywhere you can find them at a retail store. Two filters last our family nearly a year.
Fits our new Samsung refrigerator. We had tried 2 big box stores and neither one would fit. Price is better also.
"Samsung filters are the best, after market are not as good, tried them and they tasted terrible."
My wife claims she can taste the difference in filters. All is well with this one! Will be ordering another. Thanks.
Just as described!
"Filters are working fine. Had no problems installing it. Good price, a lot better than the local stores."
Filter is easy to install and the water tastes good but a water company tested the water and I was asked if it was a carbon filter. We didn't know. He said filter wasn't that great.
Received quickly. Good product.
Works great
Let the rating speak.
"Just what I needed, arrived quickly and works like it should.  Just took out the old one and put in the new one."
Very good  productI like it and is very important easy to build in .so i want only samsung genuine parts
"Amazon has the best price for this filter, and of course it is exactly what I need for my refrigerator."
Very nice.
Amazon send mo a used filter. Paid full price and you get used water filter! What a Joke!
got on time and fit perfectly!
This is an OEM product. It fit perfectly and was easy to install.
"have had problems with other, but this one works great."
This filter works as designed for my fridge. I've bought 2 of these with no issues.
A perfect replacement
"Delivered on time , performed as expected."
Great deal !!! I ordered two for the price I would pay for one in my local store.
Works great!
It met Samsung's refrigerator specifications and complied with quality standards.
Just what my new Samsung refrigerator needed.
"It's a filter, so there's really nothing to brag about except for the fact that I paid less for it through Amazon."
"This filter fit my refrigerator as described, It is very easy to install without even turning the water off first."
Works great
It came as described on the webiste.........What can I Say.....it filters water.....lol and it tastes good! I would recommend it to my friends
Perfect
Great product.  Amazon is cheaper than local dealers!
Original Samsung filters - fit and work perfectly.
this filter is excellent
Great price for this Water Filter for my Samsung Refrigerator.  Well packaged and received as promised. Easy to remove old filter and install the new filter.
Reliable.
Easy to install. Had it a month with no problems.
works perfectly
Delivered quickly and was the right unit and instructions helped me replace it. Good Deal!!
"Very good product,  no problems,  easy install,  works great!! I would recommend buying this product for your refrigerator for sure."
"Perfect replacement for our fridge, Samsung RS265TDWP.  I noticed a significant improvement in water quality after changing the previous filter."
These filters work great direct replacement no problems water tastes delicious. Great price
Exact replacement for the original.  Have purchased off-brand filters in the past and there' s no comparison.
So far so good.  Make sure you turn off the water before installing or you could get wet.
"This product foes exactly what it is supposed to do, filter water. Will be buying again next time my filter light comes on."
"This is easy to fit in my samsung refrigerator.Works fine and no issue.Not yet sure how long it would last effective, though."
"Item original manufacture part, good price!. . . .. . . . .. . .!, l ,, , , , , ,"
Great price.
This is a reorder.
"If you own a Samsung refrigerator, don't use non-Samsung filters."
Fits very well
Great price
Good.
Expensive but worth it
Expensive but aren't they all overpriced?
So much cheaper here. Will be back for more... Great deal!!!!!
Amazon is the place to buy these. Original Samsung product. Buy these.
I wish I wasn't required to write so many words. What more can be said other than it replaced the other filter and went in easy.
Good product
As soon as I replaced my old filter it stopped dispensing.  I have done this a few times in the past so I know it isn't something I am doing.  Save yourself the headache and buy these direct from Lowes or Walmart.
Installed easily and works.
The filter is great! Samsung makes a fantastic refrigerator and I have never had a problem with their water filters..
Good product. Was much cheaper than the local appliance stores in my area. This is the OEM filter for your Samsung fridge.
"I am a senior citizen female and I found it to be easy to install & works great, it was a genuine Samsung part."
I have nothing bad to say.  Got it when it was expected to be here and is in and working grew.
"Works great so far almost 2 months in. Love having ice. Glad to be in 1979 finally. Hey, want some ice?"
No complaints here. Easy to install and works great. I struggled with choosing the oem vs cheaper and went with this.
seems to work fine
good
good
"Its a water filter, it filters water."
Exactly as expected (factory original)  What else can I say?!!This is the same as the filter supplied with the refrigerator
As good as you get in the store but way cheaper!
It is half the price of what I can get it at a local store.  Genuine part for my Samsung refrigerator.....
Arrived quickly.  Waiting for old filter to meet end of life to install.
Price for the 3 sure beats buying singles.
"Shortly after replacing our third filter (purchased 3 pack), our water started to taste extremely salty and the texture of the water seems strange.Even though there were quite a few remarks regarding poor tasting water, we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, the reviews are correct. Will not purchase again."
I read reviews before i bought it and hesitated.I will definitely buy it again. Easy to replace it and water taste good.
The filters fit right into the Samsung fridge. Why take a chance on a generic brand?
"This was exactly what I was looking for! Easy installation instructions, I will absolutely get another one."
"Fits my refrigerator and installed without turning off the water supply.  I rated it three stars because it is a water filter, hard to ""love"" it even though the price is half what other retailers charge."
Great price and the fit was perfect!
"Expensive, but about the same as market price."
"Fit my Samsung RF32FMQDBSR fridge perfectly, installed quickly and easily, does what it's supposed to do."
"ok, but cost is high"
"This is the standard filter for my refrigerator.  It always works perfectly with my frig, so I have no complaints."
"Best price, bought the name brand after reading the reviews for the off brand filters, will buy again. Arrived with other items very fast"
"Filters are good, however better option is to install whole house filter at once ;)"
Works great in my Samsung refrigerator.
Good replacement part
Replacement filter fit perfectly. The best part of it all is the fact it was almost $15 cheaper than Best Buy or anywhere else locally that I could find.
"It is original , however you can buy the samsung original filter form their website 20 dollar cheaper. also i tried to return taks 8 dollar drop of money. so its a trap"
Fits correctly. Works well.
It is really work good.This time is the third time that I ordered this one.Only this one work great.
"oem product fitted right in, price was cheaper compare to the store"
Shipped fast & fit prefectly
Affordable price and does the job. Thanks Samsung for making this product.  I will definitely purchase this in the future.
THIS PRODUCT MEETS SAMSUNG REQUIREMENTS
"Perfect fit, easy to install, and taste quality is good. Shipping was fast and the item was well packaged."
Works great for our refrigerator - no complaints - water and ice taste great running through this filter - does the job
NO ISSUES... Replaced old filter with no problems... it is a Samsung filter..as advertised it works perfectly.. quick delivery. THANKS
"I wasn't sure how to rate this, since the water filters purchased through Amazon seem to be working well. However, I had a problem with the same filter when purchased directly from Samsung. That filter leaked and had to be replaced before expiration"
When it comes to filters stick with the manufacturer
The product is the same filter I buy anywhere else but at a lower price.I am very satisfied.
Just what I needed and at a great price. This is a substitute for the previous model number that is no longer made.
I have used several of these and not had a problem with any of them.  Seems to to the job.
So far so good!  No leaks as of yet nor strange noises.
Much better than the cheaper ones.
Great filter and fits great with the fridge. My water tastes super yummy being filtered.
Was much more expensive at Lowes for exact same product. Great value.
Good quality.
Works great for my samsung fridge. $20 dollars cheaper than buying for best buy and works just as good!
Package arrived on-time and installation took less than 5 minutes. I would definitely order again.Guess if the 2 pack was cheaper I would purchase.
You really can taste the difference in the water when you use this product!  Long lasting and fairly good value.
OEM replacement.  Works.  No issues.
Great buy and reasonable in price
"Received as promised, packaged ok.  Love these filters!!"
Good product.
works but two expensive
Can't go bad with original equipment
I have been purchasing this product for about 4 years and am happy with its performance.
Easy to change.  Water tastes great. Might have known amazon had this at a good price.
what can I say? It's the one that fits my refrigerator. Though I thought it funny that two singles cost less than a 2-pack.
"Product works perfectly. Easy to 'install.' Provides clean, fresh tasting water. Wish it didn't need to be changed as often."
We have been using these filters via subscribe and save via amazon for 6 years. The one we got in September had an sticky adhesive residue under the cap seal. Had I not noticed I would have placed directly into the fridge.
"It works great!  It was cheaper than Lowes and Amazon had it in stock.  My water tastes great, recommend to everyone."
"They fit perfectly.  Did not leak, etc"
It worked perfect and it was delivered right away.  Very Happy with the delivery time!
Arrived quickly and best value around.
It was exactly what I needed and works great. I will order this again when I need one. Thank you!
"The two-pack offers a great price; fast delivery, easy install.  Recommend buying these (Samsung) replacement filters instead of after-market filters."
"Arrived on time and well wrapped. Works great, installs easily and makes the water taste better than a water bottle from the supermarket."
Works really good very happy with purchase much cheaper than  In store
It is a great filter
"The DA29-00020B Samsung Refrigerator Water filter was exactly as described, arrived when estimated but best of all it was a great price, I will buy from this vendor again."
"Exactly as pictured for a great price, considering all alternate hands on places such as best buy. Works great and easy to install."
Fits perfectly
Great Seller.  Got the product as promised.  Will for sure use again.
Good product works as advertised😀
worked as expected
Original replacement filter for Samsung refrigerator at good price and convenience of ordering through amazon.  Received the filters I ordered within an week.
First one lasted 6 months b4 the fridge turned on the change light. Good price.
"it fit like a glove, and was very easy to install. the price was so much better than my local store."
"Not much to say, works great and is cheaper than buying it at the store."
Good price.  Thanks.
"competitive price, fast delivery."
It didn't work as the original that came with the fridge. Ice maker start to work wrong and we need to buy a other filter directly with Samsung.
Great Item.
Matches the refrigerator's specs exactly.  Decent price.  Easy to install.  I am very satisfied with the purchase of this product.
"Item sounded like it had air bubbles for a couple of days, but now everything works like the original filter"
Works Great!
"Very nice, no issues so far."
These filters fit great and do a good job of filtering the water. Will buy again.Other filters did not fit well according to reviews.
"Easy to install and does a good job of filtering water, I never buy bottled water anymore."
Worked as described.
I got a Great price with a very quick delivery.  This is where I plan to get my water filters.
It's ok to fix in my freeze .
Works great. Had a hard time installing it but after I turned the water supply off I had no problem.
"Just what we needed, but the color is not the LED bright that matches the rest of the refrigerator.  I would have preferred the color to match.  It was a speedy fast delivery."
"Brand new, sealed in the box! Exactly the same one I have been buying at Lowes for 44.00. A very good value!"
It was the first time buying experience for this item. I will keep ordering this item for replacement in the future. A++
The perfect filter for our Samsung refrigerator. Easy to install.
Very expensive!
"great, it worked as promissed, easy to use and it was delivered on the rigth time, it is totally recomended"
Great
Works well great for your samsun Refrigator.
Water pressure is back in my fridge after I switched back to the Samsung version.
The product says it will last for 6 months but in actual it will just last 3 months. Not happy with the marketing of Samsung it did not live to the hype.
After 5 months in use this filter has all but stopped the water flow from the dispenser. Filling a glass takes over a minute.  Just removed it and water came out like it should. We are on filtered city water so is virtually no sediments to remove. Rather than spending $50 every six months to reduce our waterflow to a trickle I think we will just skip itSamsung rf28hfedbsr Refrigerator and Samsung Genuine DA29-00020B Filter
"Worked fine, easy install."
Not only satisfied - it was half the price we have been paying at Lowe's!
"These filters have a double o-ring gasket around the top lip and did not work correctly in our fridge.  We've ordered several in the past that had a single o-ring gasket that worked well.I called Samsung and they said that they actually have multiple products with the same DA29-00020B part number - which is very confusing.  They also said they can only help me if i order the product from their samsungparts.com website, which was annoying."
worked great
Works well and as advertised. Easy to install.
Great!!
"a great replacement for the old filter - and it installed very quickly, with no problems."
Goes quickly doesn't last long and is more for taste rather than filtering
Need to order more
"I brought an OEM replacement that said it fit my Samsung fridge, but caused leaks.  This one fits with no issues."
Fit my fridge just fine. Water filtered great. Does what it's supposed to.
This is a perfect replacement for the one that came with my new fridge. Lasts 6 months with average use.
This was a perfect transaction and exactly what I needed to replace the old water filter in my fridge. Recommended.
Ok
THE FILTER FIT PERFECTLY AND WAS JUST WHAT WE NEEDED AND ALSO CHEAPER THAN THE STORE WE BOUGHT THE REFRIGERATOR FROM.
Filter is exact replacement to the original. I got it a lot faster than expected....I would recommend this filter to anyone.
Good product. Replaced it and reset the filter indicator light. Works like a champ so far. The quality is good.
much cheaper than any where locally.  It worked perfectly.
"Works as advertised, filter for Samsung refrigerators. Installed with no issues, no leaks."
Perfect
these are very good filters.  For us they last about 6 months with 6 household members.
Excellent
Good filtered water taste great
great and easy install
fits and works fine
Good product. Easy installation but remember to turn your water off at your fridge before installation. OK OK OK ok
excatly fit for Samsung Refrig
Tried a different brand the last time.  The original work better for not much more cost. I will stick with these.
"It appears to be the same filter I had originally ordered from Samsung. Easy to install, just follow directions."
Works I guess - is that what I paid for?
"Bought this saved a bit of hey and easy to replace, no leaking issues like some had. Working great! Thanks"
It works like a original!
Great filters and price!!
Fit perfectly and saved me some money!
Exactly what I needed. Shopped around for a good price and this was the best. Arrived in 2 days and the price was unbeatable.
Fits and works
Decent delivery time and was easy to install.
"Looks like they will work, have not installed yet"
The price is still cheaper on Amazon than best buy. It's the real filter
Does the job.
Love it
"Great price, much more expensive at big box stores."
Good price. This was easy to replace. I think it was cheaper to buy it single rather than the multipack..
This is a replacement water filter for my Samsung refrigerator.  It is perfect replacement.It costs 50% less than offered by Sears
Perfect worked exactly as advertised
"good, it is same as my old one"
Fits and was a good price
It's a filter. Works great. Not sure what else to say about it. Why do I have to type so many words?
I have a Samsung refrig.  the filters are a snap to change and work great!  couldn't ask for anything more.
"Keeps our water tasting fresh, expensive but we feel it is worth it."
"This product was sold by Amazon (directly), so I had no worries.  All Original and genuine."
As advertised.
worked great
"Relatively easy to replace, fit perfect and works great."
Works well.
Worked great.  Will buy again.
This is the first time I have ordered these filters and they fit perfectly and work well.  I would buy these again.
"Great water filter, my water tastes great using official Samsung filters!"
This is a great deal for (3) filters! Don't waste money or time getting one at a time. So much cheaper then Lowe's as well.
It works! And I love my Samsung fridge. What can I say. I'll order more soon in bulk. Thank you
Shipment was fast and the product performs as advertised. This filter works for me. The water tastes good. I recommend it.
This turned out to be a fake filter.  We couldn’t figure out why the water tasted so bad (never had this happen before).  I finally bought a new filter from a local store and compared the filters and it was clear that this was fake Samsung product.  Just beware when purchasing.
This water filter keeps my water and ice clean and helps my refrigerator works better. I can drink the refrigerator water because it's safe.
These are definitely original parts and fit our refrigerator perfectly. I like the fact the vendor sells it in a multi-pack for a great value.
Pricey for a filter
Excelent
This item is identical to the item supplied with our refrigerator when purchased.  It works very well with no problems.
Arrived as expected
Works like a charm! So far no complaints.
"Arrived quickly, product as advertised, easy to install."
Price is right---they are the correct filters for my refrig---- I have ordered these filters before and they work well
"Right product, shipped and arrived as advertised."
What can i say? It is a water filter. The water tatse great through the filter than I get from the tap.
fits and works great
Standard Samsung product works as it was ment to.  Great price for the real thing.
It is the exact fit. Took less than a minute to remove the old one and replace it with new filter.
works great
Does the job and not retail pricing.
"Worked as adv. But expensive, will try the generic next time"
"Original manufacturer brand equipment, works as intended. Amazon had the best price. It was easy to install if you follow directions."
"I'll always rate these low.  Come on guys, it's just a filter!  Now if it doubled as a flashlight or never had to be replaced, THEN we'd have a 5 star product!"
clean water yum
"Great price, much better than what you pay at lowes"
No issues.  Good price. Ontime delivery. Easy installed
Worked great and cheaper than in store.
"better prices than anywhere, hhgreg is selling this for too much money.This is a great price !!!!!!lov it"
perfect
Perfect fit as advertised. Offical Samsung product not Knockoff product. Whim and easy replacement part. I will order this product again.
Excelent working! Dont buy the cheapers.
The real thing for a great price.  Thanks!
Everything we expected.
"Work great !! And price was better than other sites, etc. by a few dollar's (Literally)."
Easey Peasy.
"awesome, came quickly; fits, and saved me money buying thru Amazon instead of store."
"The website said, this was genuine Samsung water filter, but it is fake. After installing and drinking water using this filter, made me sick. Water immediately made my tongue tingle and hurt my throat. I would not recommend anyone buying this water filter."
Good quality. Great price.
Very good. Easy to install and the last ones lasted and performed good.Will buy again.
I loved ordering this on line a time saver.  It got here quickley and saved me a lttle money but ordering on line.
They worked great. Thanks.
It was the same that I buy in the store
"No complaints, excellent seller to work with!"
Works great in our fridge and it's nice to know our water is clean :)
OEM filters are the way to go for me.  These work great.
Worked just like the one I paid twice the price for at the local supply store. Thank you.
It was also very easy to install
"This is the filter suggested by samsung for my rwfrigerator. Fits great, clean, clear ice and great tasting drinking water."
"perfect fit, great price"
"I love the multiple packaging. Now I have on hand when filter needs changing. Price was great and it came very quickly,"
"This was the best price we found these for.  With prime you get it quickly, easy to install. Water tastes great."
Real samsung filters. Zero problem with installation AND operation. 5 stars.
works perfectly
This is the second filter I have ordered and have never had a problem.
Had this installed. Had the water tested and compared the tap water to the water from the fridge going through this filter. Absolutely minimal difference in total dissolved solids (the number of particles in the water). What a waste of 50$. I tried to make a claim with Samsung with no luck. Get the amazon basics one and save 20-30$
No problem with the order delivery.
This is the same filter sold at Sears for a lot more money. It works great and saved me money
"Got what I ordered, and fast. This is the second time I order this and no problems so far. Go for it."
"The two pack is a great deal, and was very easy to install.  My water tastes great through this filter."
Easy to install and keeps water soft. Make the 3-pack less expensive than the single and I will be buying again.
"As a product for the Samsung refrigerators, this filter should last about a 6 months and sometimes even more! When I bought this online it only lasted a little over a month. I know for sure it wasn't the one I had specifically bought because I bought it again after that and It gave up on me after a month again! This is a waste of money!!! DO NOT BUY! The seller also made it where you can't return the product after a month... I HIGHLY encourage you to just buy at sears or HHGREGG or any other stores because it will save you the money!"
The Filters arrived very fast and were packed well.I did not have any problems replacing the one in my refrigerator at all.very good purchase
My refrigerator water has never tasted so good.  So fresh...so clean.
very hard to put in without leaking but works as described
Easy replacement without any issues.
Samsung makes the world's worst refrigerators.
What more can you say about a water filter.  Was easy to install but thats really up to the refrigerator.
Great value filters!
All as expected.
Just what I needed!
Easy to install.  Doesn't last as long as I'd like but that's life.
Good filters. Last about a year. Less expensive than the stores.
Filter does what it's suppose to do! Water tastes great
Excellent product and I will surely recommend it to others and continue to purchase it.
Pleased with this item.
Filter did exactly as it was supposed to do. Worked perfectly in my fridge. I recommend this product to everyone!
"Good product, Only by original equipment such as this if you want good results."
"good performance, good packaging."
great value
Love it
Lasted a month and a half.
"It is exactly like the one I bought at the store but a better price, I will definitely reorder this again."
Good Product!
Great filters for a great cost.
"Unit failed after 3 days, had to go to Lowes and buy a replacement.  In the past there have been no failures so this is new thing for me.  I did learn that if you take the filter out you can run the water.  So if water stops being supplied you can remove the filter and see if it starts again.  If the water does not come on then the filter is not the culprit.  If it does then the filter has failed for some reason."
"It serves the purpose of filtering water!  My only negative with the item is that for some reason, the refrigerator kept popping it out, even though it was the correct size for our fridge."
No issues.
"Went in with minimum amount of trouble, will see how long it lasts."
Fits and works perfectly as advertised. Would recommend to anyone that has a Samsung refrigerator that uses this type filter.
Good Product
This is everything you've ever wanted in a refrigerator water filter.
fit great but are way to expensive.
delivery was on time...what can one say about a disposable water filter
It works perfectly on my Samsung RS26DDAPN1/XAP. I've bought this item twice. I live in Costa Rica and it last almost 6 months.
Met my expectations.  Water quality is better than generic brands.
"Very pleased. These work beautifully, and it's so nice to order and forget."
"Works great every time, no worries, no issues."
Very happy with these refrigerator filters.  Great price too.
"Exact match, works great."
"These water filters are designed for my Samsung refrigerator, and operate leak free."
no issues to post
Works great :)
Perfect for the price! Legit deal! Glad they sell the good stuff for cheaper than Sears or other stores. PERFECT.
Just like the one that was in my refrigerator when I bought it....
Fit my new Samsung refrigerator and easy to install.
Arrived on time and was as advertised
As expected
It was perfect and your delivery always amazes me.
The price for this filter beat the local home centers and everything was as advertised. What more do you need?
perfect filter and replacement and lower cost than retail stores.
this product left me with the expected results and a quality satisfaction. I recommend it for anyone who has a Samsung refrigerator.
perfect
Works like a charm on my fridge! No confusion and comes packaged secure. It is exactly what it is! A filter
"The filter we ordered was the correct one and it Fit perfectly. Would order it again, no problem with it."
Cheaper by the bundle.
"After looking around online for this product, we found that this was the best price and fits correctly in our refridgerator."
Good product
Works well.
yes it met my expectations. was exactly what I wanted.  Thank you
Works like a champ and less expensive than going to store to get them.
Excellent price! These are typically $50-$60 in the store and does an excellent job.
This is a perfect replacement water filter for our fridge. Very easy to change out on our fridge as well.
Works well and the price is right
Yup.......  What can I say....  It Filters Water.....  Delivered as stated on time.......
Works great as my original filter needed to be replaced. Perfect fit and absolutely no problems.
It works as expected!
Love having extra filters on hand!
Filter fits perfect and works great.  No issues at all.
"Worth the extra money to buy  OEM, fits and works great"
This filter was great. We had no problems with changing the water filter. Would purchase again when we need another filter.
It's working properly as expected.
I thought the price was reasonable. It's easy to install.The ice and water are very clean after replaced new filter.
"worked great, easy to install."
As usual arrived quickly with prime order and product was easily placed in refrigerator.
"Easy to install, stock filter for the fridge.  Much cheaper than I would pay in store."
Works really well. Just what i wanted.
works well
"Easy install for this.  I bought for my Samsung fridge that came with a slightly different model, but this one works great"
Great product and great price.
"What's there to say, it is a factory replacement filter.  Works fine, fit is perfect, and the water taste great."
Works very well and was easy to install.
Since my Samsung refrigerator takes this filter it was a perfect fit!
Factory filter for my Samsung refrigerator and around $20 cheaper than Lowes or Home Depot. This is a no brainer.
Leaks a bit but does the job
great filter-great service!!
It filters water
ok
Another  low for Amazon.  This ~$80 two pack of filters appeared OPENED and with only 1 of the two filters.  RETURN.
"After I changed the filter the red indicator for filter does nor disappear, they are fake products, will return, what waste of my time and effort!"
What can I say it is a necessity and the right price.It fit in our new refrigerator and we will be back.
Exactly what I need. Much cheaper than samsung website. Shipped very quickly.Not available in best buy although we bought the refrigerator from there.
Perfect but too expensive
"Package had a label added that said “Thanks to you, this product has a second life.”  It appears to be refurbished.  I expected a new filter.  If it says different in the description, I missed it."
"While a little pricey, they are the original equipment replacement filter.  Had no problems with this except that it was expensive."
This did not say Samsung on the filter.  My OEM part did.  However it works fine.  I gave three stars for the misleading information.
"What can I say it filters, over priced ,but I blame Me for buying a fridge that requires this ."
Worked well
"Expensive, but cheaper than lowes"
Exactly like the one you can get in store for our fridge filter. Works very well. Will get again for sure!
These are a great product.  They are not a knock off replacement.
Great product
"Problem is, you have real odd tasting water for the first few days.  I suppose it is because it needs to run awhile through the filter. Samsung makes awesome products....hope they can work on this."
Fits our fridge perfectly and easy to install
Perfect Thank you
"I had the same exact experience as the previous reviewer.  Bought a new Samsung refrigerator, filter warning light came on for original filter after 6 months.  Bought a two pack of these, installed one and worked fine.....for a month and a half.  Water then slowed to a trickle. Took that one out, put in the other new one.  Same exact thing; worked fine for a month and a half.  Water is now once again at barely a trickle coming out.  Thought these were the name brand so I could be assured of quality.  Do Not Buy These!!"
Filter fits my Samsung refrigerator as advertised.
Great price and quick delivery. Will order again in a few months.
Save BIG versus going to Samsung's website......
very good product.
It fit and was cheaper than the store
Exactly what we needed.
"We purchased our Samsung Refrigerator(RFG298HDRS) in 2013.  When I entered the model number, it says it fits our fridge but it doesn't.After calling Samsung, parts manufacturer, etc., it sounds like they changed the water filter nozzle size.  This one has the ""bigger"" nozzle and ours need the ""smaller"" nozzle.  Not sure where to get the smaller nozzle size for our fridge."
I've ordered tis product 3 times already and it works great.
Great product; quick shipment!
Came quickly.  Fits and works great.  Would definetly reccommend this filter and company for replacement filters.  Will be purchasing more filters from them when needed.
Don't really have a choice... but water doesn't taste as great nonetheless. Not undrinkable though.
Good price with easy to install instructions.  Works as designed -perfectly.  I am actually going online to order another one
Good
Great filter for our refrigerator.
I had hard time to order it from Samsung for some reason. Thanks Amazon for having it.
Cheaper than Lowes/HomeDepot. Only use Samsung replacements filters. Quality.
Just like the first time I used my refrigerator
Is what it is.
Best price for the name brand product.  I get tired of being gouged for up keep and maintenance on appliances.
"The Samsung water filter was as advertised.  Packing was just right, Installation was easy and it works great. * *"
Fits perfect!
Package of two and one did not work. Need to request a replacement. I did a google search and someone suggested that although these appear to be original Samsung they are made for Samsung in China and not only problematic but can damage the refrigerator. The post showed differing model numbers to demonstrate which were made in China. Not certain if relevant but worth looking into with Samsung.UPDATE - I was sent another 2 pack and neither item worked.
Works good
Multi pack is the way to go. These filters aren't cheap no matter where you get them. The 3 pack brings the product cost down.
This filter exceeded the standard filter recommended by the manufacturer
Good
Fits my Samsung side by side fridge for half the price of local stores. Great!
"I see the price of one filter listed at $30, why would I buy a 2-pack for $89 ?? Is there anything superior or magical that will make the water taste better if I purchased a 2-pack ?"
"Works great, exactly the same as the filter that came with my fridge when I purchased it."
It's harder to install than the original filter. And leaks a little.
Water is fantastic now that I have a new filter in ace.  I recommend this filter over your standard tap water!!
"Quick delivery, works great"
work with Samsung refregerator
Easy to install. Works as advertised.
Excellent OEM product and good price.
Works fine and great price compared to the Big Box Stores.
Works great
Works perfect
Perfect fit OEM. Fast delivery.
"This filter snapped right in and worked perfectly, no water leakage as other filters people say they do.  Will buy again."
works great just cost a lot
Works great in my new samsung fridge.
It's a fridge filter.  It works.
"When we bought this refrigerator last October it came with a filter and that one lasted about six months.  Since then we had to order more, obviously, and the first one we installed only lasted about one month.  I contacted the company and they happily sent another one in it's place. Well to our surprise this one lasted only about one month as well. So now I'm not sure what to do.  I don't know that I would have purchased this refrigerator had I known the rather expensive filter would have to be changed every month or so."
Direct replacement for OEM filter.  Will order again.
Works very well and is what is required. for the running of the Samsung RefrigeratorEasy to install every six months
Perfect fit and works well.
good value and water taste great
"These are NOT the real filters. These are VERY VERY VERY cheap knock offs.  They do not completely seal letting air into the line and making a mess when you use the water.  Also since there is not a tight seal, water will drip from your fridge making yet another mess for you. PLEASE only buy the real filters from a legit brick and mortar store.  I knew something was up when the packaging and the filter did not look like all the other ones I have had over the years."
Works good.
Orginal
Genuine samsung water filter that fits my Samsung refrigerator at a very good price with fast delivery. Nothing else to say. Highly recommend.
Works as expected and very easy to replace.
Works great. Took out well water smell .wish I would have ordered more.
great price. I can only use this filter in my refrigerator. I will buy again when needed thanks for everything
Order filled quickly. Was exactly what I ordered and was installed with ease.
"Updated review: I followed directions explicitly July 11th, and reset the filter notification on the fridge. July 18th the replace filter notification popped up! I gave it another chance and reset the filter. The replace filter filter popped up again July 20th. These are being returned."
"it only lasted about 4 months,and its for one person household..."
Best price we could find fast delivery
So far it good just hope it lasts longer than my first one
"Not the same quality as in the past.  One of the two had a really slow water flow after a few days.  The second of two seems to be okay so far.  So I really paid $84 for one filter. Ugh! Next time I'm going to my local appliance store, or just ordering directly from Samsung.I was concerned with all the negative reviews. I guess they were correct."
No problems with the filter.  Loved Amazons same day delivery.
Met my expectations.
I am happy with this purchase will buy again cheaper than home Depot or Lowe's.
It works as advertised
Love the 2 pack.  Buy it once a year and replace every 6 months or so.
Will buy again and again
Thank you amazon for your great deal: 2 for the price of 1! Now water tastes amazing...my wife is happy
Great product have been purchasing this filter for a while now. Works great and keeps our water clean easy to use.
Perfect!  Quick shipment!
A bit pricey
"This filter is an exact replacement for my refrigerator, fast ship and easy to install."
Great will order more
Was the right model number for our fridge.
Exactly what we were looking for :)
"Perfect fit for our Samsung refrigerator. Good price, quick shipping!"
Good...... but expensive.
WORKS GOOD
Its a water filter. It works like a water filter should. It filters my water.
Works just as good as more expensive brands.
best value
"Works like it should, but WAY too expensive!!!"
It was the required filter to fit in my refrigerator.  Installation was easy and filer fi with out any problems.
Good deal if you can afford to buy in quanitity. This gets you a good price without having to buy an off brand.
Great shipping great product.
"The accessory for the product. It works well, I'm happy with it's performance. Well worth the money. Samsung at it's best."
Great fit...was very easy to replace.
Everything about this product worked correctly and fit. We had very little water leak while doing install.
Price could be lower.
"Can't believe Amazon allows the sale of fake counterfeit products as real. Do not buy this. Buy from a local store. Waste of time and money.Water tastes bad, gave mother heartburn and acid reflex when drinking it. Put in clear glass and see millions of particles floating. Even emptied 10 gallons to be sure the filter is non working ! Then tried again. Please don't risk your health. Not worth it."
Tried 3 party filters and they did not work.This Samsung filter worked perfectly and would highly recommend it.Excellent product.
"This filter was great, just what I expected, and at a great cost. I was very pleased with this product."
expensive but necessary
It's a filter. It filters the water from the dispenser in the fridge. It works!
"Terrible taste, even left it in for a solid month thinking it would get better... My kids would not drink the water from my fridge nor my wife.  They even did not want to use the ice.  Save yourself the hassle and money and buy a different brand.  I hate to waste money and throw out the samsungs i just bought for new ones, but what's the point of having a fridge with a water dispenser if no one will drink the water."
We received this filter very quickly.  We recently installed it and it's working perfectly.
Excelente
reorder.
It fits and works and is $15 less than the local appliance guy.
"no complains, work as is suppose to and arrived quick :-)"
Great Filter and best price on amazon
"So far it,s working good"
It went in the fridge.  Seems to be working ok.
"This fit my Samsung refrigerator and was a good price, easy to install."
I have soft water for the whole house so they last longer than the specified time.
Perfect! and less than buying at bestbuy!!
