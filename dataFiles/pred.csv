"I was riding my electric skateboard in BC when I was struck from behind by a car. However, I did receive a sprained ankle, bruised hip and various cuts and bruises. I was unable to work as I was on crutches and was therefore off work for 3 weeks. My board was also almost completely destroyed. ",1
"I used one everyday and would say it not safe on roads if u havent been skating for years already. Learn which roads are smooth enough for skating, use bike lanes when available, and be an extremely defensive skater on the road. Ive been almost hit many times by clueless drivers and people who dont use blinkers. Get that stuff sorted out and electric skateboards are extremely convenient. Bombing down hearst is def one of my favs.",0
"In a few days later got into a pretty bad accident. Stayed at the hospital for a few days and had to buy a new helmet since the other one cracked, but if she hadn't been wearing it she would be either dead or in a coma.",1
"She used to ride her bike to work every day without a helmet, until one day a coworker said something about it being ridiculous. She started wearing a helmet out of embarrassment.",0
"The problem is, just like with any injury, it can and mostly likely will come back to haunt you many years later. I skateboarded for 15+ years and my ankles seemed indestructible... yet now I can barely walk without them catching or hurting in some way. Also, I hit my head pretty hard on a few occasions and didn’t seem to have any issues. But now every time I shower I have to jerk off three times or I get moody.",1
 started snowboarding when I was in 2nd grade and when I was in 7th grade I over rotated a 360 and caught my back edge and shit whipped my head backwards straight into solid ice and got a huge sub dermal hematoma. After that I wore a helmet religiously. Thankfully I had no lasting issues but it was crazy.,1
"I hit the side of my head so hard when i went down the entire opposite side of my body went numb. I can't remember Jack shit, I can't picture peoples faces, and on that side of my body my limbs don't move in fluid motion anymore in a downwards motion - they sort of stutter step the whole way down. So many deaths or disabilities could be prevented.",1
"I randomly decided to put my helmet on before one of my runs. I went around a turn going as fast as i could but, i forgot to put my kickstand up so, it got caught on the ground and caused me to crash. I hit the ground so hard that it cracked my helmet. I was fine other than some cuts on my arm and leg. The helmet saved my life that day.",1
I've fallen 3 times from my electric skateboard (always wearing a helmet). If you don't have gloves you should look into those as well. I didn't have them the first time and it's taking 3 weeks to heal my palms which will be scarred permanently.,1
So sad. One of my brother’s neighbors was riding her bike on her block hit a curb wrong and hit her head. She wasn’t doing anything fancy and just by her house. She left behind three young children and a husband.,1
"The thing that really convinced me is the video of that ""I fucking love helmets"" dude falling off a long board and slapping the back of his head on the ground. His brains would have been leaking out otherwise.",1
"A family friend of mine fell riding a motorized skateboard. He had chosen not to wear his helmet because he was just going a few streets down to his sisters house. His wheel his a rock and he fell hitting his head. His brain swelled, he was put into a coma. He died not long after. He was 27 year old and left behind a wife and two young children. RIP Tim Stewart.",1
Agreed and I hope Op knows to be extra careful for a few weeks since repeat concussions are a danger. Or so my doc just told me after crashing. He said it’s the coordination and cognition being off after a concussion that makes it easy to get another.,1
"About 10-ish years ago he was called to an incident in a local town where a 7 year old girl got hit by a car (on her bike) and launched about 50ft down the road. Head into a curb. They rushed to the scene, and got her to the hospital. It was still very gruesome but the only thing that saved her from destroying her head, and killing her was the helmet. The helmet was completely split in half.",1
"Brain damage is lifelong, death is forever Wear a good damn helmet. I don't understand people who ride bicycles, skateboard, drive motorcycles and scooters and don't wear them. Like, imagine yourself running into a wall at home, running around the house and you hit your head on a corner wall at 5 mph on wood. Shit hurts right, might even cut you. Now imagine doing just 30, falling off and slamming your head on the asphalt or concrete and flipping over, bouncing around or sliding and having your flesh ripped away. ATGATT, no one is invincible. I'm glad this is wellthatsucks instead of holdmyfeedingtube.",1
"I was in a bad 4 wheeler accident (different vehicle, but the lesson is the same, I think) and I wasn’t wearing a helmet. Ten days later, I woke up from my coma with no memory of the day of the accident, and no idea what was going on. A month and a half later I was still relearning how to walk and swallow (weird, but true). Months and months later I was still dealing with mood shifts that I couldn’t control. Years later, my research has told me that I will be more susceptible to Alzheimer’s and mental deterioration with old age. I wish you a speedy recovery and no more cool stories about wrecks or funny pictures of your face because of wrecks.",1
" Be safe next time man, had a friend crash while bombing a hill. Hit his head on the curb and went into a coma before passing away a few weeks later.",1
"I saw my friend try to skid once, without a helmet. He fell forward on his head/face and started seizures. After a day in the hospital we made a pact to alway wear helmets.",1
"Electric Scooters and skateboards too. I almost got in a bad crash on the Hornby bike lane this week when a dude on an e-skateboard blew by me, then suddenly slammed his brakes on and cut a sharp turn onto a side street right across my path. He and I are both lucky that I have good brakes.",1
ACL / meniscus surgery about 3 years ago after hard fall from OneWheel electric skateboard. Was up and active in normal recovery time through PT that started immediately after surgery. ,1
"excellent for beginners. the board is sturdy but the wood does feel a little soft, mildly pliable. however, it rides excellent with no issues. wheels are small and great for beginner speed. the only negative thing is that the advertised image shows no label marking on the black track pad but actual board has white logo on top. see image. not a deal breaker. my year old daughter loves it.",0
i bought both my daughters the e electric scooter and they love them! they are easy to charge so the girls are able to do it themselves.this product is not meant for long rides or big hills. this scooter last between and miles then needs to be recharged. it is great just to ride around the neighborhood to see friends.great product,0
picked this out online with my year old son for his first skateboard. he was looking at several different models in the same price range. the reviews actually led us to choose this one over the others. we did have to loosen the wheels just a tiny bit so it would roll easier but that's no big deal an kind of expected. quality seems good and his friends that are more experienced on skate boards actually really liked it. good bang for your buck here.,0
"The backstory: the child’s grandmother had went out that day and bought her a new bicycle, and helmet too. They took it home, and the girl was very excited to get it out and use it. So they went out for a drive. They got downtown and this incident happened.",0

"the suspension on this board is non-existent, so every bump and dip you go over is transferred directly into your ankles and wrists. my wrists feel sore after a couple of miles.the top speed is too slow to ride on anything but neighborhood streets, so if there are no bike lanes where you ride, expect to feel like a road hazard as cars constantly overtake you.everything besides the top speed and suspension is fine.",0
came slightly damaged with scuff marks in several places. the functionality wasn't affected but it makes the product look used rather than new. i contacted the manufacturer and was not given a replacement but a refund. this was slightly disappointing since i am giving the board away as a gift with scratches in the wood it's definitely a super nice board and well made but it would have been nicer undamaged.,0
"I was riding on the side of the road, straddling the shoulder line. I heard the car approaching from behind and expected her to go around, but she struck me with the right front corner of her car, knocking me off my board onto the road. Thankfully, I rolled to the right and did not go underneath the vehicle.",0
