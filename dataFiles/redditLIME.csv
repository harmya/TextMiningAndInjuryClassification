visiting the psychiatric ward for being sad turns out my brain is turning to mush from an old skateboard accident ten years ago oops wear a helmet kids 
the iconic tomar beard is actually there to cover up his horrific scarring
i was expecting him to make a miraculous recovery
brittle boned bitch
 and i don t remember having any kind of existential visions or having any kind of consciousness at any point i don t know what the people here are talking about no lights no life flashbacks none of that hell i don t even remember the accident itself all i know from the accident is what people tell me 
take my god damn upvote
i m side eyeing you 
girl if he doesn t use a helmet don t expect him to use a condom
talk to a personal injury lawyer 
if your bones truly belong here you d know that you needn t be scared brother god speed on your healing if your bones are in tact

i don t think the scooters are too bad given how they have breaks the skateboards from what i can tell don t really have breaks i personally drive a small scooter around campus going around mph because no one needs to be going on campus but i always wear a helmet and i ve never hit or had a close call with someone ever i ve been hurt more by other scooter riders as a pedestrian i always see people wiping out or hurting others with electric skateboards i ll bet they ll get banned soon people always wear their damn headphones airpods too pedestrians included so no one hears a goddamn thing until it s too late i ve had scooter skateboard riders completely cut me off while i m walking and i m amazed at how they just don t seem to care or don t even realize it 
tech decks
hope all goes well you weak boned fool
face in the sliding door he s telling you about his skateboarding accident
sonic has died in a tragic skateboarding accident watch the leaked footage here 
unfortunately people not wearing a helmet is going to bring a bad name to eboarding this is a very unfortunate example of that r i p noah
haha this was great i love the last bit about wanting lungs to smoke pot with 
got the glenn look going on 
plz just hear me out
oh yeah please stay safe wear your helmet and follow safety guidelines 
no andrias is cause he stabbed marcy at the speed of sound
test it with a barcode scanner 
it s not just skateboarding rollerblading electric skateboarding longboarding even biking to a lesser degree all have an image problem with the helmet and safety gear it s really hard to convince people to wear their safety gear if they ve never had a crash and or none of their peers wear safety gear now once you ve had a crash or there s been a crash in your riding group everyone realizes that it could happen to them and they need to take this shit seriously i had never had a crash of any significance but i ve read the horror stories and had people around me that encouraged the wearing of helmets rather than made fun of me as a kid and even though i hadn t had any serious falls any skateboarder will tell you that falling is part of the sport you re going to fall and i ve had many falls that start to make you realize how quickly something bad can happen luckily for me i was wearing a helmet the day that i got speed wobbles at about mph earlier this year there is no doubt in my mind that my helmet either saved my life or saved me from a serious brain injury i was thrown forward and my head ended up snapping back with the back of the helmet hitting the ground i really shudder to think of where i would be today if anywhere if i hadn t been wearing a helmet as it was i almost certainly had a concussion and was in a fog for the next hours i bought an even better helmet afterward but hung on to my lifesaver and will never ride anything without a helmet i wish i could somehow convey this feeling to kids to make them understand the risk they are taking for vanity fuck that this is your life 
thank you this would be awesome
just go on james twitch page click on clips popular hours scroll down and you ll find it

christians and the united states president do it everyday why can t i 
mostly only because of heavy interference or damage to the remote or esc it s rare but we hear so much about them because when it happens everybody posts it here nobody comes to this sub to post his remote works flawlessly depends when it happens and what does your board do when it happens some boards keep rolling some start braking slowly and some jam the brakes a looking at you evolve i would say like

oh and if you re into this kind of thing there s an old battleship nearby turned into a museum you can walk through the whole thing see the med bay cafeteria barracks etc they have preserved personal affects from soldiers etc possibly haunted it s set up just like it was back in the s and it s extremely cool 
very sad from the description of the accident it really does sound like a helmet could ve been the difference between a really bad crash you walk off and dying 
agreed let s regulate the hell out of esk d and e scooters because person died meanwhile how many people died by car and do they talk about it 
he was taken to the icu at grady hospital in georgia and was determined to have brain swelling three hematoma s and a skull with of it fractured he was prepared for brain surgery to reduce the swelling however one doctor suggested pumping his body with sodium so the doctors did just that the brain swelling went down and he avoided the brain surgery he did however have to stay in the icu for about more days for rehydration after that was complete he went through rehab at the shepherd center in atlanta before being released into the world again 
this is unbelievably heartbreaking so so sad for michelle and her family

nba okongwu and the eternal memory of his brother who died in a skateboard accident
getting older all the time
does anyone know about this movie or the actual events if any 
if you re a skater you worry a lot less about these things got a discord setup btw that s kind of begginer focused and more about just cruising and exploring if you re interested but yeah little real skill and some techniques to slow yourself down and you ll be better prepared to deal with it it s rare but not unheard of i ve had my power button wiggle itself off on rough ground a couple times which amounts to the same thing 
say my mother should have aborted you then abort him

do not buy a meepo board they have terrible quality the board randomly shut off one day as i was spiraling into traffic expecting to be able to break 
i m no doctor but i reckon wind resistance from the hairy legs was probably the real culprit here 
be prepared to pay if you have any liability insurance or car insurance of your own you could possibly go through them as long as the deductable the amount you pay is less than the new windshield and your rates won t change i m not sure exactly how your insurance if you have it works but those are standard things to look out for if you don t go through an insurance company do your research find out from a reputable source how much the windshield should cost ask for receipts make sure the amount of money the driver is asking for is reasonable and legit if not you may want to consider getting a lawyer or going through some sort of arbiter the good news is that the cost shouldn t be impossible to cover for a regular car i d expect euro to be a high end estimate based on a quick google that gave me info from the usa so maybe a bit higher depending on tax it s a common thing and the service shouldn t be a premium charge

wow holy shit that skateboard impregnated her she s going to have little skateboard babies
i had a very similar accident where i hit the back of my head on the floor and lost my sense of smell i am still healing months later with no sense of smell i damaged the nerves in the process i definitely recommend seeing a specialist like i did he she can read mri data and give you some info they normally tell me that you can lose your sense of smell like this for about a year beyond that is normally permanent but don t take my word for it see a specialist
sigh

i sprained my wrist in a skateboard accident my wrist still hurts weeks later because i have to work in the back of kitchen
nal but in most countries i d say yes it s your fault it was your skateboard that fell into the street and by the story i ve understood that it could ve easily killed someone it is your responsibility to not let your skateboard get away in the middle of a busy street as far as money goes you ll most likely have to pay for the repair of the windshield since it was your fault but since you were nice and did the right thing giving the driver your contact info he might try to see if his insurance pays for the repair being a taxi driver it s very likely but i would not recommend rely on this wait until he contacts you and everything will be fine 
oh trust me i will as soon as he wakes up from surgery how utterly weak and embarrassing to be related to this deformity
this in early february i wiped out on my electric scooter still not sure how i think the throttle got stuck and i swerved to not run into someone who walked into the middle of the street in front of me and i was so lucky i was wearing a helmet even though i was only going blocks i almost didn t wear it even with the helmet i had a decent sized goose egg on my forehead which did bleed a little and my glasses were smashed upon impact but it s nothing in comparison to how bad it could ve been without the helmet yes please always wear a helmet people even if you re just going down the street 
i m the mom whose yr old had the skateboarding accident i have some good news to share 
do frogs have genitals
title i was going down a huge slope really really fast when i lost control and fell i rolled forward on the harsh concrete scraping my back arm and piercing the skin on my hand 
so i m not great with money i make bad decisions i buy expensive audio and recording equipment that i probably shouldn t own i wasn t in debt but i had myself set up for disaster i have a car payment rent another between phone and insurance at least another in misc subscriptions and bills from sweetwater and about months ago i decided to finance a new martin d that s about a month i make about k a month after taxes so i was already stretched thin but i always pay all of my bills and keep my credit cards paid off 
i d say just take it slow but keep skating as much as possible how d you do it anyway

hello everyone i m writing here because i have no idea what to do
it was a new electric skateboard i bought so my fleecy legs stood no chance
on may th i was riding my electric skateboard in bc when i was struck from behind by a car i was riding on the side of the road straddling the shoulder line i heard the car approaching from behind and expected her to go around but she struck me with the right front corner of her car knocking me off my board onto the road thankfully i rolled to the right and did not go underneath the vehicle however i did receive a sprained ankle bruised hip and various cuts and bruises i was unable to work as i was on crutches and was therefore off work for weeks my board was also almost completely destroyed there was no damage to her vehicle i would like to pursue retribution in the form of lost wages and compensation for my property my question is this how should i go about this as e boards are illegal in bc but it is likely she was distracted driving

this is absolutely awful i hope she s gonna get better 
not everyone experiences it some people maybe you included might not remember it if you look at nderf studies i believe the number is something like of rosc patients that experience nde just because you don t experience it doesn t discredit the s of others who have 
so i m sure you guys get these similar stories about hardship credit cards and loans i am not here for pity or for a lecture about how horrible i am with money i just have a handful of questions that are too specific to find answers without calling some places or asking here thanks sorry this ended up being very long you can skip to the end for my question if your actually interested in giving me some advice which i greatly appreciate 
sure and then they want to make it even more illegal come on they should ban alcohol or driving all together 
 don t drink and ride don t get high and ride use safety gear at minimum a helmet just in case anyone hasn t caught on yet this hobby is fun but it s also extremely dangerous especially beyond mph probably preaching to the choir but people still need to hear this 
thanks for sharing 
i m responsible for transportation but thanks to the nd job i had taken on a couple of months ago i have the money for plane tickets and a rental car and some spending money as well

yeah it was pretty scary did she see what happened i remember it but it s be interesting to get another perspective on it 
 sit down and call me mike i obliged sitting on the only actual chair in the room the figure sitting across from me was covered head to toe wearing a long sleeve flannel shirt and gloves and a strange plastic mask that covered his entire face a towel was also wrapped around his head and neck and he lounged comfortably in a bean bag chair i discreetly tried to see if there was any exposed skin but i saw none uh yes mr i mean mike so anyways as i said i m a reporter from vice news and i was hoping that we could discuss your company and your role in its astonishing rise mike laughed of course of course we can talk about that if you really want to but be straight with me you re really here to see if you can do what everyone else has failed to do and learn something anything about me for sure i ve seen the buzzfeed articles some of you journalists have quite the imagination elon musk s secret twin brother really i smiled a bit nervously well of course if you have anything to say about yourself i d be thrilled but considering how closely you ve guarded your privacy so far i doubt it so i m happy to interview you about your business then try and analyze every word you said for tiny clues so that my less serious colleagues can write clickbait articles about you mike laughed again his frequent laughter was throwing me off i had assumed that he would be a serious man based on his privacy and how closely he must have managed his business to achieve the gains he had seen in the past few years well i appreciate the honesty and sorry what was your name jake alright jake i like your style so i ll answer some questions for you what do you want to know well what do you attribute your success to pure dumb luck i blinked in surprise luck completely i started my company to start making various apps to improve people s lives i m fascinated by technology you know especially how big a part of everything the internet has become i mean imagine if you took this technology back even a few decades in time and tried to explain an iphone to some kid from the s not just how it was real and not science fiction but also how you use it in your day to day life it s amazing i think a lot of people take these things for granted but anyways i m off topic i started my company and immediately some guy that i d never heard of asked to come and work for me and it turned out he was one of the brightest software developers of our time and left his six figure job just to work for pennies under me and when word got out more followed especially after one of my competitors unexpectedly shut down almost their entire staff came to work here in a year i went from self employed to owning a company of over employees and i stayed lucky apple decided to start featuring dozens of our apps in their app store and google did the same in the play store on some of them like drivesafe we averaged million downloads a day in the first months after release mike leaned forward in his bean bag chair pure dumb luck all of it but anyways enough business what kind of music do you like uh anything i suppose i was taken aback by the abrupt change of topic bullshit you like mainstream stuff but i guarantee that i could put on half a dozen songs that you d hate with a passion have you ever listened to endless nameless can t say i know it exactly because unless you love grunge it sounds like trash here i ll play it for you mike said this as he stood but stumbled over the bean bag chair he had been sitting in and tripped to the ground as he turned i froze in surprise and i couldn t help but stare mike s plastic mask and towel had fallen off as he tripped and looking back at me was not the face of a man with a severe skin disease as was the popular theory for his refusal to show his face but the empty eye sockets of a skull what the fu shut up shut the fuck up calm down hearing normal speech come from the up and down movement of an exposed jawbone did not calm me down and i began to hyperventilate i tried to stand but my legs were shaking and i fell back into my seat god damnit god fucking damnit alright fuck calm down and i ll explain i guess i have to i d really prefer you didn t publish this not that anyone would believe you but i really don t want people looking into my past more than they already do i was still frozen in my seat well basically i m what you d call a lich or at least that s the dungeons and dragons word for it and i haven t heard a better one i was born in and when i was a teenager i got into the occult i was fucking around it was all a joke really but one day i found a spell for immortality my friends and i all did it nothing happened we laughed about it and joked we couldn t be killed but the next day i was rereading it and something caught my eye whoever had written the thing had written something into the decorative margins i realized it looked familiar because they wrote it in the elvish that tolkien uses in lord of the rings yeah i m a fucking nerd i know and it was sindarin before you ask not that you probably know what that is but the last guy to have the book was just as much of a nerd and left a message for the next nerd who found it and it was a few modifications to the ingredients and the spell i did it out of curiosity and the symbols i drew on my basement floor glowed then faded and then nothing i didn t think anything had changed and decided the glowing must have been my imagination about four or five years later i was skateboarding tried a stunt i wasn t good enough for and broke my neck dead on impact then suddenly i wake up in the dark i realize i m in a box manage to break it open and claw my way through a few feet of dirt to the surface then i saw what i looked like i was a fucking skeleton i hid and realized that it wasn t anymore it was i had been dead for years but i still had no idea what was going on and why i was now a living skeleton but i did feel a tugging i followed it moving only at night until i found myself at a landfill and then to one specific trash bag in it was a lot of my parents old stuff including that vhs tape he pointed to one on a shelf it was a recording of saved by the bell but when i held it i felt complete so i took it also though i didn t give it any mind at the time there was a dead half crushed rat what does the rat have to do with anything just listen okay so i made myself a disguise of sorts with clothing a ski mask gloves and some shades that i found at the landfill i went back to the old public library broke in at night and found that occult book still exactly where it had been back in my day i read the next page after the spell and found more elvish that i should have seen and translated apparently the immortality was by binding my soul to a vessel and since i hadn t used one it had latched onto something random nearby the tape of saved by the bell i also hadn t completed the ritual i needed to kill an animal and spill its blood on the vessel to make it complete when that dead rat touched the tape it completed the ritual and my body reawakened in the graveyard near as i can figure my hoarder of a mother hadn t wanted to throw away her precious vhs collection until recently and my dad probably threw a dead rat from a trap in the trash bag before taking it out that s quite a story i may as well tell you the rest of it i was lying during the interview it wasn t luck that built my company as a lich apparently i possess a number of magical abilities especially with the aid of my book there is a lot of hidden writing in the margins written mostly in elvish and klingon that makes the spells work that s how i built this company magic lots of magic all so that i can lounge around listen to nirvana and wish that i still had lungs to smoke some pot with mike sat back down in his bean bag chair so any questions

disgusting beast try not to trip and shatter your skeleton on the way out you heathen 
so annoyed that ontario as a province doesn t have a law about wearing helmets i see people riding in downtown toronto w o a helmet alllll the time i also see giant trucks not shoulder checking allll the time 
fuck that genuinely made me laugh 
oh man this is so sad i will keep her daughter in my thoughts 
why are they putting tile under tables 
ok i know this sounds weird but when i was quite young i watched a tv movie about the beach boys at some point in the film there was a scene were one of them was being dragged behind a car on a skate board and was hit by an oncoming car this member too long ago to remember which one but i always assumed it was brian was left a bit brain damaged but years later recovered enough to fight be able to play a concert again

jessica taylor is she dead or alive after the skateboard accident biography age news
i have seen several times that controllers lose connection and cause an accident i have questions 
 you are hereby disowned 
haha halfpipe never forget 
could have been a full disconnect from the board and not just a momentary disconnect you could possibly try this by spinning up the motors with the board upside down and powering off the remote or making it lose signal for an extended period of time to see if thats what caused it to lock up 
guys please always wear a helmet i usually never wore a helmet because i have an unusually large head and its impossible to fit in a helmet even the xxxl sizes were too small i was lucky to find one last week and i just took a nasty fall backwards on my board and hit my head hard on the pavement thank god for this helmet
heyyyyyy i grew up around there if you guys like aquariums the fort fisher one is close to there and is really fun check to see if they are open regular hours though covid if you guys like burritos you have to drive up to wilmington like min and go to flaming amy s burrito barn they are my favorite place to eat ever when we make the trip back there every couple years i eat at flaming amy s literally every day of vacation i don t have any current information on the area haven t been back since our trip was cancelled but if you have any questions about the general area please feel free to dm me i lived there for years 
this is the most often asked question on the internet and everyone is turning to google to find out more about her know about the skateboard accident of jessica taylor
i m sorry that happened if i were you i would try to sell anything that could get me cash in order to pay off the payments w the highest interest ratings first this might mean your car and guitar but it will reduce your debt by thousands and save you hundreds every month i would also cancel any subscriptions i have netflix and spotify so that would have to go dave ramsey has a good program to help people w high cc debt called the debt snowball i recommend watching some of his youtube vids best of luck

that s a tough one confidence is such a hard thing to grasp i injured myself quote a few times too once i twisted my ankle badly after basically landing from a high jump with my board on top of my foot nearly tearing my ankles i was back on the next day despite the pain getting back on quickly is often key as you simply don t have time to mull over what happened unfortunately that ship has sailed for you not sure what to suggest other than try to push through you re the boss of your body if you tell it to go it ll go mind over matter take it slow just step on and maybe let it roll down a gentle decline getting the feeling back in your body it ll pass bro

so all three of my cards are stupid high interest apr the minimum payments plus interest is too much for me to handle right now after a few months of getting paid i can get back to being ok but its going to take me selling some gear and eating cheap i already have listed a few expensive items on reverb i was looking into consolidating the options on kreditkarma are a fucking joke my credit score being so low is probably the reason the options are all like apr and my car as collateral i don t know who would actually fall for that my question finally sorry is is there a better place i could go and say get a k lower interest loan with my car as collateral i would assume putting my car up would drop the interest down to a reasonable is that ignorant of me i know nothing about finances obviously also if that is a possibility do you think it would be a good idea considering my circumstances i just hate paying hundreds of dollars to these companies for basically nothing in an ideal situation i could get a k loan with low interest and pay it off in a year or two and avoid all of these damn interest charges every month they are really crippling my progress i also do not want to have to sell my beloved guitars and gear but i am willing to do that if necessary i just would lose a lot and end up never being able to replace the guitars the two i have were k back before all of the online taxes and wood importing fees in todays market they would be closer to k but it would take me years to sell them at a similar price which i don t want to do they are my favorite things in the world also i tried returning the d that i bought a month before my accident and they were not having it because in my crippled state i accidentally knocked a heavy item into it cosmetically damaging it it was a bad fucking month 
 i dunno i guess i would go to the hospital no you cant all the hospitals are closed 
just start from square push around feel the board under your feet it s hard to get injured when you re just going for a cruise when you re good with that start trying some of your favorite tricks again low risk low effort ones like shoves is a great place to start
so i was trying to hit this gnarly kickflip dude board fell out from under me i landed badly and got this cool scar man

agreed very hard to say but it does happen yrs riding evolve bgtr and i ve had disconnects no wheels locking just the jolt and free roll in the same spot near my home i think from braking with battery i now run it down to ish no disconnects anymore 
iirc he hurt himself again skateboarding and the band missed playing snl so management put a no skateboarding clause in the contract 
 that s what you said last time but this time i mean it 
here s the video link 
i havent had a disconnect yet k miles on my wowgo x had a backfire exway and meepo before this no issues 
if you enjoy gender change

how stupid rider stupid attitude will impact by new shit laws all people s who ride carefully and geared with protection the guy is a dad with children and he didn t know it s dangerous with alcohol and no helmet on his board his wife statement is clearly childish and stupid it hurts to have her husband their dad in the tomb it s heartbreaking but don t reject the fault on the law it s common sense 
in august i had gotten back into skateboarding after a few year hiatus i m it was a great way to exercise for me then one day just cruising i managed to fuck up really bad i fell and somehow shattered my pelvis and broke my acetabulum i had to get a major surgery and they had to basically screw me back together yay

 sports tigers minor leaguer chace numata dies from skateboard accident
the nutcracker
no one can answer this question as no board is the same i could tell you my diy has not disconnected after miles but it means nothing to you also it really depends on how the esc is configured to operate during a disconnect you can have it set to default to full brake for example imagine that while you re going mph not all boards operate the same in these scenarios and not all boards are built with the same electronics
i remember reading in the puppets book that the first show where james was back on guitar after this was the last show cliff ever played
bro i see people mobbin thinking there so cool without a helmet and every time i think just wait g your time will come lmao everybody crashes don t matter how good of a skater you think you are it s bound to happen pad up helmet up so what if it looks like your going into battle lmao just roll with it 
 so sad rip noah his friend posted this on social media yesterday evening my friend went out for a short ride on his meepo mini he didn t have a helmet on i wasn t there but he was going fast and got speed wobbles he fell off at around mph and landed directly on his head his skull cracked completely open and was rushed to the near by hospital where he was in surgery for about hours he suffered a major injury to his brain stem and unfortunately didn t make it through the night wear your helmets boys and girls it s not worth the risk 
seeing the doctor soon skateboard accident toes are swollen i m scared for the results 
no amount of surgery will fix his weakness might as well accept the l
brains are both incredibly durable and incredibly fragile it can be easy to damage it in the long term from simple trauma recreational drug and alcohol use and even just localization environmental polution like heavy metals
sad that a man lost his life but why is the coroner writing to transport etc about it the man wasn t wearing a helmet and was drunk sadly his own neglect contributed to loss of life not because of the electric skateboard 
lmao ruthless 
whoops not google
thanks probably young me thought i was watching a movie about the beach boys 
i hope she s ok i was at those warsaw shows and have that shirt but not in those sizes good luck 
right i tried explaining it to my friends and family and they looked at me like i was crazy lol
omg i just got an ebike and i hope so much for that feeling of excitement and thrill i just hope not to fall in front of a truck ya know 
note to self don t go past mph while drunk and wearing no safety gear 
lol no i wont become an adrenaline junkie typically i get my adrenaline from playing sports and that s just enough for me but because of covid i haven t gotten the chance to play pickup or for a team 
how likely are you able to recover from a disconnect to prevent an accident 
james laugh is the thing i missed the most once he left cow chop it s so contagious yet bully ish great they are joking about cc now 
 
james sings with broken hand due the skateboarding accident summer 
a man without a helmet died in an electric skateboard accident
my diy uses a mini rc transmitter and receiver and upon loss of connection my board goes full throttle you can set the failsafe on that controller most set it to neutral 
 fuck you 
whoever gave this the wholesome award you must have no feelings
is he though he has the same pathetic genes he has just been wrapped in bubble wrap his whole life 
you ve unlocked vitiligo
what happened to your sister that put her in a coma it s amazing she recovered but it seems like michelle s daughter has a severe brain head injury which typically doesn t bode well 
i m so sorry you re going though this i did the same thing over years ago back of head etc still can t smell was told at the time that either the olfactory portion of my brain was damaged or the nerves that connect to the brain from the receptors in the nose were severed in either case not a good prognosis i hope you fare better i have heard stories of people getting it back 
he was out of shepherd in weeks and had his first speech physical and occupational therapy appointments a month from his release at shepherd he went in for those appointments and they told him he had no reason to need it he is still recovering but still has a long way to go with his cognitive recovery
so fatal accident in a month that is just scary 
help me out i can t seem to get this window open nevermind it s open 
your bf is dumb as fuck
my friend post scrotum crushing skateboard accident lay here for an embarrassingly long time 
since covid and lockdown i ve been living with my parents preparing to leave home after college i ve felt so so dead inside like i was just wasting away at home waiting to die it hurt so fucking much going through the motions laying in bed and doing relatively nothing all day 
funnily enough i somehow managed to hurt myself last time on a cruise
died and brought back to life in hospital from skateboard accident
i ve also been wondering what happens when you take a hill higher than the advertised incline i m guessing it does something similar to this thank you for your insight 
it just kept going 
was he caught in a mosh 
guys i figured out how sasha is going to lose her eye it will be in a skateboarding accident that s what she gets for not wearing a helmet 
this is horrifying i can t imagine how she myst be feeling right now 
mf you enjoy the gift your little sister has given you
damn this makes me wonder if my sadness is mush brain related
sorry you re dealing with this i hope it improves i lost mine after a car accident but didn t immediately realize it i did not fully lose my sense of taste but it had decreased didn t see a doctor about the loss of smell until about a year later he suggested it was due to shearing of olfactory nerves at the cribriform plate i was told there was a possibility for the nerves to regenerate and form new connections and that i may regain my smell but that if that does happen it could take years he also said if i were to regain my sense of smell it would most likely be in the first or so years and that if it had not improved in the first years it would be unlikely to ever happen i m at about years later and don t seem to have regained much if any sense of smell over time i ve actually become a bit more sensitive to some things like the taste of vinegar sometimes i think i catch whiffs of smells but if i don t have someone to check with i m never sure if it was real or not my body did compensate in one way i either developed or heightened an ability to somewhat taste the air and detect qualities in the air that i can somewhat link to odors some of this is probably linked to smelling things that trigger a response from the trigeminal nerve like vinegar alcohol menthol type things and some chemicals it is definitely not a strong ability for example i have a difficult time differentiating between eucalyptus and minty menthol products but i seem to be more sensitive than others to certain things like a musty room

scott ian was initially asked to be the rhythm guitarist until hetfield s wrist healed they ended up going with john marshall instead scott ian said he was extremely keen to do it but he had other obligations 
surely a true strongbone would not be scared for the results stay strong of bone brother 
i need my james laughs in these trying times 
so basically i had an incident where i landed on my leg twisted it nearly degrees and tore my hamstring i m starting to feel good enough to skate again and attempted to last night but i felt an incredible amount of anxiety and nausea everytime i was about to push off anyone know techniques to rebuild confidence 
consider amputation you weak boned idiot 
 world a skateboarding accident led this photographer to find his passion
the story starts when i was going down a street with my skateboard and tried to do a trick the board went into the street which is a busy street i might add it went under the wheel of an uncoming car didn t break flipped like meters in the air and fell on the window of the taxi driver made a crack about the size of a baseball glove on the passenger side he stopped in the middle of the street and i went back
had to be jan berry jan and dean even had a song about skateboarding called called sidewalk surfing
reasonably scared it turns out
if your hamstring is telling you to stop then stop if anxiety is telling you to stop then get back on that board take baby steps to rebuild that confidence if you don t get back on it now it s going to get harder and harder to get back on it down the line first thing i do if i fall on a trick if i haven t seriously hurt myself is try the exact same trick again 
that s complete destruction 
first of all my thanks once again for all the love and support i received here it helped so much to know so many people were thinking of us she has improved and is doing really well she is still having headaches but they re much less intense she gets overwhelmed from sensory input more easily but this is normal plus she has always been easily overstimulated as a baby i knew i had minutes in any store before we had to be out of there lol 
didn t they have to bail on snl over this too 
yes right in two
you should meditate it might help you remember
did you see what happened by chance 
spell his fucking name right mccosky ya hack

how dare you rosa diaz i am your superior officer
landed on my left wrist to brace my fall now it hurts when i turn it i m thinking it will never heal because i work in a kitchen at a restaurant should i take a month off or continue to work
yup i bet aleks was laughing his ass off too shame he wasn t streaming at the time
i saw the post where you were thanking someone for sending the new shirt glad to see she seems to be doing better i hope she gets back on the board and continues to shred 
it s spelled correctly
i got into a bad skateboarding accident maybe weeks ago and now feel incredibly nervous when on my board
fukin legend
very underrated comment
i feel sick for michelle and her family prayers sent above 
o dear god come to her aid and bring healing and comfort 
basically my foot caught in the wheel as i was pushing myself forward and kinda got stuck on the floor my board kept going pulling my other leg as it went this forced me into a split and then i lost my balance fell and twisted my left leg nearly degrees 
that friend posted that on this sub yesterday or the day before sucks 
u savevideobot

oh no hope she s okay 
congratulations like billions of people before you you scraped your leg
this happened almost a year ago btw
yeah i m kinda scared now when i was i nearly cracked my head open from falling down concrete stairs and i go through periods when i feel really depressed 
i would have given it i haven t smiled all day until this 
i have a lot of hope that aleks and james will remedy their friendship sometime in the future unless that friendship is already fixed that we re unaware of a lot of the creatures still talk to each other occasionally after years of them disbanding and some like ze and gassy even stream do yt videos together if the beauty gurus of yt can start drama about each other stop being friends then eventually awhile after become friends again then i m sure james and aleks will we just have to wait and see 
fuck i m so sorry and sad for her what a nightmare i hope brielle can pull through 
we will find out if your a weakling
speaking as a formerly terrible skateboarder it doesn t look too bad
thanks dude he ll probably be okay eventually but it s hard to think about how much work and time and money it ll take to get him close to how he was 
welcome 
without context it looks like he is wanking 
now this doesn t sound like anything that i can see actually happened so either i ve remembered the movie being about the wrong band or they just invented it as a way to not tall about brian s mental health issues 
its a common misconception james broke his arm in a skateboarding accident but this is how it really happened 
 dont t ride a skateboard at kmh ofcourse it helps but is is dangerous even with gear tho i like to puff and ride so relaxing lol everyone knows this sub is like a helmet cirkeljerk reddit nowadays
i once got a into a serious skateboarding accident i lost all memories of the fall didn t break a bone 
f
yes and yes i was alone when i bailed the person who found me was my neighbor coming home from work he saw me unconscious in the middle of the street with a river of blood going from my head to the gutters i didn t return to complete consciousness for up to three days and in that time period i didn t even know my parent s and grandparent s names 
when is going down that slope i remembered what it feels like to have some adrenaline soar through my body feel air race across my scalp the razor thin edge between joy and fear blurring as i move faster and faster down the slope it was so refreshing even when i feel and was hurt i felt more relief than pain and it calmed me 
every guy within a mile radius
glad you re okay i totally get what you mean life has been at a standstill for a lot of people over the last year or so and the monotony has been frustrating to say the least just don t go all evel knievel and become an adrenaline junkie lol
lol i love this xd
i felt this one in my pubes

congrats i spend a couple weeks every year very close to carolina beach you re going to love it i dunno what you like to do but the shell hunting is great look for sharks teeth and you can usually find boat or jet ski tours nearby kayaking in the sound is fun since there are no waves and just enjoy the relaxation 
the debut album and some singles are on spotify the name is plumber we were about to record another ep before he got hurt 
mama mia that s a spicy meatballs 
really fucking hope he s okay man no one is talking about it like it s a small injury
may have been said but i d always make sure to ride no faster than you can traditionally skate brake ie a foot slide i ve had eboards and a couple remotes die mid transit but realistically any big name consumer board has next to no real issues in mass production and just odd issues for a single boards here and there but i can t stress enough how many injuries occur to those who have never skated normally or haven t in years and go ahead and zip off at to get stopped by a single rock or crack and break an arm 
the chromatic aberration the blur the colors i don t want to say vaporwave but this does give me a vibe 
 so here i am doing everything i can
the trip is going to be the last week in april and we ll be staying in carolina beach nc the date and place are chosen for us by the organization i ve never been to that beach or done anything besides drive through a tiny part of nc on a road trip once so i m excited to get to see a new place i don t know what our lodging will look like yet but it will be a private unit with kitchen etc my son is so dang sweet he told me he s willing to sleep on the couch if he has to so allie can have a room to herself 
that must have been one mad skateboard accident did your heart stop were you in a drug induced coma to help the swelling of your brain go down what happened 
i m sorry 
yeah but i didn t see the stairs bit coming 
v happy to hear she s recovering i have a small that i would love to send you so that you can cannibalize it into something more badass 
call his bones cringe
i thought about running for it but something stopped me i gave him my facebook and my phone and he told me he would call me tommorow and he added me as a friend today is the next day and i dont know if i have to pay for it all if his insurance will pay it is it my fault or anything of any legal matter
she saw the end of it she didn t know you got hit by a car until i showed you her your post until we saw the post we both just thought that you had fell from your skateboard i didn t really see anything by the time i saw anything you were getting into a car 
this is sickening
rektum
not even mph but even at a mild kmph mph i d say one wrong fall and you can be seriously injured as much as it ll be a we all know thing to at least ride with a helmet and all the other precautionary it s always better safe than sorry and let ppl know since there may be a grow new user base that may visit this community 
 you were adopted btw 
just gonna point out the phrase from the article took it for a ride without a helmet i hope the kid s okay but let s be real this is one of the best examples of play stupid games win stupid prizes 
wtf is that your foot has no toes and a thumb on the heal lol
anyone have experience with road rash i got into a skateboard accident going fast downhill during june any tips or advice for what to do or if it will go back to normal 
swollen toes normally means a sprain if memory serves however i may be wrong either way don t fear for the potential of weak bones strong bones must be reinforced further with an iron will 
i am strong after all
commenting to find this later to show my dumbass bf who never wears a helmet
update 
holy fuck this is just heartbreaking always wear a helmet people always i had a number of close calls like this when i was younger which led to a doctor asking me tony hawk wears a helmet are you smarter than tony hawk no i am not helmets save lives it doesn t matter if they mess up your hair or make you look un cool because it sure as hell is better than winding up brain dead or sedated in a coma teetering on the edge of death always wear a helmet and always remind others what can happen if they don t wear a helmet buy a helmet that properly fits your head snug and secure and be sure to wear it the right way sending all my hopes and prayers to brielle and michelle right now the brain is an adaptable thing that can heal from injuries like this and gary busey is living proof of that i hope that brielle will be okay and i hope more people see this post and wear a fucking helmet

it s scar tissue more than likely it ll stay with you for the next two years and if you re not lucky am i stay with you for the rest of your life but don t worry it s not going to be a life threatening i have scars from years ago that still haven t healed but they haven t caused any problems 
tap and gap she wouldn t remember to be angry or feel cheap 
or surprise vasectomy
yeah i m not a fan of the electric skateboards few years ago i watched someone eat shit on one after smacking into another student who was walking and looking at their phone also people fly as fast as they can down the paths in tempe this was inevitable 
prayers for brielle this is awful sometimes things look very bleak but miracles do happen when my sister ended up in a coma years ago we nearly lost her twice she needed to be resuscitated twice things did not look good the doctor told us she would die a priest went into her room twice to give her the final blessings she was gone basically it was horrible then she woke up and got all better all the worst case scenarios we were warned about didn t come true she got better just like that we were bracing ourselves for the worst and she pulled through with no lasting consequences never lose faith life works in mysterious ways i do believe there s something out there keeping an eye on us based on things my sister told me she saw while she was in her coma she went somewhere and came back because she knew she had to come back 
 oooh 
i think that s the wall i e below the table and the table sits atop the tile line 
these are my absolute favorite skateboarding fails to watch 
bonereee
so basically you are borrowing the value of your guitars and other gear at annual interest something like that you could largely eliminate the debt if you sell the gear but you say you don t want to that s a choice i m not quite sure how you would think you would get another loan on your car if you already have a car payment 
haven t had real teeth for a couple years now just decided one day hey i m a busy man why waste time brushing my teeth when i don t really need em stopped paying rent for a couple weeks in hopes my landlord would come knock em out but i just ended up with a broken nose ended up having to resort to the ol bowling ball suicide method now i wear dentures anchovy joe is my denture guy he s great he charges a lot and they fall apart really often and they smell like fish okay maybe he s not the greatest do you know a better denture guy if possible another guy who does fishy smelling dentures i actually like that part reminds me of my childhood 
yeah i damaged my tendons ligaments pretty painful but they re healing quickly

are your teeth intact 
my brother got in a skateboarding accident and broke his ankle in three places any messages for him before he goes in for surgery 
people are fucking dumb and just say shit for drama they are clearly not friends anymore but don t have any sort of beef or disdain for each other for the last month or so whenever they have come across each other they have interacted pretty well 
goddamn i wish these two would start a channel of just them 
i m glad you re ok too my girlfriend dropped me off to get covid tested that morning and saw you while she was waiting for me in her car she was really worried about you and would have helped but there were already mad people with you 
 but i m not going to turn around and say people can t use them because he took great enjoyment from it 
unfortunately mine is a small and i m not willing to part with it but i bet this would still look super rad if you fixed it up somehow think r visiblemending
speaking of long boards my buddy had the one that s means to go realllllly fast and is able to turn but you use the special gloves to turn i don t know the name and i went down a hill on it without the gloves or any knowledge of skateboarding and well i laid down and used my feet to try to stop before the main road and it it didn t go too well head over heels scraped along the ground for like feet it was brutal
medik
thank you i don t even have a board yet so your general answer really helps having it brake wow who in the world would ever consider that a good idea 
nice gams how did the accident happen 
they said they were gonna teach me a cool new skateboard trick and that i d finally fit in with the youngsters
 god damn years car crashes fallen from a moving horse multipul skateboarding accidents and many a toe stubbing still no bones have broken not even a stress fracture 
my diy uses a mini rc transmitter and reciever and upon loss of connection my board goes full throttle in terms of how often that happens not very and i don t believe it s ever happened due to an error as such more the fact that the controller starts to turn itself off momentarily when it gets low on battery this hasn t yet caused an accident as i ve noticed the sudden full throttle blips and gotten off real quick however earlier this year for a reason still unknown to me the drive on my board locked up at mph could ve been a board error might ve been a stone in the belt or under the wheel i m not sure but i faceplanted and went sliding down a much busier road than i should ve been riding i was very lucky not to be ran over by a truck but knowing that it could ve been a board error has reeaally dented my confidence as i m always paranoid it ll happen again 
so what if it looks like your going into battle actually one of the best perks lmao i love my armoured jacket get gear you love and feel like an indestructible badass whenever you want 
i felt like this could ve been funnier if there wasn t that millisecond delay on the opera singer s belt note an immediate cut to his voice would have had me more than the current iteration 
had a similar experience once people just don t get it the feeling you get and even the pain is a relief from every day stress and routine 
thanks people i ve done both those things i was just wondering if anyone had any information regarding the legality issued 
update able to take it back to jbhifi and have it replaced on the spot for free
