"I bought this board in November and on first use, it was great for me a beginner to electric skateboards. I found the 3-speed modes very useful in the beginning to learn but once I got used to the speed I felt it could use a bit more. Using it for school has been great and this board is pretty light so it's easy to carry around in areas where I can not ride it. The only downside to the ride is, it is quite bad going uphill but that is to be expected with only one motor. The breaks are pretty strong which can be helpful in quick-stopping situations but also not too strong where I feel scared to use them. Overall I feel like this is a pretty great board for beginners or students who do not need to travel very far and there are not many hills in your commute.Update: I have had the board for 3 months now and while I was riding it the board suddenly applied the breaks on me and stopped moving. I turned over the board and the power light was no longer on so I tried to switch it back on but the board would not turn on. I tried disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it thinking it was an issue with the battery but that did not solve the problem. After emailing the customer support they were very quick to respond and told me the issue was a motherboard failure and they offered to send me a new board which was very nice of them. Overall I would say even though the board did fail on me I am willing to give it another chance for how good the customer service is."
"Amazing skateboard! This was my first purchase of an electric type, basically anything, and I am very happy I spent my money here, the skateboard is very efficient, lasts long as well as very convenient when for example you are me, work is 10 mins driving away, I can get to work super fast, this skateboard is very fast, I weigh 140 and this skateboard is not weighed down at all, doesn’t slow it down, anything, this is the perfect skateboard, and I think nothing can beat this, and I honestly mean it! BUY THIS SKATEBOARD I RECOMMEND IT, THE REVIEWS CAN TELL HOW AMAZING IT IS! This was the first skateboard that I've ridden. As a beginner, I think this is an excellent skateboard and I had a great experience. I am a college student, I need transportation to transport between home and campus. The board has been nothing short of convenient and extremely useful. I only need to spend 20 mins on the road. I think the recharge for this board is really fast, only two hours of charging can ride for about 7 to 8 miles., but it is great for beginners to learn about electric skateboards. All in all, I think this skateboard is really good for beginners, and for daily use."
"As a college student, I've looked through and tested many boards and many board companies. Around a similar price point, this board is by far one of the most amazing things in the market. This price is standard for specialized boards alone, and this board is motor and battery-powered. This alone gave it a strong appeal to me. This board is also small (still bigger than a penny board), and it allows me to get from point a to point b easily. Both of these are very helpful on a college campus as I can carry it around by literally palming the underside/battery pack of this board and as it takes me to and from my classes at 8 mph.*I believe this would be the perfect board for younger teens/kids who are just starting as it is light, small, easy to learn, and safe. It may be a little slow for experienced riders, but this is even safer for younger ones.Pros:-JKing is a really strong company in the field with great years of research. Moreover, their customer support is similarly good.-Size: This board is figuratively pocket-sized and allows for easy facilitation of transportation. I can carry it around easily.-Weight: This board is surprisingly really light, especially for electronic boards. It weighs as much if not less than a regular longboard. This helps a lot in taking it inside of and out of classes and carrying it for long times.-Learning curve: This board is PERFECT for beginners as it lightens the learning curve. This board made it extremely easy for me to learn how to ride an electric skateboard. I mastered it through the help of this board, which is also helpful as it provides you with three-speed settings to go up as you learn.Cons:-Once I mastered the board, I wanted to branch out and try to go faster. Thus, I ordered a faster board from this same company due to their affordable products and good customer service. However, this was NOT necessary to go from my classes and dorm and back, etc."
"I'm 5'10"" and barely get space to stand on the board. My foot exceeds the bounds on both sides, making it hurt when riding over 2 miles. The gloss wheels also are not sturdy nor safe for roads. I suggest getting a proper electric board or a scooter (second-best option) or a bike (best option).The board looks like it can survive a decent beating, and for a first electric board this is quite nice. For travel purposes on roads, where control and grip are essential to safety, this board may not be the best. It can't handle the slightest uphill, for example. Also, being a small board, slight adjustments to weight can make the board turn, causing an adult rider with larger legs to fall if at medium-high speed. My foot seemed to touch the wheel every time I try to turn too much which is also risky (I have US 10 size shoes). The battery life is also questionable, after only a 3.5 mile ride the board gave out and I had to walk the remaining 0.7 miles carrying this heavy board. (although if compared to other boards it is insanely light).To get a feel of electric boards, this is perfect. But from a safety and practical standpoint you would be better off paying more for a board with bigger wheels, at least two motors, and longer length so you can fit on it and control it better. Personally I'd rather stick to a scooter."
"As a college student, this is such a good skateboard to get you around campus. I am able to conveniently zoom to and fro from my apartment to classes. The range is good enough for the price. I carry the charger in my bag and charge it when I'm in the library. This particular skateboard has plastic over moulding that protects the underside of the board when it's wet outside. I did not see that feature in other boards at this price point. This is a must have for college students looking to not waste their precious time walking around large campuses."
My 10 yr old son loves this board. He was able to learn to ride it very quickly. It’s sturdy and the battery has a good life span. Customer service has also been very helpful when we had questions. I would definitely recommend this electric skateboard.
"This skate board has been fantastic for our girls. They are the envy of all the neighborhood kids. My girls like that is goes so fast and it handles very well when you loosen the trucks a little. Being able to control it with the remote makes it fun to ride standing up or even sitting down on it. They used it so often that the battery went out on it. However the customer service is quick, and because of the product warranty, we are able to get a replacement quickly. My kids are excited to ride again!!"
"I go to a pretty big University so I had bought this board to use to get around campus. It is very useful, the remote is very simple and easy to use, and both the board and the remote charges fast. I can easily adjust the speed of the board as well as easily steer the board in between a crowd of people. This is my very first electric board and I would recommend it for other beginners (it’s actually easier to ride than an actual skateboard). For the price of this board it is a good choice!!"
"I love this thing it has a nice battery for long rides and it’s pretty fast for the size of it, it fits in your car no problem for if you want to do some exploring with your friends or just go out it’s pretty durable and it’s great for bigginers like myself 10/10 that all I can say it’s just a lot of fun"
My son picked it right up and rides it every day.
"We bought this skateboard for our son who does not ride a skateboard and he learned quickly. He absolutely loves this skateboard. It’s quick, easy to use, and gets a lot of attention as he rides it around. This board has replaced all of his riding toys and is his new go to. If you’re on the fence, just buy it, you will not be disappointed!"
He uses it all the time. Loves it. He rides it like 2 miles and still charged
Grandson's Christmas gift
Bought it to travel from MD to Cali and I did it!  No charging needed.
I really love this board. way more affordable than some of the other ones and great quality too. its battery life is quite impressive and I like the design of the board
"Simple, fun, and durable. Maybe the best Christmas present I ever got the kids. Plus it gets them outside."
Works awesome for the price but the tail is weak. First day I had it I pressed on the tail and it made a snapping sound and now it’s kind of flimsy. Can still ride great but beware of tail. Really fun to rip around neighborhood. Get about 3 miles going full speed around the newborns on a charge
The Skateboard is a great Product. I recommend it.
It is sturdy and rides fast.
"Great product works great, great build quality and best bang for your buck."
Grand son love it
Christmas present
Ordered June 3rd 2021. It is now August 19 2021. Doesn’t charge anymore. Complete waste of money. Since my window to return/ exchange was July 8th.
"I normally don’t write reviews but this one was important. I was able to get my board but after a week, my charger no longer charges my board. I read all the Do-Nots but it doesn’t charge at all. I am going to spend some extra money to buy a new charger but it worked really well at first. I hope no one else has this problem but it’s still a good board without its motor charged."
"Bought the board to get around on campus, I have no experience with skateboard, but I was able to learn quickly, the board is not hard to control and the break and reverse functions well. my board might have a battery defect, the battery died and can not be charged any more, the charger light show green when I plug it in and the board would not turn on. So I returned it. Hope it’s just a individual problem. It would be great if they could improve the battery"
Got it for my 14 yrs old for his birthday and I must say he loves it so much  it runs great and all for me just 1 problem I see is on the top of the board it has bubbles in few areas
The product was well packaged. It looks nice. It’s a Christmas gift so I won’t know how well it performs until December. The star rating could change after that. Hopefully in a positive direction.
It met all my expectations I had upgraded from a 4 mile 12 mph 1 motor and this blew that one out of the park. It is very very fast and also very scary. I will have alot of fun with it but respect it's speed and power.
Strong motor strong enought to go up hill had it two days now runs grate just need more stability on main road going top speed it gets wobbly but still able to control no bad review so far can b a more stronger batter and stronger motor but other than that I love it it gets me to where I need to go.
It worked about 15 days.  does not hold a charge anymore
"Stops at the tiniest incline unless of course you have enough momentum before to carry you over the incline. I was going up the CURB of my neighborhood and it stopped. I thought well I'll keep it since it is kind of fast. Then it died in less than 10 minutes. 2 hour charge for 10 minute ride? I'm 130 pounds, by the way."
"After 3 months, the skateboard doesn't work anymore,  I regret buying this skatenoard,  just save your money and buy some other brand.It doesn't have any warranty."
I use this to ride around my campus and with no warning after I get off the board started going backwards then glitched out.
The was the worst product I have ever bought on amazon. It broke a week after I got it.
"I ordered the item, I got it but it would not charge. I ordered a replacement and guess and guess what, it died after 2 weeks out of the blue. Worst skate!"
Broke after two rides
Bought this for my son for Christmas. He rode it all day then went to charge it and it won’t charge.
Great item for beginners or experts
"Terrible product and shocking customer service, bought for son for Christmas and after very little use, it stop charge now. Have tried to come to a solution with the company. I didn't get a response back from the company."
"This was the first skateboard that I've ridden. As a beginner, I think this is an excellent skateboard and I had a great experience. I am a college student, I need transportation to transport between home and campus. The board has been nothing short of convenient and extremely useful. I only need to spend 20 mins on the road. The board is not good enough to go up steep slopes but I think this is fine since some gentle slopes can easily go up for this board. I think the recharge for this board is really fast, only two hours of charging can ride for about 7 to 8 miles. The speed of this board is not so fast, but it is great for beginners to learn about electronic skateboards. All in all, I think this skateboard is really good for beginners, and for daily use."
"This was the first ever skateboard I've ridden and it has been a great experience. Being a college student on campus, the board has been nothing short of convenient and extremely useful. The board is also good enough to go up steep slopes. The only negative I have is that I would sometimes not be able to tell when the board is fully charged or not without the remote because the charger for the board would appear green even when not connected to the board. Overall, it's a great board with or without the motor and highly recommended for beginners."
"remote sucks and cant even ride the skateboard for at least hour bc the remote die's. and i got the board on May 12, 2022 and already had a get a replace on May 17, 2022, and still the same thing happens so not worth the money"
I purchased this longboard for my husband for Christmas and It was the best gift ever. Easy instructions and great for beginners. He takes it everywhere he goes. I can’t wait to see what other great products this company has!Shanell Smart
This was one of his best Christmas gift this year. He was outside practically all Christmas and away from his electronics. He loves it !!
It’s pretty decent. It runs for about 30 mins (5 miles) and handles pretty well. After the first ride the motor got kinda scratched and dented but it’s still running fine. The pictures on this ad are a little faked. It’s not as big as it shows but it’s still bigger than a penny board. It’s a mix between a long board and a penny board. It gets up to speed pretty well. Brake a little aggressive but once your used to it it’s easy to ride. Definitely would recommend for a beginner. If your looking to commute I’d recommend getting one that lasts longer.
This product is inexpensive. It costs about the same as a normal skateboard without a motor.  I don’t have to walk or get tired doing errands. I have 2 and plan to buy 2 more that go a longer distance in the near future. The Bluetooth wireless connection never had any problems and works immediately. I had good customer service experience!
"Im not goin to lie, the board turned out to be a great choice for my simple use. However, there’s one flaw that I believe can be easily corrected & that’s the “GRIP TAPE”. Today I damn near dislocated both knees because of the slippery tape. It doesn’t really grip so if you’re over a certain amount of weight like myself thn be cautious on how you maneuver on this board. In closing, I believe this is a simple fix: the GRIP TAPE needs to be THICKER."
Love it
