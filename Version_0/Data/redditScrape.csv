"I have a normal, probably most usual insurance plan, joint with my parents. I am a college student. My friend proposed me to try skateboarding, and I fell on the ground within the first 10 minutes. I have a concussion. I am in the emergency room, they held me in the ER for 6 hours and I still haven't gotten back my CAT scan."
"My mother is freaking out now that our insurance doesn't cover extreme sport activities, which skateboarding sort of is, so we'll go bankrupt for the CAT scan and waiting time in the ER. Idk if she is right. How likely is it that this will be used as pretext to deny coverage? I am using one of the biggest health providers in America, if it matters."
Yes! This is covered under medical insurance.
Next time wear a helmet
"I mean, no shit, but you can get a concussion with a helmet. It depends on how fast OP was going."
"It‚Äôs hard to say 100% without saying your specific policy but skateboarding isn‚Äôt usually excluded as an extreme sport. It‚Äôs not like you were jumping the Grand Canyon.
Also, you won‚Äôt be billed by waiting time, but by the complexity of your injury, the type of examination they perform and what kind of medical history they take (asking you about your injury). Since you‚Äôve been waiting 6 hours, it‚Äôs not a true ‚Äúemergency‚Äù like a gunshot wound and won‚Äôt be billed at the higher level of visit."
Yes you‚Äôre fine. Do not delay any medical care.
Call insurance company ask
"I am the only person in the family with decent English. I will be able to call them once I'm out of ER, but I really wish to calm her down for the remaining time. And the premise that falling from a skateboard is any different than an electric scooter or slipping and falling seems absurd to me."
I‚Äôm confused. Do you have reason to believe that your bills won‚Äôt be covered? The incident that caused your visit has no bearing on billing codes.
"Well, iirc, skydiving injuries, or scuba diving injuries, can be disallowed, depending on whether or not they're explicitly disallowed as ""high risk sports.""
But something like skateboarding? Nah."
"The cause for the injury doesn‚Äôt matter. If you are injured and treatment is considered medically necessary, it will be covered by insurance."
"Your injury will most likely be covered, most fully insured medical plans are required by law to cover common accidental injuries like this. And as for any exclusions for extreme sports, that only applies if you are a professional skateboarder/race car driver/some other extreme sport‚Ä¶ not for some kid trying to skateboard for the first time. You will be fine, but you will have a copay or some level of coinsurance, which can get expensive. You may also be responsible for a deductible, but there is an out of pocket maximum on all plans, so your liability is limited. The specifics will depend on your plan, so if you really want to know how much you will be on the hook for, you will need an EOB from the hospital, which they will typically send to you in the mail or provide upon discharge. Source: I‚Äôm an insurance broker."
"You and your mother are jumping the gun. When you get the EOB (Explanation of benefits) from your insurance company you will see how much they pay the hospital and how much you are being asked to pay. That is the only document that matters right now, the EOB.
It doesn't matter what the hospital is billing, it matters what insurance is paying and what the insurance says you owe.
And you won't know that for some time."
"Seeing the doctor soon. Skateboard accident, toes are swollen. I‚Äôm scared for the results."
We will find out if your a weakling
I am strong after all
"Surely a true strongbone would not be scared for the results.
Stay strong of bone, brother."
I‚Äôm side-eyeing you.
"Swollen toes normally means a sprain if memory serves, however, i may be wrong. Either way don't fear for the potential of weak bones. Strong bones must be reinforced further with an iron will."
"yeah, I damaged my tendons/ligaments. Pretty painful, but they're healing quickly"
"If your bones truly belong here, you'd know that you needn't be scared brother.
God speed on your healing if your bones are in tact."
I'm no doctor but I reckon wind resistance from the hairy legs was probably the real culprit here.
"It was a new electric skateboard I bought, so my fleecy legs stood no chance"

not broken! Just a pulled tendon

YA Book Young Boy in Coma After Bike or Skateboard Accident
"I read this book in middle school, I can‚Äôt remember the name or the author and google is zero help. It‚Äôs about a boy who breaks his neck in either a bmx bike or skateboard accident and is in a coma in the hospital. The majority of the time it seems like he‚Äôs not in a coma, he remembers the nurses coming to take care of him and he spends a lot of time with a girl who is in there because she has an ed. I remember it specifically mentioning she has a feeding tube and is upset about getting better. He wakes up from the coma and it turns out he never met the girl of course but the nurses talked about her while caring for him or something. He freaks out when he wakes up on a ventilator btw. At the end of the book he goes to a restaurant of some sort and sees a girl that looks just like the girl he saw in his coma and he‚Äôs confused because he never actually met her. That‚Äôs all I remember someone please help me find this book. TIA"

"Visiting the psychiatric ward for being sad, turns out my brain is turning to mush from an old skateboard accident ten years ago. Oops. Wear a helmet kids."

Ahwatukee teen in the ICU after electric skateboard accident at ASU
Electric scooters/skateboards freak me out. Couple that with the fact almost no one wears a helmet with those or bikes is a disaster waiting to happen.
"I don't think anything motorized (besides the DART and landscaping carts) should be on any path on campus. Like you said, it's a disaster waiting to happen. I do wish them a speedy recovery though."
"Yeah I'm not a fan of the electric skateboards. Few years ago I watched someone eat shit on one after smacking into another student who was walking and looking at their phone.
Also, people fly as fast as they can down the paths in Tempe, this was inevitable."
"I don‚Äôt think the scooters are too bad, given how they have breaks, the skateboards from what I can tell don‚Äôt really have breaks. I personally drive a small scooter around campus, going around 10 mph because no one needs to be going 20+ on campus, but I always wear a helmet and I‚Äôve never hit or had a close call with someone ever. I‚Äôve been hurt more by other scooter riders as a pedestrian. I always see people wiping out or hurting others with electric skateboards. I‚Äôll bet they‚Äôll get banned soon.
People always wear their damn headphones/AirPods too, pedestrians included, so no one hears a goddamn thing until it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôve had scooter/skateboard riders completely cut me off while I‚Äôm walking and I‚Äôm amazed at how they just don‚Äôt seem to care or don‚Äôt even realize it."
"Just gonna point out the phrase from the article ""took it for a ride without a helmet"".
I hope the kid's okay but let's be real: this is one of the best examples of play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
Indeed. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt lead to a Darwin Award.
My Brother got in a skateboarding accident and broke his ankle in three places. Any messages for him before he goes in for surgery?
What brother
I second this
"Lmao, ruthless."
"Three places? There's being a weak-boned bitch and there's being someone so pathetic they need to be put in a bubble like some kind of pet hamster. Your brother skated over that line about two miles ago, best of luck tho"
Remind him that you are the superior skeleton
Oh trust me I will as soon as he wakes up from surgery. How utterly weak and embarrassing to be related to this deformity
Is he though? He has the same pathetic genes. He has just been wrapped in bubble wrap his whole life.

James and Aleks joking about James' skateboard accident in Gta RP
James' laugh is the thing I missed the most once he left Cow Chop. It's so contagious yet bully-ish. Great they are joking about CC now.
Yup i bet aleks was laughing his ass off too shame he wasn't streaming at the time
is aleks‚Äô crim character new? i‚Äôm new to gtarp don‚Äôt fight me.
It's not new he is just now starting to play it a little more regularly. His old crim characters were Sergei and Vasily which he doesn't play anymore and His current main character is Bobby Smith (chief of police)
I‚Äôm glad we can all laugh about this at the end of the day..a sad laugh..but a laugh
Goddamn I wish these two would start a channel of just them......
"I have a lot of hope that Aleks and James will remedy their friendship sometime in the future, unless that friendship is already fixed that we‚Äôre unaware of. A lot of The Creatures still talk to each other occasionally after years of them disbanding and some like Ze and Gassy even stream/do YT videos together. If the beauty gurus of YT can start drama about each other, stop being friends, then eventually awhile after become friends again, then I‚Äôm sure James and Aleks will. We just have to wait and see."
‚ÄúSounds pretty fucking relatable man‚Äù too good
this is the content we needed right now
haha halfpipe. never forget.
Ahhh
So they are still cool? I thought everyone was saying James and Aleks had beef or something
People are fucking dumb and just say shit for drama. They are clearly not friends anymore but don't have any sort of beef or disdain for each other. For the last month or so whenever they have come across each other they have interacted pretty well.
People freaked out when I think Brett or someone said they hadnt spoken in months.

"Need advice, traumatic skateboard accident along with my poor decisions have lead me to a debt crossroads"
"So I'm sure you guys get these similar stories about hardship, credit cards, and loans. I am not here for pity or for a lecture about how horrible i am with money. I just have a handful of questions that are too specific to find answers without calling some places or asking here. Thanks.Sorry this ended up being very long, you can skip to the end for my question if your actually interested in giving me some advice, which i greatly appreciate!"
"So..... I'm not great with money, i make bad decisions. I buy expensive audio and recording equipment that i probably shouldn't own. I wasn't in debt but i had myself set up for disaster. i have a $400 car payment, 400$ rent, another $300 between phone and insurance, at least another $300 in misc subscriptions and bills from Sweetwater, and about 3 months ago i decided to finance a new Martin D28, that's about $250 a month. I make about 2.2k a month after taxes, so I was already stretched thin but i always pay all of my bills and keep my 3 credit cards paid off."
"In august I had gotten back into skateboarding after a few year hiatus, I'm 31. it was a great way to exercise for me. Then one day just cruising i managed to fuck up really bad, i fell and somehow shattered my pelvis and broke my Acetabulum, i had to get a major surgery and they had to basically screw me back together, yay!"
"Its now Nov, i still cant walk, but am lucky that I'm am essential to the operation of the business i work for so as soon as it happened my boss gave me a couple hundred bucks and let me do some work from home but it was only bringing in about $300 a month, not good. I went back to work after about a month and a half. I'm now making a lot less because I'm not able to work as much. I'm making about 1600 a month now but that will slowly change back to what i was making. During the time i wasn't able to work i had to use all of my available credit to pay my bills, luckily i have a wonderful fiance who paid for all of my food and whatnot, but i still racked up about 6k in cc debt, now its very difficult for me to catch up, all of my CCs are maxed and late. My bank account is negative all the time and I'm barley managing my car payment which I've prioritized as well as my insurance and phone. My credit score dropped from close to 700 to around 500 in that short time. Im also becoming a burden to my wonderful fiance who has already had to basically wipe my ass for a few months, i hate that, but am lucky to have her. Luckily my 100k in medical bills was completely wiped out through a charity type financial assistance program, thank god! Not having insurance really worked out in this scenario."
I'm extremely grateful for how this turned out honestly with the medical bills and my poor financial decisions i should be in a much much worse position. I completely understand that and am not trying to make anyone feel sorry for me in any way i feel extremely lucky. I honestly feel guilty that I have people who care and so many things went right at a time when so many people are so less fortunate.
"So, all three of my cards are stupid high interest 20+% APR, The minimum payments plus interest is too much for me to handle right now. After a few months of getting paid i can get back to being ok but its going to take me selling some gear and eating cheap, i already have listed a few expensive items on Reverb. I was looking into consolidating, the options on KreditKarma are a fucking joke, my credit score being so low is probably the reason. The options are all like 25% 30% APR and my car as collateral, i don't know who would actually fall for that. My question, finally, sorry, is....... Is there a better place i could go and say get a 5k lower interest loan with my car as collateral, i would assume putting my car up would drop the interest down to a reasonable 5-10%, is that ignorant of me? i know nothing about finances, obviously. Also, if that is a possibility, do you think it would be a good idea considering my circumstances? I just hate paying hundreds of dollars to these companies for basically nothing. In an ideal situation i could get a 5k loan with low interest and pay it off in a year or two and avoid all of these damn interest charges every month, they are really crippling my progress. I also do not want to have to sell my beloved guitars and gear but i am willing to do that if necessary, i just would lose a lot and end up never being able to replace the guitars, the two i have were 3k+ back before all of the online taxes and wood importing fees. In todays market they would be closer to 5k but it would take me years to sell them at a similar price., which i don't want to do, they are my favorite things in the world. Also, i tried returning the D28 that i bought a month before my accident and they were not having it because in my crippled state i accidentally knocked a heavy item into it cosmetically damaging it, it was a bad fucking month."
"Thanks for anyone who actually read this and is helping me figure out what to do, no matter what i know ill be fine, I just don't want to make any more poor decisions that lead me to a place where I'm actually fucked, THANKS!"
"So, basically, you are borrowing the value of your guitars and other gear at 20%+ / annual interest, something like that. You could largely eliminate the debt if you sell the gear, but you say you don't want to. That's a choice.
I'm not quite sure how you would think you would get another loan on your car if you already have a car payment."
"OP - glad you‚Äôre on the road to recovery, sorry this happened. Do you have a retirement fund you can tap into?
Everyone else. TL;DR - make sure to have an emergency fund. This is why‚Ä¶."
"Sounds like a good place to start is a nonprofit, legit credit counselor.
https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0153-choosing-credit-counselor
If you already got help with the medical bills, does the social worker or anyone from the hospital have a referral to someone?"
I‚Äôm sorry that happened. If I were you i would try to sell anything that could get me cash in order to pay off the payments w the highest interest ratings first. This might mean your car and guitar but it will reduce your debt by thousands and save you hundreds every month. I would also cancel any subscriptions. I have Netflix and Spotify so that would have to go. Dave Ramsey has a good program to help people w high CC debt called the Debt Snowball. I recommend watching some of his YouTube vids. Best of luck!
"I broke a car windshield in a freak skateboard accident, and i don't know what to do"
"Hello everyone, I'm writing here because i have no idea what to do"
"The story starts when i was going down a street with my skateboard and tried to do a trick, the board went into the street (which is a busy street i might add) it went under the wheel of an uncoming car, didn't break, flipped like 2 meters in the air, and fell on the window of the taxi driver, made a crack about the size of a baseball glove on the passenger side, he stopped in the middle of the street and i went back"
"I thought about running for it, but something stopped me, i gave him my facebook and my phone, and he told me he would call me tommorow and he added me as a friend. Today is the next day, and i dont know if i have to pay for it all, if his insurance will pay it, is it my fault? Or anything of any legal matter"

"NAL, but in most countries I'd say yes, it's your fault. It was your skateboard that fell into the street, and by the story I've understood that it could've easily killed someone. It is your responsibility to not let your skateboard get away in the middle of a busy street.
As far as money goes, you'll most likely have to pay for the repair of the windshield, since it was your fault. But since you were nice and did the right thing giving the driver your contact info, he might try to see if his insurance pays for the repair ( being a taxi driver, it's very likely, but I would not recommend rely on this). Wait until he contacts you and everything will be fine."
Your personal liability insurance will cover it.
"Be prepared to pay. If you have any liability insurance or car insurance of your own, you could possibly go through them as long as the deductable (the amount you pay) is less than the new windshield and your rates won't change. I'm not sure exactly how your insurance, if you have it, works, but those are standard things to look out for.
If you don't go through an insurance company, do your research. Find out from a reputable source how much the windshield should cost. Ask for receipts. Make sure the amount of money the driver is asking for is reasonable and legit. If not, you may want to consider getting a lawyer or going through some sort of arbiter.
The good news is that the cost shouldn't be impossible to cover. For a regular car I'd expect 500 euro to be a high end estimate (based on a quick Google that gave me info from the USA, so maybe a bit higher depending on tax?). It's a common thing and the service shouldn't be a premium charge."

Yesterday evening, my friend went out for a short ride on his Meepo mini, he didn‚Äôt have a helmet on.
I wasn‚Äôt there but he was going fast and got speed wobbles, he fell off at around 25 MPH and landed directly on his head. His skull cracked completely open and was rushed to the near by hospital where he was in surgery for about 10 hours.
He suffered a major injury to his brain stem and unfortunately didn‚Äôt make it through the night.
Wear your helmets boys and girls, it‚Äôs not worth the risk."""

Unfortunately people not wearing a helmet is going to bring a bad name to eboarding. This is a very unfortunate example of that. R.I.P Noah
We've only been crying for it for decades in longboarding
"Wow 25 MPH on a Meepo Mini... I get scared at 20 MPH on my WOWGO s2 with a helmet.
RIP dude"
Reasonably scared it turns out
so 3 fatal accident in a month. That is just scary.
"It's not just skateboarding -- rollerblading, electric skateboarding, longboarding, even biking (to a lesser degree) all have an image problem with the helmet and safety gear. It's really hard to convince people to wear their safety gear if they've never had a crash and/or none of their peers wear safety gear.
Now, once you've had a crash or there's been a crash in your riding group, everyone realizes that it *could* happen to them and they need to take this shit seriously.
I had never had a crash of any significance but I've read the horror stories and had people around me that encouraged the wearing of helmets rather than made fun of me (as a kid). And, even though I hadn't had any serious falls, any skateboarder will tell you that falling is part of the sport. You're going to fall. And, I've had many falls that start to make you realize how quickly something bad can happen.
Luckily for me, I was wearing a helmet the day that I got speed wobbles at about 25mph earlier this year. There is no doubt in my mind that my helmet either saved my life or saved me from a serious brain injury. I was thrown forward and my head ended up snapping back with the back of the helmet hitting the ground. I really shudder to think of where I would be today (if anywhere) if I hadn't been wearing a helmet.
As it was, I almost certainly had a concussion and was in a fog for the next 8-10 hours. I bought an even better helmet afterward (but hung on to my lifesaver) and will *never* ride anything without a helmet. I wish I could somehow convey this feeling to kids to make them understand the risk they are taking. For vanity? Fuck that. This is your life."
Thanks for sharing.
Very sad. From the description of the accident it really does sound like a helmet could've been the difference between a really bad crash you walk off and dying.
"Bro I see people mobbin thinking there so cool without a helmet and every time I think just wait g your time will come lmao everybody crashes don‚Äôt matter how good of a skater you think you are it‚Äôs bound to happen. Pad up, helmet up so what if it looks like your going into battle lmao just roll with it."
"so what if it looks like your going into battle
Actually one of the best perks lmao. I love my armoured jacket. Get gear you love and feel like an indestructible badass whenever you want."

someone give me their phone number so i can tell you where i am and you can pick me up

Are your teeth intact?
"Haven‚Äôt had real teeth for a couple years now. Just decided one day, hey, I‚Äôm a busy man, why waste time brushing my teeth when I don‚Äôt really need ‚Äòem? Stopped paying rent for a couple weeks in hopes my landlord would come knock ‚Äòem out but I just ended up with a broken nose. Ended up having to resort to the ol‚Äô ‚Äúbowling ball suicide‚Äù method. Now I wear dentures. Anchovy Joe is my denture guy, he‚Äôs great. He charges a lot and they fall apart really often, and they smell like fish... okay, maybe he‚Äôs not the greatest. Do you know a better denture guy? If possible another guy who does fishy smelling dentures. I actually like that part... reminds me of my childhood."
"I just recently (10/21 around 11am) got into a bad skateboarding accident with a car on Neil near the Lane ave garage. I just wanted to get in touch with the guy who help me and tell him thank you. If you are a premed student and helped me or if you know the pre-med student, shoot me a DM."
Was all that blood on the corner from you damn
"Yeah, that was me, sorry bout that"
I'm glad you're ok too. My girlfriend dropped me off to get covid tested that morning and saw you while she was waiting for me in her car. She was really worried about you and would have helped but there were already mad people with you.
"Yeah it was pretty scary, did she see what happened? I remember it but it‚Äôs be interesting to get another perspective on it."
"She saw the end of it. She didn't know you got hit by a car until I showed you her your post. Until we saw the post we both just thought that you had fell from your skateboard. I didn't really see anything, by the time I saw anything you were getting into a car."
There was so much blood
Did you see what happened by chance?
A man without a helmet died in an Electric Skateboard Accident
"‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt drink and ride
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt get high and ride
‚Ä¢ Use safety gear - at MINIMUM a helmet.
Just in case anyone hasn‚Äôt caught on yet. This hobby is fun but it‚Äôs also extremely dangerous, especially beyond 15mph.
Probably preaching to the choir but people still need to hear this."
Cruising blunts while riding is great
"‚Ä¢ Dont't ride a skateboard at 40kmh
Ofcourse it helps but is is dangerous even with gear tho
‚Ä¢ i like to puff and ride so relaxing lol
‚Ä¢ everyone knows this sub is like a helmet cirkeljerk reddit nowadays"
"Not even 15mph but even at a mild 10kmph(6-7mph) I'd say one wrong fall and you can be seriously injured.
As much as it'll be a ""we all know"" thing to at least ride with a helmet, and all the other precautionary, it's always better safe than sorry and let ppl know. Since there may be a grow new user base that may visit this community."
"Yeah speak for yourself.
I don't know what riding is like not high but I bet it's not as cool üòé.
Just know the limits of your abilities"
This happened almost a year ago btw
"RIP, man. Whatever you may think about the circumstances, this person lost his life and his family lost him forever. RIP to a fellow of our community."
"guys, please always wear a helmet. i usually never wore a helmet because i have an unusually large head and its impossible to fit in a helmet. even the xxxl sizes were too small. I was lucky to find one last week, and i just took a nasty fall backwards on my board and hit my head hard on the pavement. Thank God for this helmet"
"In case you weren‚Äôt aware, helmets are not meant for multiple impacts. Please get another one ASAP as the structural integrity of that one is now compromised and will not protect you the same as it could before."
"Sad that a man lost his life but...
why is the coroner writing to transport etc about it, the man wasn't wearing a helmet and was drunk, sadly his own neglect contributed to loss of life, not because of the electric skateboard."
Because England is the quintessential nanny state?
"Agreed. Let's regulate the hell out of esk8d and e-scooters because 1 person died.... Meanwhile, how many people died by car? And do they talk about it?"
"Title should read ""Man under the influence of alcohol..."""
"Sure and then they want to make it even more illegal , come on. They should ban alcohol or driving all together!!!"
"Note to self, don't go past 20 MPH, while drunk and wearing no safety gear."
I still have scars from the time I fell off an uber scooter last year
Tragic
"""But I'm not going to turn around and say people can't use them, because he took great enjoyment from it."""
"How stupid rider, stupid attitude will impact by new shit laws all people's who ride carefully and geared with protection! The guy is a Dad with children, and he didn't know it's dangerous with alcohol and no helmet on his board?
His wife statement is clearly childish and....stupid.
It hurts to have her husband, their dad in the tomb, it's heartbreaking, but don't reject the fault on the law? It's common sense."
"How is she childish and stupid? Woman lost her husband and father of her children. You expect her to be rational? Come on, be reasonable, don't call her stupid. Also she said exactly this to follow up:
""But I'm not going to turn around and say people can't use them, because he took great enjoyment from it.""
Sounds like a great woman to me."

Jackson was with a group of 6+ people and they all decided to go to what we call ‚Äúdevils hill‚Äù from the skatepark. The hill is about 3/4 of a mile if not a mile from the skatepark and Josh and I would only go down half of it because of it‚Äôs intimidation. Colin went down first without incident and came back up. Then Jackson went next and wasn‚Äôt so lucky. Jackson hit a speed of what seemed to be 30 mph before hitting a rock.
"He landed on his elbows, giving himself whiplash and slid about 20ft on the asphalt of the golf cart path before sliding off the path and to the side. I later there anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute before Josh came down next, found him, and tried alerting the group. He started waving his hands and jumping, but the message he was trying to send was unclear to the group so he ran up to the top of devils hill and told them Jackson was not ok and that the cops and his parents needed to be notified putting his senior year of high school on hold."
"Colin made the calls and about 5 minutes later, the paramedics drove an ambulance down and loaded him into it to go to the soccer fields where the helicopter was waiting. Joey and Colin both got Jackson‚Äôs chromatic glasses, wallet, car keys, and phone. When the ambulance drove him to the soccer fields, he was loaded inside the helicopter for a life flight."
"He was taken to the ICU at Grady hospital in Georgia and was determined to have brain swelling, three hematoma‚Äôs, and a skull with 2/3 of it fractured. He was prepared for brain surgery to reduce the swelling, however one doctor suggested pumping his body with sodium. So the doctors did just that. The brain swelling went down and he avoided the brain surgery. He did however, have to stay in the icu for about 4 more days for rehydration. After that was complete, he went through rehab at the shepherd center in Atlanta before being released into the world again."
"He was out of shepherd in 2 weeks and had his first speech, physical, and occupational therapy appointments a month from his release at shepherd. He went in for those appointments and they told him he had no reason to need it. He is still recovering but still has a long way to go with his cognitive recovery"

"I fell off my electric skateboard yesterday because the backwheels blocked. I fell on my back with full speed (35kmh) and hit my head on the floor. I had a loud ringing sound in my ears, was a bit dizzy and lost my ability to smell and taste after the hit. I went to the hospital right away and they made some tests. No concussion! I'm on painkillers right now and still got some neck and head pain. This happend yesterday and i still can't smell or taste wich makes me a bit anxious. Would love to hear some advice or tips what i can do or if someone had a same problem did your ability to smell came back?"
"I'm so sorry you're going though this! I did the same thing over 20 years ago, back of head, etc... Still can't smell. Was told at the time that either the olfactory portion of my brain was damaged or the nerves that connect to the brain from the receptors in the nose were severed. In either case, not a good prognosis. I hope you fare better! I have heard stories of people getting it back!"
"same thing happened to me, was holding onto the back of an electric scooter on my board, speed wobble and i slammed hit my head and fractured my skull. lost my sense of smell and taste, they told me they weren‚Äôt worried and it would come back. it‚Äôs been a year and a bit, i still don‚Äôt have it. glad you‚Äôre okay though! i have faith it‚Äôll come back, you got this homie!"
"I had a very similar accident where I hit the back of my head on the floor and lost my sense of smell. I am still healing 7 months later with no sense of smell. I damaged the nerves in the process. I definitely recommend seeing a specialist like I did. He/she can read MRI data and give you some info. They normally tell me that you can lose your sense of smell like this for about a year. Beyond that is normally permanent. But don't take my word for it, see a specialist"
"Sorry you're dealing with this, I hope it improves! I lost mine after a car accident, but didn't immediately realize it. I did not fully lose my sense of taste but it had decreased. Didn't see a doctor about the loss of smell until about a year later. He suggested it was due to shearing of olfactory nerves at the cribriform plate. I was told there was a possibility for the nerves to regenerate and form new connections and that I may regain my smell, but that if that does happen it could take years. He also said if I were to regain my sense of smell it would most likely be in the first 5 or so years and that if it had not improved in the first 10 years it would be unlikely to ever happen.
I'm at about 13 years later and don't seem to have regained much, if any, sense of smell. Over time I've actually become a bit more sensitive to some things, like the taste of vinegar. Sometimes I think I catch whiffs of smells, but if I don't have someone to check with I'm never sure if it was real or not. My body did compensate in one way, I either developed or heightened an ability to somewhat taste the air and detect qualities in the air that I can somewhat link to odors. Some of this is probably linked to 'smelling' things that trigger a response from the trigeminal nerve like vinegar, alcohol, menthol type things and some chemicals. It is definitely not a strong ability (for example I have a difficult time differentiating between eucalyptus and minty/menthol products), but I seem to be more sensitive than others to certain things - like a musty room."

Help me out I can't seem to get this window open. Nevermind it's open.
I have seen several times that controllers lose connection and cause an accident. I have 3 questions:
How likely are you able to recover from a disconnect to prevent an accident?
"No one can answer this question as no board is the same.
I could tell you my DIY has not disconnected after 1000+ miles but it means nothing to you.
Also, it really depends on how the esc is configured to operate during a disconnect. You can have it set to default to full brake for example. Imagine that while you're going 30 mph?
Not all boards operate the same in these scenarios and not all boards are built with the same electronics"
"Thank you, I don't even have a board yet, so your general answer really helps.
Having it brake, wow who in the world would ever consider that a good idea?"
"Agreed- Very hard to say but it does happen. 2yrs riding Evolve Bgtr and I‚Äôve had 3 disconnects (no wheels locking, just the jolt and free roll) in the same spot near my home- I think from braking with 100% battery. I now run it down to 95ish% - no disconnects anymore."
"Never had a disconnect due to board error, but my own stubborness trying to make it up a hill on one bar left on the eskate. On one bar, the eskate was very jerky, less braking power, delayed input. As I was leaning forward and crawling up the hill, I lost power briefly at the top, and I did a weird split with one foot on the deck still haha.
Don't ignore the ""low voltage"" warnings on the remote. Switch to the slowest speed mode, or walk up the hills to save some battery when you are on the last bar."
I've also been wondering what happens when you take a hill higher than the advertised incline. I'm guessing it does something similar to this. Thank you for your insight!
"Diy disconnect experience checking in - make sure that all your receiver connections are hot glued or secured so they don‚Äôt bite, short, or come loose causing a d/c. It was more user error/learning curve on my part. LEARN TO FOOTBRAKE. The ground is not soft no matter how much more comfortable it looks than your current speed."
"Do not buy a meepo board they have terrible quality, the board randomly shut off one day as i was spiraling into traffic expecting to be able to break."
"I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say Meepo is a bad brand, might have just been a bad experience, I owned my V3 for an entire year before switching to Lacroix and never had any issues"
"About 600 miles between a boosted mini and a revel kit for me, no disconnects. I live in rural/suburbs though and I wonder if more people/devices in a city is a factor."
Ah good to know Revel don‚Äôt suffer disconnects. I‚Äôm looking for a kit that‚Äôs easy to swap decks. I‚Äôve seen quite a number of Evolve with this problem.
My backfire g3 controller has only ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù once and i still could control the throttle and brakes. (Tbf i did jump into a mighty puddle)
"I havent had a disconnect yet. 5k miles on my wowgo 3x. Had a backfire, exway, and meepo before this. No issues."
"May have been said but I'd always make sure to ride no faster than you can traditionally skate brake, ie a foot slide. I've had 6 eboards and a couple remotes die mid transit. But realistically any big name consumer board has next to no real issues in mass production and just odd issues for a single boards here and there. But I can't stress enough how many injuries occur to those who have never skated normally or haven't in years and go ahead and zip off at 25 to get stopped by a single rock or crack and break an arm."
"Rode a Backfire zealot for 300 miles, no disconnections whatsoever. Made a diy with a vesc and flipsky vx1, and at 25 miles on the odo it has lost connection around 10 times Reconnecting took 3 seconds or so which is way more than enough to get you in big trouble"
"My DIY uses a mini RC transmitter and reciever, and upon loss of connection my board goes full throttle. In terms of how often that happens not very, and I don't believe it's ever happened due to an error as such, more the fact that the controller starts to turn itself off momentarily when it gets low on battery. This hasn't yet caused an accident, as i've noticed the sudden full throttle blips and gotten off real quick.
However earlier this year for a reason still unknown to me the drive on my board locked up at 20mph. Could've been a board error, might've been a stone in the belt or under the wheel, i'm not sure, but I faceplanted and went sliding down a much busier road than I should've been riding. I was very lucky not to be ran over by a truck but knowing that it could've been a board error has reeaally dented my confidence as i'm always paranoid it'll happen again."
"My DIY uses a mini RC transmitter and receiver, and upon loss of connection my board goes full throttle.
You can set the failsafe on that controller. Most set it to neutral.
https://forum.esk8.news/t/how-to-bind-the-mini-remote-serious/95"
Could have been a full disconnect from the board and not just a momentary disconnect. You could possibly try this by spinning up the motors with the board upside down and powering off the remote or making it lose signal for an extended period of time to see if thats what caused it to lock up.
"If you're a skater you worry a lot less about these things. Got a discord setup BTW that's kind of begginer focused and more about just cruising and exploring if you're interested?
But yeah little real skill and some techniques to slow yourself down and you'll be better prepared to deal with it. It's rare but not unheard of. I've had my power button wiggle itself off on rough ground a couple times which amounts to the same thing."
"Mostly only because of heavy interference or damage to the remote or esc. It's rare but we hear so much about them because when it happens, everybody posts it here, nobody comes to this sub to post his remote works flawlessly
Depends when it happens, and what does your board do when it happens, some boards keep rolling, some start braking slowly and some jam the brakes a 100% (looking at you evolve)

Anyone have experience with road rash? I got into a skateboard accident going fast downhill during June. Any tips or advice for what to do or if it will go back to normal?
"It's scar tissue more than likely it'll stay with you for the next two years, and if you're not lucky am I stay with you for the rest of your life. But don't worry it's not going to be a life-threatening, I have scars from 10 years ago that still haven't healed but they haven't caused any problems."
I appreciate the help. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs really noticeable and I just been insecure about it and I wanted to hear some advice on if it might go away or if there‚Äôs anything I could do. But thank you so much for commenting!
Guys I figured out how Sasha is going to lose her eye. It will be in a skateboarding accident. That's what she gets for not wearing a helmet.

I got into a bad skateboarding accident maybe 6 weeks ago and now feel incredibly nervous when on my board
"So basically, i had an incident where i landed on my leg, twisted it nearly 90 degrees, and tore my hamstring. I'm starting to feel good enough to skate again and attempted to last night. But I felt an incredible amount of anxiety and nausea everytime I was about to push off. Anyone know techniques to rebuild confidence?"
"If your hamstring is telling you to stop, then stop. If anxiety is telling you to stop then get back on that board.
Take baby steps to rebuild that confidence.if you don't get back on it now it's going to get harder and harder to get back on it down the line.
First thing I do if I fall on a trick, if I haven't seriously hurt myself, is try the exact same trick again."
Thanks a lot. My hamstring is feeling fine for the most part. I just need to push myself to getting back to comfort
"I'd say just take it slow but keep skating as much as possible.
How'd you do it anyway?"
"basically my foot caught in the wheel as i was pushing myself forward and kinda got stuck on the floor. my board kept going, pulling my other leg as it went. This forced me into a split, and then I lost my balance, fell, and twisted my left leg nearly 90 degrees."
"Just start from square 1. Push around, feel the board under your feet. It‚Äôs hard to get injured when you‚Äôre just going for a cruise. When you‚Äôre good with that, start trying some of your favorite tricks again. Low risk low effort ones like shoves is a great place to start"
Funnily enough I somehow managed to hurt myself last time on a cruise
"That's a tough one, confidence is such a hard thing to grasp. I injured myself quote a few times too, once I twisted my ankle badly after basically landing from a high jump with my board on top of my foot, nearly tearing my ankles. I was back on the next day, despite the pain. Getting back on quickly is often key, as you simply don't have time to mull over what happened. Unfortunately that ship has sailed for you. Not sure what to suggest other than ""try to push through"". You're the boss of your body, if you tell it to go, it'll go, mind over matter. Take it slow, just step on and maybe let it roll down a gentle decline, getting the feeling back in your body. It'll pass, bro!"
