"And where I lived wasn't even far from, the hospital especially where I crashed which was closer."
when I was younger I didn’t think a hunting knife was that sharp and ran it really fast across the inside of my fingers. Two fingers opened it to the bone and I could see it before blood rushed out.
"The bottom line is the main focus of any laws or regulations should be on actual safe riding practices, and teaching new scooter owners how to ride safety in different city environments, not on simply limiting the speed or power and thinking that will make everything super safe."
I read the comments and don’t even know what country the guy was in.
"So MSFT beat earnings, strong guidance.  If the same holds true for TSLA and AAPL, and JPow doesn't do anything unexpected, this could drag the market up and shift momentum.    It's weird how top heavy the market is, but hard to argue against."
"I broke my right wrist in 8th grade. My grandparents lived at the very top of a cul-de-sac that had a pretty steep incline..well my older brother being my older brother, had taken something from me and in an attempt to retrieve whatever it was, I hopped onto his newly gifted electric scooter and started after him downhill... Well said scooter only had a break on the front tire so when he abruptly stopped and I pulled the handle for the break, I promptly flew over the handlebars of the scooter and onto the asphalt. Everyone was actually so much more concerned about the gash in my chin that we didn't realize my wrist was broken until about 20 minutes later when the paramedics arrived (a concerned neighbor saw an ""un-helmeted"" child crash onto the road outside of their house and called 911)."
"I feel like hoping that one day I'm gonna bring back my old life was really eating me from inside. And you will see people that accept that this is the life and there's no going back have better quality of life. I know that your journey is different than mine or anybody elses, but there can be enjoyment in your life again, it's possible."

Similar to this. I’ve nearly taken out a kid on electric scooter a few times over the previous weeks.
Tinted windows (Cal. Veh. Code § 26708.5).
"Simultaneously any stand up scooter which is gas powered OR bicycle which is gas powered should not be allowed. They’re too noisy, they smell bad, breathing in that smelly air is not healthy, and they go too fast."
"Not sure what was going on with that last one.... Was expecting another scooter crash, not crashing into a building...."
"If your problem is urban development patterns enabled by long distance commutes, motorcycles may not be much help at all. Higher speed enables longer distance commutes, decoupling distance from effort (as in any motor vehicle) enables longer distance commutes."
Thanks for the clarification. Can you share the negative experience you talk about a bit ?
Then it will be permissible (in the reddit hivemind) to make fun of him again.
Ted: That's your prerogative.
"That is why there should be road/bike path speed signs just like there are for cars on the road, you can go as fast as the road speed limit allows, no need to artificially limit the scooter itself, and those that break the speed limits should be fined by police same as other vehicles when they speed."
"Just my two cents, as a scooter rider, so take with a grain of salt:"
"[More New York] Woman swipes 112 rings worth $450K in Manhattan Diamond District heist » Belnavis was supposed to be turned over to waiting New Jersey police, but he was simply let go, the sources said. The mistake was noticed about an hour later, the sources said."
"here's them calling it a ""crash"" and lightening his skin"

"Being immortal doesn't mean much when you're twenty-five, broke, and living in one of the most expensive cities in the country."
"Buy a VnR kit, an expensive battery pack, always wear a backpack  or attach the ugly battery pack on the fender."
Children laughing.
"The bag has an almost non-existence level of organisation and because of that, I am having to use a separate organizer pouch to carry loose items. What that means is that the pouch eats up quite a bit of the space within the bag that could have been saved if the bag had organisation built-in."
Yeh nah leave your physics text book on the bookshelf and just Google it.
"Yeah, they crash... at a max speed of like 20mph, not 50 or 60 or 95mph. They also aren't 2-9000 lbs (looking at you electric hummer) so even if you do crash you aren't going to be that hurt, the most happening being a broken arm or wrist."
"If your dog has high prey drive, it’s much safer and controlled to have them run beside you as oppose to pulling you. Or do some actual mushing training to get some control commands down before expecting him to run nice. There’s probably even clubs or groups nearby for mushing."
"Battery fires in electric vehicles, according to Forbes, can happen due to two reasons."
"If you want advice on how to choose and size mobility aids or what kind of access barriers are at Disney for people with mobility difficulties and how to navigate them, feel free to reach out."
"Okay, I think car safety should be way more regulated, but I also think scooter safety is not great."
"Backline is insane - Quinn is one of the best ball carriers going around in the game currently, so keen to see some crash ball from him."
"In the course of 10 months, I had to bury three of my best friends. In June, my best friend dies while climbing (fell down the edge), in January, my other best friend dies in a electric scooter accident (hit and run from behind) and now, a few days ago, my third best friend dies in a motorcycle crash. How tf to you cope? I drove home at soon as I found out (I live in Norway, family and friends in Sweden - 630miles one way) The sadness is overwhelming, feels like I can’t breathe and I really don’t know where to go from this. If it’s even possible. Any advice, any tip, just anything. I’m to deep out on my own."
"It's rough, but so long as you're either willing to put up a lot of money or willing to accept shorter range/lower speed, there are options."
"the smaller engine/lower top speed you have, the more you limit your options for responses to road hazards. Whether you get a Scooter that doesn't require an M-Class license or not, i highly recommend taking a motorcycle safety course."
Dashed line. I've seen d dashed lines on speed 25 and that's a residential area so for sure speed limit 25 if not 30. Yes both are at fault simply because driver should have seen skate boarder and should have known slow down while driving up sooner since he doesn't know if he will come out in front of him or not. Drivers have responsibilities too such as being aware of their environment the most compared to a skateboard which at most could would just tap the car. The driver could accidentally kill anyone at any point if they aren't paying attention. The amount of people who have pulled out Infront of me when I'm right there. The amount that pull out and then stop like deer in headlights when they realize they messed up instead of commiting and avoiding an accident. The amount of cars that have accidentally ran over bikers/cut them off and felt the need to tell the biker (bicyclist)   to look where he's going when they're the ones fucking up  Drivers who are too comfortable with their vehicles. You're the people who crash the uhuals into gas pumps! You're the people who take turns too fast and end up going off the road! You're the people riding ass on the freeway in the fast lane when if anything happens to the car Infront of yours you're also fucked because you wont be able to react in time. You're the lemming of the road. Michael from the office captured it completely when the directions told him to drive into the lake and he did.
"You might also discover when you're at the office that they're accommodating/accepting to cycling - they might have a changing room (maybe even a shower!), or a little space to store your bike/scooter. Maybe you can bring the scooter to your desk to charge."
The two fires in Paris and similar incidents worldwide have raised concerns about the safety of electric vehicles amid a push toward making them replace those running on fossil fuels by activists and lawmakers.
"I also enjoy r/nonononoyes This sub shows videos of people getting into bad situations, but it always turns out ok by the end. Like two cars look like they're surely going to crash, but then they swerve gracefully at the last minute. Or a kid showing off skateboard tricks, tripping badly and then falling over a wall, but then landing softly in a field of clover where bunnies are playing."
Sitting on a porch with coffee in the morning.
"If I learned something from this, is that no matter the conditions, you can still behave like a dork sometimes so always wear your gear! I didn’t at the time of the crash (it was hung on the scooter stem) at fortunately bothing happened (good reflexes + putting your hands first)."
"I sold my car in 2098 due to economic hardship caused by the crash. Since then I’ve used bikes, trains and the odd bus. 4 years ago I bought something you might consider: a Piaggio MP3. Scooter with 2 wheels at the front. Can be ridden on a car licence. Much cheaper to run than a car. The 400cc and 500cc are plenty powerful for open country roads. They’re much more stable than 2 wheels and are literally twist the throttle and go. A good option if you only use a car occasionally. Not sure how feasible given the UK climate. Also you need protective clothing even on a scooter but nothing like the leather outfits motorbike enthusiasts wear. It might be an option for the warmer months when you want to go further afield to places otherwise inaccessible on public transport. They re much quicker than a car because you can zip past lines if stationery traffic. You also don’t have issues with parking. With the amount of speed cameras on UK roads they’re not so scary to ride because the rest of the traffic has to keep to a sensible speed. You do need to be a confident rider and know how to drive defensively. Other thing is you have much better visibility than when you’re in a car I mean you can see more what’s going on. Finally I actually don’t think you can function as a properly independent adult without your own transport. I also find myself increasingly intolerant of the anti social behaviour of other passengers - listening / watching content on their phones without headphones, turning the area around them into their office, man spreading, lack of awareness of boundaries, clogging up space with electric scooters, body odour…"
"In the days that followed, Beast was aggressive to people in the community, jumping up at and towards them and biting at least two people, Michael Ball and Sian Sullivan. Ms Sullivan was injured by the dog on November 7, the day before Jack was attacked."
Unfortunate that they would phrase it like that on the CBC article when it sounds like they don’t know what happened yet and it’s more probably likely that the driver hit the guy on the scooter.

"In all seriousness, when you choose to disobey leash laws, you have the potential to cause a great deal of harm and you ruin the enjoyment of public spaces for a large number of dogs and people alike. Furthermore, ask any local dog trainer if the majority of off-leash dogs they see have a reliable, distraction proofed recall or are exhibiting safe or socially appropriate behavior. The answer is a resounding and overwhelming no. It’s often a no even in off-leash designated areas but that’s another topic."

"My skateboard is pretty stable. 50-60mph would honestly be fairly easy to achieve on this board comfortably. Pebbles, cracks and such aren't an issue. We also make sure we know the road before going full send."

"The scooters are small and all the noise is at ground level, which makes it near impossible for anyone on a bike to pick it out. Its bad enough when speed bros zoom past you without saying so, and that's a bike: a mechanical gyroscope.

"It's also important to talk about your feelings and share what you're going through, if you're lucky enough you'll have your family and friends to talk to, if not this sub is just fine, it helped me tremendously throughout the years.

"In summary: Get a bike if you want to exercise, and care about using it outside of just commute purposes. Also if you care about safety, it's a safer option because it's generally slower and has bigger wheels."
"I was walking next to southern cross station last night, two girls on electric scooters came blasting down the street while honking their bells at me to get out of their way. I completely stopped and stared at them because I froze for some reason, and to my delight the second girl somehow managed to lose control of her scooter and mildly crashed into a wall after suddenly swerving sideways because I didn’t move out of the way ☺️"
"Been there, done that. With good quality armour and assuming you're not riding like an absolute moron, the overwhelming majority of accidents are just a financial pain in the ass with a bit of bruising."
"Smartwheels use sonar, laser range finding and millimeter wave radar to identify mufflers and other debris. Each one consists of a hub with many tiny spokes. Each spoke telescopes into five sections. On the end is a squat foot, rubber tread on the bottom, swiveling on a ball joint. As the wheel rolls, the feet plant themselves one at a time, almost glomming into one continuous tire. If you surf over a bump, the spokes contract to roll over it. If you surf over a pothole, the rubber prongs probe its asphalt depths. Either way, the shock is thereby absorbed, no thuds, smacks, vibrations, or clunks will make their way into the plank or the Converse hightops with which you tread it. The ad was right - you cannot be a professional road surfer without smartwheels."
I have been through the panic and desperation you describe when you talk about that voice that says what’s the point. I’m sure everyone here has been through it.
"As much as I don't like any mandatory regulations, this is a perfect example of why all scooters should comply with a set of safety and quality standards and certificates before they can be sold. Same as cars or motorcycles that need to be manufactured to strict safety standards that ensure a higher level of safety for the end customer."

Breath of fresh air amongst the skateboard and car crash videos.
Two questions:
"A yes, nothing like a news story to create hysteria. Wow, electric scooters have been ridden recklessly, which caused a crash. A statistic showing how scooters are far more dangerous than other 2 wheeled vehicles would have helped you more. What about the 5 year old girl who was dragged across the ground after having been hit by a cycling travelling 10 mph? I’m sure if that cyclist had insurance everything would have been better right?"
"Bought a house in my early 20's when that was the cool thing to do.  For my 24th bday I went pretty hard to make sure there were a lot of ladies and booze to facilitate a good party. At one point I noticed that a bunch of people had disappeared so I went looking and found someone's younger brother standing outside my bedroom door with his ear pressed to it.  Kicked him out of my house because I didn't want there to be drunk teenagers hanging around, then I start banging on my door because ""nobody is allowed to fuck in my bed if I'm not invited.""  Get inside and find my room mate was in there having a lesbian threesome and a guy I knew was taking pictures of them with my camera.

"I know this reply is a novel, and whenever I see this issue of Caro writing a book called Scammer that she took money for but never wrote (and won’t), I think about BK, and the 2017 performance art installation. I’d never put the two of them even remotely in the same category, but I just can’t help but think that if Caro had done something similar - or at least as clever as - BK did, it would be brilliant performance art. But she’s no BK so what could be a fascinating commentary is just a sad situation where a 30 year old woman can’t grow up and can’t be honest with herself that she’ll never write the book, yet delusional enough that she thinks she will."
My friend always explained away his abuse injuries by telling teachers they were from a skateboard accident.
"In the meantime, Winona is going to be using SotW to take car parts and mould them into a kind of body armor that she and Ravee can use in order to get better defense against Red’s ballistics. Now, this isn’t easy to do while being stationary, which is why Winona isn’t going to stand in one place. Rather, she’ll be turning wrecked cars into gel and running through them, coating herself in gellified metal before turning it back to regular form, now shaped around her body. Winona will also be collecting smaller pieces of shrapnel and shards of broken glass from the crash, turning her arms into gel for a moment to store these pieces inside herself. This will hurt, but with 5 END she’ll be able to hand it, and it’s not going to be staying there forever, she’s got a plan. Lastly, she’ll turn anything not being used by her and Ravee into gel, disabling it from being used by Red for creating cars with SCB. This goes for any of the crashed cars they drove past along the way as well."
The feeling you get kissing someone for the first time.
Electric scooters are illegal.  I’d let your insurance know about the accident but it’s unlikely they’ll do anything to cover the damage to the scooter. They will cover the damage to your car though. Even if you aren’t going to claim you should still let them know about the incident - you never know if something comes of it later.
"The gag initially works in that the viewer doesn’t anticipate the crash. On rewatch it’s less surprising, but his dedication is more impressive. Either way it’s still pretty funny."
"In that instant, your fear that your friend is hurt overrides any thought about the video."
"BTW, riding a skateboard drunken is completely legal (as long as you don't cause an accident) even though it is way more likely to crash with those:"
"You can pretty easily reach 20km/h on a bike, and if you crash into a pedestrian, you can do some serious damage. Only vehicle I think is tolerated on the sidewalk is non electric scooters, skateboards and rollerblades. Then again you can't go faster than 8-10 km/h on those vehicles anyways which won't cause much damage to pedestrians in case of a crash, then again common sense should apply, but there are too many self centered assholes everywhere."
All of these have very pure “Barca DNA” — although the source who knows Xavi denies that he will be too idealistic or purist in his philosophy.
"If person a is drunk and hits person from behind, person a's insurance pays out for person b's car. They then pursue person a for their costs as they have breached ts and cs. If person b is drunk and sober person a hits the back of them, person a's insurance will pay out for both vehicles, as person b is not liable despite being drunk. Insurers know they would not win a civil case there as the criminal offense of drink driving isn't really relevant there."

With what I have now (a Honda CR-V)  I can just scoot my butt into the seat. And I have to use adaptive hand controls, which may not be available on a smaller vehicle.

"Insurers don’t need much excuse not to pay out, someone using an electric scooter breaks a number of laws making them personally liable for their own losses. The scooter it’s selfie has to be taxed, insured and MOT’d as they are not legal for road use they cannot be insured, you can’t tax or Mot them, and the rider would probably be breaking a host of driving licence rules as well, if someone is breaking the law, riding down the path on an illegal vehicle, the insurers definitely won’t pay out. Would be up to the scooter owner to challenge that and prove why the driver should pay out."

"Granted, you are on your way home one day when a stray yellow Vespa SS 180 Scooter hops the curb and crashes directly into you. The collision results in your penis being ripped off at the base. Immediate and expensive (America only) surgery is done to save you but the injury left your penis mangled beyond repair.

"When covid hit, and the number of food delivery riders surged due to increased demand and also an increase in the retrenched or furloughed taking up delivery jobs. These riders work with tight schedules and many of them opt to ride bicycles as they can be parked closer to the pick up and drop off points as well as being cheaper. This of course boosted bike usage and so cyclists started using the road in some legs of their journey to cut their traveling time or simply because there weren't adequate cycling paths. There are definitely bad actors who flaunt road safety rules and ride even brasher than drivers but for the most part, I think cyclists are aware of the risk they take on the roads."

A cheap scooter has a very small battery with really cheap cells  useable charge cycles 300 the max has a bigger battery  that will have around 500 charge cycles a bigger battery needs less frequent charging  so it’ll take much longer to have the battery become unusable  the max has 10 inch.

"I've noticed that I don't want to use weed as much since I started microdosing. I still vape a tiny bowl in the morning for my seizures and don't feel anything but one day I decided to vape a few bowls after taking my MD dosages (.2-.28) and I felt like I was on a baby trip, if that makes sense. With my eyes open, everything was normal. I just felt kinda high. When I closed my eyes though, it was trippy AF. I saw an elephant/giraffe mix taking a huge dump by a beautiful waterfall, I saw this cute dachshund with deformed legs go rolling by me and I thought he was sitting on a skateboard but he had wheels implanted in his legs and he was so happy just rolling around, I watched a german shepherd morph into 100 other breeds of dogs, I talked to a few of my dead relatives, etc. It was awesome! It lasted about 2 hours. I was tired after that and usually I don't crash on my MD, but worth it. I have never done a macrodose and had been sorta afraid of doing one, but now I can't wait. I'm going to a friends lakehouse in a few weeks and plan on sitting on the dock and tripping for a while."

As are skateboards and roller blades (providing you’re not occupying a bicycle lane) the issue is electrified things without the right ADRs (headlights, tail lights, horn, as well as other safety features that would have to be added to pass ADRs) that’s the issue."
"we had a very progressive policy on 'special mopeds', especially electric and replacing cars. Less pollution, taking up less space, fits with the Dutch bike infrastructure."

The Citibiker was visibly shaken at how close of a call it was. While the e-scooter guy didn't miss a beat and just laughed about it as he sped off. I've seen more accidents involving e-scooters than anything else so far.

"NO CAFFEINE UNTIL YOU REALLY NEED IT: very helpful tip I learned on Reddit. After your first caffeine high of the day you start to crash, no matter how much caffeine you drink throughout the rest of the day. I try to not drink caffeine until I know ill be off the road within 6 hours."

"You do realise legality /=/ safety? You seem to think that a law is passed in parliament and something becomes inherently safer because of it. Bicycles, scooters, and the like, are all only as safe as you make them. How does one riding a scooter in a bike Lane, as the same manner as every other 2 wheeled road user, suddenly created some huge risk which children and the elderly are now doomed?"
"One of the girls from earlier in these stories came to visit Vegas after being gone for a few years and came over to my house to try some shrooms.  We tripped balls all night, but I was especially in another dimension.  At some point she starts talking to me about her boyfriend and in my mental state I thought she was venting or asking my opinion about their freaky stuff so I just tell her ""it's cool, if you guys are into freaky things you shouldn't let anyone give you a hard time about it.""  The next morning when I was alone as I'm piecing my night together I realize she wasn't venting, she was telling me her BF wanted to watch a video of her getting banged by another guy and that was her original reason for coming to my house, but I was too spaced out to understand all that.  So I called her up in the morning and confirmed that I hadn't imagined it, and then invited her back over to give it a go and she recorded it for her BF to watch with her when she got home."
You do what feels right to you. But I once rode a scooter for like a 15min journey in the city and I never ever want to do that again. And I say that as someone who comfortably rides a bike in city traffic (in the same city even).

"So, gonna give some context here, I live outside of my nearest city in the country. I occasionally see dirt bikes and four wheelers (atvs) riding down my road, even if they are doing so illegally (and stupidly). I also agree that ebikes running down my road at 20mph would be less safe than those dirt bikes, due in large part to bad drivers (Ive seen enough assholes roll coal or curse at bikes in the road to prove that). However, putting more than 750 watts on bike without caveats is probably not the best idea for a few reasons."

I’ve been a BK fan since I was a teenager, I’d never seen her work in person, I was stoked. The tickets were online and free, which was odd, and when I got to the gallery space in SoHo where people were waiting around the block to get in, it seemed that everyone shared my confusion about why the tickets were free. What’s more, no one knew what BK’s new photos would look like. Or if it was a different type of installation, what it would be. We stood in line for an hour, inching slowly into the building, everyone craning their necks to see BK’s new work."

"In one example embodiment, if the side rails herein change to a five-degree downward tilt as soon as possible after the wheel connection points, then tilt back up five degrees, this allows a one-wheeled electric skateboard to now operate at a maximum seven degrees nose down angle which could not be achieved through any other method currently on the market and previously was limited to two degrees though the custom digital shaping mode."

"If Red wants to begin this battle with bullets, Ravee intends to shut down those dreams quickly. Ravee first creates a gap in her shooting by throwing some kind of kinetic projectile like a rock or piece of metal to temporarily distract her. If she’s not shooting at them then they’ll goad her into firing with Ravee preparing to activate 100 Years as soon as she looks to start to fire, capitalising on her fury of winning by pointing out how she’s likely lost the race. She’ll use any opening in which she’s not shooting to goad her into  As Red fires at Ravee with intent to kill, she’ll soon learn how dangerous 100 Years of pain really is as Ravee will invert the bullet’s trajectory, as well as any grenades lobbed at her, along the path back towards Red. While this is happening, Winona can also lob projectiles from up above in an arc at the same time, blocking any attempt Red might make to dodge the bullets and ensuring she gets struck by her own attacks or Winona’s fiery rock and shrapnel shots. Any time that Red makes a duck for cover, Ravee will duck back and heal back up with Winona, using SOTW to do so as well as healing up any cracks in the ground caused by 100 Years. Additionally, if the ground becomes too unstable for her to take a stance on, then Ravee will unleash a blast of energy with 100 Years and duck back and/or take off on the hubcap board, looking for a new spot to continue this section. This technique of reversing attacks will be known as Vadi Kata [Tala]."
"I’ve bought an electric scooter recently to go back and forth from work (something similar to the divvy ones, just faster). I’ve literally had people come into my lane, travelling the wrong direction, to scare me and have caused me to crash. Not exactly the same, but representative of the same jackassery."
"Just last week I crashed on my electric scooter into a guy on a bike in front of giesel, broke my hand, got surgery (6 screws and a plate) at ucsd jacobs medical center and now I’m home 2 hours away from campus and I can barely move my hand. Y’all be careful for real out there!!"
"I remember the nasty looks from this old lady for moving too slow and parking in a disabled spot at Target. A month and a half before, I had been in a bad car crash that almost killed me and I was recovering from major back surgery. I’d graduated away from using my walker or a scooter in stores, I was finally able to walk under my own power. I was slow and leaned on the cart a lot, but after paying at the register, I stopped on a scooter at the front to rest while my friend paid for her items. This old lady came up to put away her scooter, she just glared at me, didn’t ask for me to move, just stared. I slowly, yet as quickly as I could, got up and out of her way, she continued to stare. Then when getting into my friend’s car with my temporary placard, same lady followed us out and glared at me again. I pointed her out to my friend who very loudly started asking how my back was after major spinal fusion and asked how it felt to be in a coma. The lady got in her car and drove off really quickly when she overheard that."

"Fun story: I’ve ridden 3000 km on a xiaomi pro 2. After that, I sold it and upgraded to a Widewheel which already has about 800 km on it. I am a car driver too so I have experience, but I bought a helmet just in case. Anyway, Familiar day, familiar road, dry conditions (summer hot), no fucks given…UNTIL I barely accelerated (max 1-2 km/h) and I somehow tripped over my wheel during a right turn. I was fine, the scooter is perfect (didn’t even scratch to my surprise), but what I did after I got up was feeling kinda stupid, still feels today."

Feels like 60% of the needed multiple compression is done with some names probably nearly done and others (AAPL, TSLA, GME, AMC) needing a fair bit more work.  But all things considered, a quick repricing of markets will probably help in the long term.  A lot of stocks probably don't have much room to grow if they have to prove it with earnings and aren't getting a continually expanding P/S or P/E ratio like the last 3-4 years.  Worth keeping that in mind."

"Stating from a stop feels abrupt.  Scooter kicks back on its soft suspension and gets front wheelspin.  After the first 2-3 feet, it feels sluggish.  Approaching my set 19mph limit seems inconsistent and slow, dawdling around at 14-17mph on a flat road sometimes.  On the other hand, low speed maneuvers at walking pace are especially well controlled.  The motor programming is overall different than I am used to.  I am using the top sport mode and level 7 for both accel and regen.  The comfort mode is unpleasant to me and seems capped at 15mph so I stopped using it after several blocks, and I didn’t bother to test eco."
"Skaters mostly just listened to punk but we also got into metal, especially Thrash. Slayer, Metallica, Anthrax. We actually skated with Anthrax once. They came out before a show and hung out with us. Super nice guys. They were into Judge Dredd which at the time was an underground comic book and not even a Stallone movie yet. Lots of punk bands like Suicidal Tendencies, DRI, Cro Mags turned Crossover which was thrash-punk influences."

"Fresh out of highschool, 18 year old making good (for a college student) money, I got myself a 2014 jetta tdi from a delearship in the shady part of town (known to sell lemons, and just general used carsalesman type of practices) that particular dealership had nicer vehicles and had a nice new office built, but that was a sham. So first weekend driving the car the transmission broke down so the dealer had it replaced, car worked great after that but a few weeks later I gave my friend a ride after he dropped his bike off at a shop to get his seat reupholstered, and we were on the spaghetti bowl on one of the loops and I heard a weird noise and I kept hitting the break to slow down to turn and not hit the loops barricade but nothing. So we hit a barricade going 60 mph, somehow flew up in the air did a few barrel rolls, landed up right facing traffic and survived. Thankfully everyone that was near us quickly stopped and helped us out of the totaled vehicle and no other car was hit and me and my friend were fine. I thought I only sprained my ankle because it hurt to out weight on it, but the next day I couldn’t walk and both my feet were swollen and purple. So I crawled to the bathroom washed myself, then called my parents to pick me up, had to crawl downstairs lay on a skateboard and used it to help me get to the vehicle, went to the ER and waited like 13 hours to get a bed and get xrays. They originally told me i fractured my ankle, and were going to cast me up and release me and get me crutches but I was like the other foot hurts more than the break how am I suppose to bear weight in it with crutches? So this brand new ortho intern came in and wanted to take a second look and diagnosed a lisfranc injury on the left foot and took a look at the xrays on the other leg and saw that the fracture would need a plate because if it wasn’t reinforced there would be a chance that it could break again the bone could slice a major artery right next to it. So I was in surgery a few hours later, one plate for the lisfranc injury and one plate for the broken ankle. I had to go to the university in a borrowed electric wheelchair that stunk like cigarettes in lil shorts and exposed toes. Embarassing. Worst period of my life hands down. Worst part is Volkswagen was doing the diesel vehicle buyback and they offered me $21k for that car I paid $10k for, and I was 2 weeks away from finishing up the semester and was planning on not driving that car until they told me to take it to the dealership… I forgot to state the transmission work was shoddy and it basically fell apart on the loop and fucked up the brakes and thats what caused the accident."

"The upward tilt also solves for the problem of the rider's feet slipping off the front and rear of the footpads, causing falls and injury, as it positions the footpad decks at a net ten degrees opposite from each other allowing the riders feet to more firmly grip the footpad decks and prevent slippage off the front and rear of the one-wheeled electric skateboard."
"weightlifting is far more straightforward, especially with the newer, purpose built isolation machines that only move in one axis/rotation so that you basically cant fuck up the form. the advantage there is true isolation...if you need to strengthen your left minor oblong inner posterior glute longhead, theres probably some machine just for that. great for body builders trying to sculpt."

"Riding an electric scooter on a sidewalk, although widespread, is technically illegal in Toronto. This means that if ever anything were to come of this, your friend would be in the wrong."

Rentable scooters are convenient but they would be much less so if I had to carry a helmet around to ride one. People are obviously responsible for themselves but i feel like ones that anyone can ride inevitably lead to more injuries.

"Even though it’s only small amounts, any object/creature within the hex would be directly affected (it doesn’t only draw ambient heat)? If realism is desirable, considering the effects on movability could be worthwhile. Movement is heat, cold is retardation, rapid retardation is a crash, the level of rapidity is affected by the initial speed. I don’t know exactly how much it would take, but if I’m for example in the middle of a tall drop on skateboard, and my body loses a little bit of heat just before the landing, I imagine that could mess things up quite a bit. Either the legs are simply too stiff to absorb the shock, or the sudden change in movability, even a tiny one, could cause me to miscalculate and miss the landing, suddenly the ground hits me sooner than expected."

I wouldn’t want to ban them.  I mostly bike to work but am riding a scooter at the moment due to an injury.  Mine will do ~30kph… so slower than me on a bike.  Accelerates much more slowly as well.  I think in that range they are fine.  They should follow same rules as bikes (yes I follow those rules because I’m not a dingleberry with a death wish). I like having the option when my body just isn’t having it on the bike and it’s MUCH nicer than the TTC.
One of my friends was riding an E-scooter and got into a collision. She’s been in and out of a boot for over a year because of the damage the accident did to her foot. She’s had to have two surgeries so far and it still isn’t over. You couldn’t pay me to get on one of those.
"I don't know what you expect with so little information, but the market opportunity can usually be tested with a small subset experiment. Point being you think about what you were offering then try to break out the smallest element or facet you can test. This is the essence of Lean Startup and the point of the stupid diagram with the car and then a sequence of a skateboard, bike, motorcycle and finally a car. Nobody can figure that book out at all and pretty much all of them crash and burn. The principle is sound however."

"Ich habe jetzt nichts schriftliches schau dir aber mal die Bilder des Antriebstranges an. Die Batterie mit Achsträgern und eATS  ist quasi die bodengruppe, auf die die Karosserie aufgesetzt wird. Das ""skateboard"" kann theoretisch ohne Karosserie fahren. Die Batterie ist tragenden Teil des gesamten Fahrzeugs, ist aber aus crash Gründen so konstruiert, dass sie die Kräfte seitlich ableitet und so die Hauptzelle der Batterie, also da wie alle zellblöcke drin sind, intakt bleibt. Hab am Anfang einige crash dummys aufgebaut, weiß daher ein klein bisschen wie das ding funktionieren soll :)"
"The reactions in my circle of friends varied widely. The Germans mostly shrugged and went on with their day - they knew that their kids would know what to do if approached by a stranger, and that the actual danger to them was negligible. The American parents on the other hand went into a mad frenzy, strategising about whom they could carpool with, relating stories they had heard about from other places, comparing GPS tracking devices for their children, and fretting about whether it was even safe to let their children walk to their friends' house down the street."

"The bigger problem to worry about is going to be Stock Car Boy’s vehicle constructs. Able to control 4 units at a time that have B Speed and Power, it won’t bode well for us to be hit. Already, Winona will have turned a number of cars into gel, making them unsavory for use, as well as several objects at the pit station. In spite of this, it is still best to have a plan for dealing with these vehicles. On Ravee’s end, it will be much like how she deals with SCB itself, using her ability to reflect attacks back at the vehicles and wreck them all over again due to their durability. High-powered car projectiles will be reflected rather than destroyed, in case they secretly hide a truckload of bullets or shrapnel."
"Skateboarding was closely tied to punk from around 1978 to 1991 and to some extent 1991-1992. Wasn't always like that and it wasn't all genres of punk but mainly US hardcore punk and thrash/crossover, even darby crash from the germs was posing as a skater in the late 70s. Although I only remember the late 80s as kid and observer, generally speaking if you did deep enough you would find new wave, thrash metal, goth, psychobilly and even alternative rock fans or people at least dressing the part who were casually into skateboarding which isn't the same today, of course skaters can listen to anything but it didn't attract as many alternative subcultures after the 80s. Metallica had their own skateboard line in the mid 80s, it wouldn't be odd to look like street punk and skateboard back then either."

"I recently got in an accident that broke my exway flex deck into two. Everything else works perfectly fine except the board is now split in two pieces. I'm hoping someone in this subreddit has changed the decks on their exway flex before and can walk me through how to replace the deck. As for replacement deck options? I've been doing some research online and so far, the loaded vanguard board is the closest to what my exway deck was like. Except it doesn't seem to have the flares (or arches? I'm not sure what they're called) where my feet would rest on the board. I especially like that board design as it provides really good grip for manoeuvrability and turning. I'm not quite sure the loaded vanguard has this. My second issue with the vanguard is that it doesn't have the 'well' in the middle of the board that the cable runs through and Im not sure how to drill it into the new board without destroying it."

"You'll need a press and a set of dies. These might be found on craig's list (where I got mine) or at garage sales. Also, those CL/garage sale finds often include dies and tooling, so they really are my go-to recommendation. You probably don't need a spoopy-doopy Hornady Lock-n-Load Auto Progressive Press with the 5-station turret, as a simple single-stage like an RCBS Rock Chucker can do the same thing, but... if you do find a good deal on a used, working progressive... well, go for it? It takes a little bit more time with a single-stage is all, but an upgrade is an upgrade, ya know? There's also the option of something like the ~$50 Lee Classic ""press"" set which only requires a rubber mallet. I've heard good things and bad things about those though. Depending on how you go about things, you might need a manual priming solution, or whichever parts are needed to fit whichever press you get."
"Those referring to the victim as ""vehicular traffic"" are clutching at straws looking for a reason to blame the victim further. The fact the dude was rolling along on his bike at walking pace contributed nothing to this incident.  This crash could have happened if the victim had been walking his bike/trolley/skateboard/pets/children. When we focus on what the victim could have done differently, incidents like these will repeat themselves forever.  When we focus on what created a situation that was dangerous, then we can act to eliminate, reduce, or otherwise address the danger."

There's a lot of really great detail in the article. Here it is bulleted out for those who don't want to read through it:
"I have seen enough people asking advices for their ollies on day one, or even week one, on this sub. Riding a skateboard is hard, it's the most important and underrated trick. Pushing, carving, stoping. Repeat. Enjoy. Go everywhere, feel free. You are now a skater."
Recommend bringing a skateboard or bike. Only bring a skateboard if you are an above average skater though because you will be dodging people and going up and down hills. I’ve seen many crashes lol

I ran a kitchen for about 8 years. I've been through a lot of this stuff you're talking about.
"Children are taught to manage danger and risk as opposed to avoiding it. For example, children as young as three will be taught to light candles and to cut their food with (increasingly sharp) knives. My four-year-old can already use a proper kitchen knife when she's helping me make dinner (although I certainly wouldn't let her use it by herself). If the kids get a small cut or a burn it's not a big deal, it will heal, and it will teach them how to handle these objects and situations, as opposed to simply being taught not to approach them in the first place (""learn how to make fire safely"" vs ""don't play with fire"")."
A 30mph collision is quite serious (10% pedestrian fatality rate); a 40mph collision is spectacularly serious (50% pedestrian fatality rate).
"I will say I had wanted more of an insight into how she feels about Anna’s passing than we really get, but this time around I did think the scene where she sets the cat on the mother rat protecting her babies, as if because she had “failed” to do this she can’t bear to see the rat make a go of it, did provide more of a glimpse than I gave credit for at first. So, there’s hardly a sour note to the film at all, full marks. This last thought I have is a bit random but one I always have relating to Three Colors Blue that I'd like to share is having my money on Julie hating Believe by Cher viscerally and throwing something whenever it comes on, and it always makes me laugh. I can see that chorus playing just terribly to someone exactly like her."
"Thinking about it, I’m looking at the “ground clearance is a problem” and am wondering whether people are trying to make their Ventkids-endorsed skateboard compete with a low-orbit ship killing flying machine by charging all over the roughest of terrain at max speed and crashing into everything"
but the actual accident itself wasn’t the worst part. it was bathing after. the day after the crash my mom had to bathe me (talk about humiliation). she had to actually SCRUB my road rash EVERYWHERE. i couldn’t use my left arm at all obviously but i also couldn’t use my right hand because my palm was mangled. i will never forget crying from pain butt ass naked on the shower floor with fresh wounds all over my body while my mother scrubs it all with a loofah and dial antibacterial hand soap.
I'm still training my muscle memory to lean back and squat low while breaking to add to keeping the rear tire on the ground for the inevitable time when I'm going to have to break as fast as possible.

E-scooter riders won't be covered under home insurance because e-scooters are illegal – which I fully agree they shouldn't be.
Absolute piece of shit injuring that kid. I get that Skateboarding can be a slight nuisance but most skaters are generally respectful and also don't want to crash into anybody or break anything. This man straight up assaulted a kid because he was going for a trick where he shouldn't be. If you want kids off your property just have the police tell them to go. It's not a crime.
Also a friend went on his 125cc scooter to buy something to a nearby shop. It was summer so he went on tshirt. In a roundabout like 2mins from our place there was sand or something on the road and he fell going 50Kmh. You can't imagine how bad the rash was.

"I knew a guy who was hungry after a party in college but knew he was too drunk to drive. So he rode his electric scooter down to a drive through. The folks at the drive through called the cops because he obviously drunk. When the cops came to talk to him he said ""I know I'm drunk and that's why I rode this down here instead of driving because this way if I crash I'm only hurting myself.""  The cop ended up putting his scooter in the trunk and gave him a ride home, and didn't even give him a ticket."

Poor guy will never live down that scooter accident
It’s an electric skateboard and yes it has a speedo and I fell almost immediately a dog ran in front of my skateboard (don’t worry the dog is fine only a minor injury) and I didn’t even have time to react and because the dog took out my legs my upper body flipped around sending my shoulder and torso into the floor very quickly and I don’t really care too much about accuracy I just wanted an estimate of how much force was needed to fracture my shoulder
It’s all twisted.

"i didn’t let my youngest son play football because i didn’t want him injured. i was working a saturday sports med clinic at the time.  when he was 7 y.o. he was at the high school game, he and his friends were playing and one of them jumped on his back as he was climbing a hill - when they brought him to me he told me  “my ankle bends, but not where its supposed to!”. ( tib-fib fx). when he was in 9th grade attending the homecoming game i got a call from a paramedic to tell me that ‘because of the speed the car was traveling at, and the distance he was thrown they were transporting to hospital- but there was no sign of head injury, he’s alert, oriented x3.’.  he had callled me and handed the phone to the emt with no explanation after he was hit while crossing the highway to the high school for the game. you need to do what you think is right because you will live with the decision but - its not that easy to protect your kids. side note- when ER doc asked how he was able to survive the impact he said “ tuck and roll”. i did let him skateboard and it appears that the muscle memory of hundreds of falls from his board helped him escape more serious injuries when he was hit by a vehicle going 45 mph."

"With the cheaper models, they may be slower but they're also more portable, cheaper to replace. You might pass on them initially because they don't compete with a car or motor scooter, but without full motorcycle gear you may not want to after your first low speed crash. They shake hard and are pretty unstable at higher speed, aren't very visible to traffic, and the higher speeds make sidewalks a firm no-go because a pedestrian, stick or crack will dump you."
"Only once did I perform a hat trick of having 3 independent encounters where I got laid in the same day.  Started the morning in bed with a girl who I had broken up with a few months prior.  Went home and got invited over to another girl's house to watch Requiem for a Dream and we ended up having sex in the shower.  On my way home from there a girl I had just met recently messaged me saying she got kicked out of her home and needed a place to crash, so I picked her up from a random plot of undeveloped desert to go back to my house and we ended up having sex at home (she was just as much of a train wreck of a human as I suspected from that night).  I had run out of condoms because I wasn't expecting such a busy day so I had to go to my sister's room and ask her boyfriend if he had any with him."

"The construction company is not going to sue your friend. It's doubtful he did any damage to the hose, and if he did, they'll just go through insurance. Their recording is more injury/accident reporting; any incident of any magnitude needs to be recorded and documented in detail on a modern site. They're probably seeking a statement to close out the incident and ensure they don't have to deal with a lawsuit from your friend."
"The only thing that's more stupid than riding your scooter into an oncoming car from behind an object, is speeding away from an accident your involved in but not at fault for"
I have a lot of friends who have had surgeries for injuries to their legs because I play roller derby. Almost all of them were instructed by their surgeon to try to walk within 24 hours. One of them got married. One of them had a trip to China planned and didn't cancel it. She visited the Great Wall on het knee scooter.
"Yep. I don't have any experience with skateboarding, but I freeski which is probably similar in terms of risks + tricks. Not gonna lie, at 15-16ish I had a phase where I also thought that helmets are super uncool. I'm so glad that my dad forced me to wear one because now that I'm older and at least a little wiser, I realize that there is absolutely no reason to risk your life for completely shallow reasons!! I've seen a helmet break - without the helmet, that person probably wouldn't be alive anymore. There will always be moments where even the most skilled athletes will crash without any control. YTA, OP."
Watch some crashes on YouTube to see what happens to unprotected riders going fast when they crash.  Hurts just to watch!

"If you've already been travelling by electric skateboard you should already understand the limiting factors of commuting via PEV.-Ill-advised to ride in rain even if you add your own sealant, but can be done-Winter can be an absolute pain, but these things do fairly well in snow-Limited carrying capacity-Increased risk to yourself and property (say you slide carrying your laptop to class)-Portability (While EUC's are extremely portable, you might find it harder on a massive Veteran Sherman VS something like an Inmotion V8/10 etc)"
"I just want to state 2 points. I live in America, so things may be different here, but my electric scooter has a throttle, and 3 speed options. In the speed options I can hold the throttle half way down to not go as fast. Second off, due to physics and center of gravity on electric kick scooters, using hand signals just isn't safe. Hand signals work on bikes since they are more stable, but you have to fight constantly to make sure the electric kick scooter stays upright. Although that might just be due to me being a novice at the scooter, but I had way more luck hand signaling on a bicycle than an electric kick scooter."
"Fortunately for Tesla, the Bolt using pouch cells is far more difficult to produce, and the fault tolerance is far less. Also, fire prevention isn't implemented on those batteries, like a Tesla has."
"First of all, when I see an ebike driver, I generally don't see much in the way of protective equipment. Even on smaller motorcycles and scooters it is somewhat idiotic to wear basically just Jeans and a helmet, as it isn't that uncommon to get in an accident in which the difference is between good equipment and a pin in their hip for the rest of their life. I also maybe see a basic front fork suspension and occasionally some suspension on the rear of ebikes, but those are generally the ones that a lot were spent on (in my mind, basic motorcycle money). This level of suspension isn't a big deal on a bike that is maybe going at 30mph top speed, but if you start going over that the risk of injury goes up exponentially, just by something like hitting a rock in the road. You could beef up the suspension, but that would cause the bike to weight more and in turn require more work on the frame, and when you get that far you are basically talking about a scooter or motorcycle. The easiest solution is to better define the lines between an ebike and an electric motorcycle, which are currently not the most clear."
"Haha excuse me for wearing motorcycle gear to ride what is legally classified as a motorcycle. It travels 60mph, skateboard gear ain't gonna cut it for that. Would much rather die in a skydiving accident than a road accident. 🤣"
Really good books.
"The all-encompassing point of the movie appears to be that no man is an island, we can’t live on bread alone, all that.  Julie’s decision to self-isolate is a reflex more than outstanding desire to do so. If that was the case everything would be peachy keen, but I’ve long felt anybody that responds to personal tragedy or any setback this way doesn’t really mean it when they say they no longer want the company of people. It’s more that they no longer know how to be among people, and this is a frightening thought than one that’s easy to confront. I believe the movie backs this up. It will be a slow process but Julie accepting Olivier finally (Who does seem like a decent enough fellow to me, though I can understand if some won’t like him for the whole tracking her down maneuver), along with making peace with Patrice’s mistress and forming a meaningful connection with her ostracized neighbor Lucille, means she should be okay and life won’t be over for her just because her family is gone."

"The only thing in this family that ticks me off if I see it in car-free spaces or bike infra is the really souped-up heavy duty e-scooters that seem to max out at 35 mph or even more on a downhill. I've seen that on the Greenway and in Central Park, and it just just doesn't belong there. That's some obnoxious bullshit, just a matter of time before there's a really gruesome crash. (Also illegal under the 2020 law, escooters legal under the law are supposed to have the assist cut out at 15mph.)"
"The only warning I'd give anyone about using a wheelchair/scooter, is that while it's great to avoid boom and bust cycles, try to make sure you are still doing whatever walking you can (emphasis on whatever you can- no forced walking) without crashing. Before I got my scooter I used to do occasional walking (literally a few minutes here and there), it wasn't sustainable and I could walk so little I couldn't really get anywhere, but the alternative was staying in the house. When you get a chair you can get pretty much anywhere without walking at all, which is amazing and freeing. However, fitness does decline quite quickly, so when I first got my scooter I did notice a period where my actual fitness and strength felt lower. Hard to tell if it was just my condition getting worse as my fitness did improve eventually which took very minimal strength/fitness exercises, and it might have been caused by something different, like changes in medication during that time. However, I believe that while people with CFS can to some extent gradually improve their baseline by very carefully reducing sensitivity to certain tasks, I also think that we can to some extent reduce our baseline if we completely eliminate certain tasks that we could manage beforehand."

"But the essence of working with the stats is calmness. You can do this if you are prepared to be slow and measured. Quite literally. Find out your stats, your TDEE, your BMR, work out how many calories you need to eat to maintain your weight, work out what that is minus 500 calories or so to create a deficit. It’s slow, calm, slightly boring maths day after day. It’s a completely different animal from crash and burn diet tactics if you let it be."
Skaters didn't really listen to rap until Public Enemy came out. They were signed to Def Jam which is the same label that also had the Beastie Boys and Slayer. Rick Rubin introduced punk skaters to metal and bad ass angry hip hop.

Somehow you're only allowed to go 20 km/h on an e-scooter but if you have the money (i dont) for a fast e-bike (Speed Pedelec) you're allowed to go 45 km/h! But the problem is a Speed Pedelec is a shit ton more expensive than a similar speed e-scooter, it showcases these politician's are a bunch of out of touch rich people that can spend months and months or even a year (or more for some people like younger me) of income on a bike.

"I had to write a paper in English a while back about rental scooters. The takeaways were that a lot of people don't really understand how scooters work and that a terrifying amount of people don't wear helmets. People were eating shit at a depressingly high rate either due to lack of experience, traffic not yielding, or just straight up incompetence. I've kissed the sidewalk on my own scooter before by hitting a bump at an awkward angle and losing balance. My paper's sources detailed emergency room visit reasons and a fair amount were related to vehicle impacts (though whether it was the car or scooter at fault varies at random). I have personally witnessed multiple people riding rentals and just slamming into curbs at speed thinking they'll just go up said curb. They do not go up the curb, they flip and eat shit. It's pretty sad to watch. People who ride more powerful/capable scooters generally understand the limits of the vehicle better and the handlebars make balancing much easier. They also usually wear helmets, but not always. Conclusion: Assume they are about to crash into you and steer clear if possible, especially if they're on a rental and not wearing a helmet."
lower discharge rate (can go uphill longer for equivalent discharge)
"Cost: Of course, all this cost me more than 2 other options if we account for the new 3D printer and other electronic tools. However. just the components themselves (battery cells, filament, BMS and cables) cost me approximately $450 - $500. One can probably get away for less if you can find better deals for those components."
"We also legally have to wear helmets here, not allowed on sidewalks (But I mean if there's no one on the sidewalk I may go there temporarily if the road is looking rather horrendous), and have a 20 MPH (I think 35 kmh?) speed limit."
I don’t want to be that guy but a hockey/skateboard/football helmet is not designed to crash with your bike. Use a regular road helmet.
"I took a spill  on an electric scooter (with a helmet on thankfully) and I was crazy sore the next day. My only apparent injury was a bruised, scraped knee, but I felt sore for days."
Question 5: Is there anything else that I should take into account before starting this adventure of learning downhill? Any specific techniques that I should learn? Should I give it more time before trying this? Any general tips and tricks?
"I believe you can hit 50K miles on a Sherman, but you'd probably have to ride slow (20mph) or swap the batteries which could be ~1/2 the cost of a Sherman"
"Although I believe in that, I live in a tropical country, and the only gear I ALWAYS wear are helmet, gloves, and non-motorcycle-but-somehow-rugged-and-ankle-covering hiking boots. During Summer, I often use these with ""highly protective"" cargo shorts and t-shirts. Whenever it's not too warm, I use a proper motorcycling jacket, but regular jeans."
"Difference is, they don't post about it often. But if you look forums, and strava data, it's a super common thing"

"I believe that it’s the panic and the wanting the weight to be gone now that has led a lot of us into crash dieting and drastic measures that can’t succeed long term. I have certainly jumped into a diet craze desperate for this one to work, fallen off it the way I would fall off a skateboard, and ended up feeling worse and more hopeless each time."
IMO the bigger change will be flat floors as they can cut the transmission/driveshaft tunnel and just put the passenger compartment on top of the skateboard and have hub engine.
"Since the majority of us were middle class at best, plus broke because college & only able to work shit hours at our shit jobs, he would often buy things with the collective fun of our group in-mind."
"With bicyclists, the cons are you can't go as fast, you have no weather protection, you need to buy and wear extra gear for safety (Glasses for bugs and harsh weather to protect eyes, helmet to make sure your head doesn't crack like an egg, and pads so your knees, elbows, and wrists will be better off in a crash, and locks in hopes the bicycle won't be stolen), they also are way easier to be stolen, and very dangerous since cars either can't or won't look out for them, and many states will not allow them on sidewalks at least in busy areas legally."
"All three probably. For recumbent pedal bikes, it's hard to justify spending 5-10k on something that is purely designed to go fast in a straight line. The only reason manufacturers sell as many TT bikes as they do is triathlon, and a recumbent is kind of an even more extreme version of a TT."

Conclusion
"In a motorcycle, when compared to squid riders, I'm above average"
"- Folding e-bikes are probably a good middle ground.  I never liked normal folding bikes because they seemed too much of a compromise in terms of speed, but folding e-bikes basically remove the speed compromise.  They are more compact than normal e-bikes, and they can fold into a smaller shape (though that shape is more of a cube than a narrow shape).  Plus, like all e-bikes, they allow you to assist with pedal power when going up hills.  The downside is that they are still slower than non-folding e-bikes (though not as bad as normal folding bikes vs non-folding bikes), and the folding mechanism may be a chore to fully fold & unfold."
"I have never slowed down since my teen years, and I'm going to keep going until I can't anymore."
I’m told he was involved in a crash while riding his scooter and never recovered.
For those who want more details:
"So, yeah, it can save you money. Especially if you REALLY scrounge around for the cheapest tools and supplies. Or you can not deal with it and cough up $29 every now and again."
"There have been lighter moments as Torres has introduced some new games and activities during the warm-up (not all ball-based), but there is also a clear push to improve the player’s fitness levels. That Barca’s players have not trained as hard as those at other clubs has become accepted wisdom over recent seasons, with many stories shared of sessions being cut short or designed not to overly tax veteran players, including Lionel Messi, during the regimes of Valverde, Quique Setien and Koeman."
It all turned very corporate after that. Skating sort of died out until the Tony Hawk game came out which seriously revived the scene especially after stuff like X-Games and Warped started.
"Because of this, the car had to be crash-worthy even without the battery pack in place, which meant the frame was a lot heavier than it could have potentially been if the battery pack were part of the structure. This is what Elon meant by the structural pack having ""negative weight"". Switching to the new design allowed them to reduce the weight of other parts of the car because the pack could start taking over some of the duty of providing rigidity and strength to the body."
"20kph+ crash with no protection be it scooter, bike or skateboard and you are in with a good chance of ending up in the ""forever box""."
"Ted: I don't believe you. Look, James, if you sell that thing you're basically saying that person's life is worth less to you than fifty bucks."
"😱“SPOILER ALERT: I will be the one to assassinate the President just before his televised address, unless you do exactly what I say next!"""
"A couple of thoughts, sure."
"The less you carry, the happier you will be - trust me on this. Get an ultralight backpack, not one of those metal-framed monstrosities you could carry two pigs and a toddler in.  You really truly do NOT need all that junk you are carrying, and that thing will be an albatross. Invest in 3-4 pair of quick-dry pants and shirts - underwear and socks too - some Keen fisherman sandals, a LIGHTWEIGHT rain jacket and a polyfleece pullover just in case you go up into the mountains someplace.  That is seriously all you need. Nobody is looking at your clothes so you don't need to be a fashion plate. Get a bungee laundry line and hand wash your clothes in the sink every few days when you come back to the hostel to crash (they may even have washer/dryer setups)."
it's not? lel. do a frame by frame analysis and compare it to irl footage of cars in a highway.
Basically there’s morons on the road everywhere.
"Also, deliberately pushes his (possibly rental) scooter under the BMW in order to provoke an accident."
Here's the exceptions to the above list:
"Absolutely TERRIBLE experience with the MEEPO V3, so I've spent $600 for an unusable electric skateboard that falling apart. Biggest problem is they are in a foreign country and won't accept returns or replace a totally defective product. I bought a V3 in late August 2021 for a very gentle commute around a college campus. When I finally got it, I loved it for the first 3 weeks/50 miles, then the right rear wheel started suddenly grinding and vibrating, totally reducing the speed. I immediately sent picture showing the grinding marks in the hub, along with all the metal/magnetic shavings filling up the inside. Tried customer service numerous times, with both the chat and numerous emails and jumped through all their hoops of sending endless photos and videos and sound recordings. Even crashed and separated my shoulder and sprained an ankle trying to get the video with sound they demanded. They eventually sent motors and sleeves several times, and I kept replacing what they suggested BUT IT NEVER SOLVED THE PROBLEM. Then they just started saying ""there's nothing wrong"". The vibration is so bad it actually moves my foot on the decking! I couldn't ride it for 4 MONTHS during the warrantee back-and-forth while endlessly waiting for answers and parts. After Christmas I just gave up and decided to ride it and keep replacing the motors with the ones they sent and extras I had bought originally (because I believed I would have it for a long time and wanted spare parts) and let them fill with dust and grindings while only that one wheel/sleeve/motor has a problem. So I have about 250 miles total on it from riding 3 weeks in September and then 4 weeks in February and part or March and have been through 5 motors with lots of vibration, grinding, and less than 1/2 top speed potential. And now the whole (bamboo) deck is cracking right down the middle above the battery pack. I can see into the interior of the board through the crack! Terrible product, terrible customer service, a rip-off because they are in a foreign country so you can't even return the defective product for replacement or refund after receiving it! I even suggested I send/deliver it one of their contacts in the US or I that I would send a video of me totally destroying it to prove I wasn't trying to get an extra board. THEY NEVER FIGURED OUT THE PROBLEM, NEVER FIXED THE BOARD, NEVER GAVE MY MONEY BACK, AND NEVER SENT A REPLACEMENT."
"Whatever you choose, stick with the following rules:"
"This case is less than a year old, but I'm guessing Bird is not seeing liability in this case.  I suppose the business model wouldn't really work if they had to insure every rider."
"I haven't had an orgazm post injury and it is one of the most devastating things about this injury since my sex drive now is  almost the same as before the injury. There's nothing I can say other than I feel your pain, it sucks."
"Drum brakes have too long of a pull, mushy lever, and feel uncertain.  But they work.  Learning to transition from electric to drum brake as a panic stop unfolds is going to require dedicated practice.  Having three working brakes instead of one half-ass disc is such a great upgrade where I live."
"You can ride a motorcycle in extreme weather, but there's issues. Winter weather means a significant decrease in safety (unless you go to three-wheel motorcycles, which are bad for space utilization). Rainy weather means you're getting wet (same is true of a bicycle, but not public transport). Hot weather means that people will want to wear lighter garments, which means a significant decrease in safety. (And, safety garments increase the workload of getting ready to go somewhere, regardless of weather.) Of course, in the Asian countries that heavily use motorcycles to get around, ATGATT (All The Gear All The Time) simply isn't practiced, it's basically a helmet and that's it. (But, then, in a lot of these countries, speeds tend to be fairly low...)"
"the angled frame rails of this invention and disclosure lower the center of gravity at the contact points--i.e. a rider's feet on foot pad decks--by as much as possible without losing any clearance at the front and rear bumpers, and tilt the gyroscope to change the zero-degree level default position to five degrees"
"Now listen here, sweaty. Trump was responsible for the holocaust, the Armenian genocide, WW2, the Korean war, the Vietnam War, 9/11, the Arab Spring, the Crusades, the Islamic invasion of Spain, the formation of Israel, he was also responsible for driving the Jews out of Israel in the first place,in fact the Egyptians did nothing wrong; it was Trump who was responsible for enslaving the Jews. Trump is secretly a scaly and one day while he was wearing his snake suit he tricked Eve and told her to eat the apple. He also killed Abel. He also lead the Mongol invasions of everywhere. And the Hun invasions. And the Mughal invasions of India. And the Viking invasions.Trump was the guy who started colonialism(only the invading part not the part where they provided technology and medicine to the natives). After Trump tested positive for Covid19, he spit on Native Americans, nearly driving them extinct. Trump also killed all the dinosaurs. He was also behind the Bronze age collapse. Trump single-handedly did the Triangular Slave Trade; hell he was the guy Trump bought the slaves from. Trump also beheaded a French teacher for disrespecting Mohammad, and blamed it on wholesome Muslimerinos. All the blood diamonds are produced by Trump. He was the guy who cut Congolese workers hands off because they did not meet his supply. Trump chased Kyyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha with a skateboard and beat him up and snatched his rifle, and used it to kill Jacob Blake. During the BLM protests Trump was the one who looted and burned all the stores. Even during the Charolletsville incident, they were all shadow-clones of Trump. Trump did Pearl Harbor and bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Trump was the mastermind of the Holodomor, the Great Leap Forward, East Germany and every time a tankie screams ""It was not real communism"", Trump was involved. Trump grilled the last dodo. Trump shoots Palestinian kids for fun and shoots missiles at Israeli civilians. He was the guy who killed all those Rohingyas, and Uyghurs. He was also involved the current Hong Kong situation; so much involved that he was the one who sold opium to the Chinese. The Irish potato famine, Africa, the Bengal Famine; all because of Trump. Trump commits human rights violations on North Korean citizens everyday. Al Qaeda, Mujaheddin, Boko-Haram, Taliban; TRUMP. He also killed the prophet of the wholesome 100 Muslimerinos, Sulemani; in a missile strike. He also did the Rape of Nanjing and it was Trump who ordered and supplied all the Korean comfort women. Trump personally snitched on Anne Frank to Trump. The Jim Crow laws were passed by Trump, as well as the war on drugs. The partition of India was Trump's fault, as well as the resulting Kashmir issue. He also starred in the Cuban missile crisis and started the cold war. During the Russian Revolution, the peasants understood that Nikolai II's family was innocent, and would offer them a chance to leave, but Trump massacred them. Trump tried his best but failed in preventing the American and French Revolutions, but he got back at them by causing the Reign of Terror. Trump tortured Louis XVI's son and forced him into saying that he had sex with his mother and aunt, and promptly guillotined them. Trump invented pineapple-pizza and Tofu-Chicken. He was the guy who snitched on Alan Turing, revealing that he was gay. The judge felt that such a respected professor could be sent away with a slap on the wrist, but Trump rigged the jury and sentenced him to hormonal therapy. Trump rigged the New York Stock Exchange and caused the great depression. In the town of Waco, he raped a woman, blamed it on a black man and lynched him by burning him alive. He was the leader of the Khmer Rouge and wrote the plot for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Despite making up only 3.0211238398812703164724804575659e-7 % of the population Donald Trump commits 100% of the crimes. Trump also was the dictator of Uganda. Trump regularly kills journalists and opposition leaders in Russia. He was behind Princess Diana's car crash. Trump fucked a monkey and started the AIDS pandemic. He started coronavirus and ebola and the Black Death and the Spanish flu and the Bubonic plague and the syphillis outbreak and the Trojan war and tthe Bush war and the fall of Rome and the Dark Ages. After taking a dump, Trump leaves his toilet paper like this. Trump burned down the Notre Dame, and knelled on George Floyds neck. He also was the guy who sold drugs to George Floyd. Trump is the reason I am the only person in my class who doesn't have a girlfriend. Trump is the reason why the Armenia Azerbaijan crisis is even there."
So that's the trade off. The scooter I'd heavy and harder to get up the shorts steps I have to regularly go up and down. Can't easily just pick up one end and tow it behind me like luggage like the Vsett 8 for instance. But it probably will be safer for me for fast stops and larger wheels can go over more things without running into the crashing problem.
"If you come to Armenia, don’t take taxis at the airport or really anywhere on the street directly. It’s always cheaper and safer to find one through Uber-like apps such as GG or Yandex Go."
What's this TSLA too expensive meme? At 2022 PE ~60  it's the bargain on the century.  I really struggle to understand why anyone would think it's expensive.
"Not wearing a helmet on your bike, skateboard, rollerblades? It's only YOUR head that will be mush."
"A)  Call a friend/family member that has a car to pick it up. B)  Have it delivered. C)  Strap a 80 pound tv on your back and ride an electric scooter where there is a great chance you're going to lose your balance and fall or crash on the way, yeah that's a fucking stupid idea to save 50 bucks."
"I've been skateboarding for years and fallen off a ton, but after buying an electric skateboard I haven't crashed yet because ironically I think they are safer. Mainly due to having complete control over speed via acceleration and braking."
"Eventually a electric cart with gardeners in it stopped and I asked if they could radio anyone. They couldn’t, the guy rode off against traffic again, just to “teach me a lesson” or something. The button to the end of the whole thing was the gardeners saying “this is our jobs all day everyday” the insanity and abuse due to the lack of enforcement. I apologized for involving them in another redic shouted conversation."
"That’s Canoo’s patented skateboard. Unlike Lordstown, Canoo’s skateboard is the first with structural battery packs and crash components built in (meaning bodies can be quickly developed and not subject to crash). Canoo is also the first to have steer-by-wire, brake-by-wire and HVAC components built into their skateboard."
This particular user had a crash recently which split open his Puck. Not sure if he bought a new one or just replaced the shell.
"Just Like in Tony Hawk! - Marissa initiates a divekick, but instead of blowing the guy’s face off, she’ll knock him to the ground and… ride him like a skateboard??? That’s right! Using the bevy of mines spread across the arena to steer, she’ll propel herself on her human skateboard, grinding off pews and frag ramps telekinetically held in the air. When she’s had her fun, she’ll kickflip off the man and send him flying with a blast to comically crater a wall."
Leaves changing colors.
"James: No, I'd already ordered one by the time they got there. Dude! Stop laughing! It was a harrowing experience!"
"Sources said a paperwork error led to the release of Troy Belnavis, 32, of the Bronx about 12:20 p.m."
"YTA. Keep your dog on a leash, first of all, unless you’re in an area where it’s permitted to let him off-leash. When you let him run loose, you put him and everyone else around in danger. He could run onto the road, or into the path of a bicycle/scooter/skateboard. He could knock small children over, or scare the ever-loving shit out of anyone who is afraid of dogs. He could walk over broken glass or something equally detrimental to his health, or eat something that could make him sick."
Yiu got this!👍
Here's a good metaphor.
"I saw two women on one electric scooter crash a few months ago. Weren’t holding on tight and it wobbled and scooter went out to the side. One in front hit the pavement and went still. Scary shit honestly, she woke up but ambulance came and took her on a stretcher."

"Skateboard fashion in the 80s is influenced by hardcore punk to some extent with flannels, converse and spiky short hair as are skateboard graphics with artists like pushead who designed lots of skateboard art and lots of brands having a punk edge. Skateboard and hardcore bands being into skating was big then as well ex. JFA and Suicidal tendencies, and thrasher magazine compilations were mostly punk."
"Also this does not factor injury. But yeah, a high speed car crash is unsurprisingly a lot more deadly than falling on flat ground on a skateboard."
My eyes went wide and my heart stopped. Suddenly I grabbed the door handle and flung it open.
In the state of Virginia where I live you just can’t do that.
"The hotel chosen for the team to meet, eat together, rest in their rooms and then gather for the pre-game team talk was also a sign of the times around the club. Previously favoured was the Princesa Sofia, a five-star hotel close to the stadium which is also popular with players’ families and top agents, and where Real Madrid stay when they come to the city."
Organize the car well and leave yourself a predefined napping/sleeping space so you don’t have to rearrange everything when you’re tired

"As someone who frequently injure BOTH my ankles, and has traveled many times on crutches, with a knee scooter, etc my recommendation is DON'T. I permanently fucked up my ankles by not following medical advice and taking it easy when I should have, and will have lifelong issues now which will likely later result in my later years of me being in a wheelchair. So please pleas please take it easy and follow medical advice."
"Someone else told me that Elon nearly died in a motorcycle crash once, and don't touch motorbikes ever since. Don't know how true it is."
"Also, for all of this, I'm lumping mopeds and sit-down scooters in with motorcycles - read 50 cc as including mopeds in all of this. (Sit-down scooters span all classes from 50 cc to... I think Aprilia has a 850 cc one?) Fundamentally, it doesn't matter much whether your 50 cc has pedals and a centrifugal clutch or CVT (moped), a flat floor and a CVT (scooter), a step-through frame and a manual transmission (underbone), or a step-over frame and a manual transmission (traditional motorcycle) for this discussion."
"When he woke up, it was around 5:30 a.m. or so, the sun was coming out, and there was a person who woke him up. He asked him if he was okay. The person told him that he found him laying on the footpath besides his scooter. He asked him whether he met with an accident or something. My friend's uncle looked around, and bite mark wounds on his Thigh and calves. He had bled, but it was dry now (the blood had clotted already). He found scratches on his helmet, and some damage to the scooter."
"My friend just told me I can find a used boosted deck as it already has the cable 'well' already in it and in some cases, comes with the cables. I'm just not sure if they'd be compatible with the ESC of my exway. If anyone has any help or advise I'd really appreciate it. I love in the UK if that's of any help. Thanks in advance guys."
I’d be most pissed off at being told “you have to come home” for a bumper that can be fixed with a basketball. (Or any minor accident). And what is “like a boss” about this? The ski scooter? The high maintenance wife?

"If you want to find an apartment for short-time rent, you can use List.am. It’s a local website for all kinds of ads and it has more options that international websites like AirBNB. It can be cheaper, too. The website itself has an English menu, but some of the ads are in Armenian only, so you might need to use Google Translate."

"Electric bikes and scooters have been deliberately held back, is my inescapable conclusion, by the automotive lobby complex."
I see in the comments what you refuse to accept as an answer. I'm not going to get into a debate on that topic when you won't hear it. The thing to do is provide for the assumption you made and test it cheaply as possible.
Face paint.
"Did I manage to go on my long rides with my girlfriend? The answer is Yes. In fact, because of the uphill improvements, the Onewheel handled the hills way better than the scooter and was able to last longer. At the end of the ride, I was pushing the scooter while riding… fun times :)"
Skateboarding at night.
1986. I had this weird old school skateboard that someone gave me. I met these guys who had better skateboards. They invited me to come watch skate videos on VHS.

"At the gate, ask to be able to enter earlier due to your issues so you don't have to rush."
"What type of holiday? And where is it at? Big difference if you are just going for a few days and stay by the pool, but if this is a beach vacation and you are in a cast DON'T DO IT. I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating — and it gets everywhere. And a much bigger difference if say you are going to spend most of your time walking cobblestone streets of Europe, or the hills of San Francisco (this was my undoing.)"
"When I finally got in, there wasn’t an exhibition of new photos, a new installation, anything that I had expected, based on her previous work. Instead, it was a cramped room with two cashiers selling BK merch: skateboard decks, totes, beanies, that all said stuff like: “Want it. Buy it. Forget it.” in her signature style."
"Belnavis had been arrested in Manhattan on March 6 on low-level drug charges. He was also wanted by authorities in Galloway, N.J. near Atlantic City for absconding on a 2020 drug case there."
VISAS - use a visa service if you're going to Vietnam; it's like $80 inclusive of the visa fee and it is seriously worth it just to sit there in the airport while somebody else navigates the system for you.
"Sure, components are re-used in various places. But if the Skateboard platform was a thing, all Tesla would have identical castings, batteries, suspension. Especially considering the crash structure, there is just not a great way to treat the passenger compartment and chassis as interchangeable."
"And of course, also literally, to refer to wood."
Walking a dog outdoor for long enough distances is very physically taxing on crutches (not to mention unsafe if the dog is liable to pull) or using a manual wheelchair. Someone who is only recently injured is not likely to have the upper-body strength to do that for long enough distances. A powerchair or scooter is an option but then you’d think there’d be some mention of that as you’d need an accessible place to store and charge it.
"My cousin is in the middle of her medical residency and works in the emergency room. She said that the face surgeon never gets to go home on Friday or Saturday nights due to the number of electric scooter crashes that result in gnarly face injuries. Apparently people regularly fly over the handlebars and land right on their face. It was enough to make me never want to ride one. Glad your injury wasn’t as traumatizing. Still a bummer, sorry you are going through it!"

"Last summer I was skating down in an alley. I kind of disassociated while skating. I didn’t even have to push myself forwards to skate, it was just rolling and rolling. Meanwhile I disassociated I didn’t realize that the alley I was rolling on was tilting more downwards and even more downwards. I noticed a dead end too, and when I came back to reality, I realized I was skating so fast and I had no idea how to stop in my tracks. I was panicking so hard because I put my foot down 3 times and it got scraped by the ground so hard, I knew it was gonna end up bad. I didn’t wanna crash into the dead end so I jumped off the skateboard (I had no idea what to do, I was still a beginner skater) and I rolled like 10 times, scraped my left hip, and landed on my right arm. Luckily I had gear on, but I still have complications with my right arm til this day…"

"I'm going to be on the side of positive intent here. We don't know when the bottom could be. And we don't know how fast things will recover.  I'd like to thing what /u/maybesomaybenot92 is saying with ""be patient"" is ""manage your risk"". Take a look at all the cash you have on hand, create a plan for what your average down strategy looks like, and then align your risk profile to the volatility in the market.  For example, if you had $10k, and you feel like some of the companies you're looking at are still over valued, but they're at a more reasonable valuation (ie. lets say TSLA). TSLA is still at a P/S of 20 and P/E of 300. Maybe you believe that this valuation is still high, but better than than the P/S of 30 and P/E of 450 it was at $1200. Given that, could it fall another 30% to $600? How do you think forecast will be? What is your guess on this? Based on that, you can go in with whatever % of your free cash you feel comfortable."
"Most of 90s skateboarding was leaning street and became mostly disconnected from hardcore punk and almost entirely hip hop influenced in some way. Your average street skater in 1993 was looking more like a nu metal kid with baggy phat XXXL  khaki pants, goatees, sideways baseball caps, long baggy white shirts and puma sneakers than anything from punk subculture."
"I'm very sorry you have to deal with reckless people, but think how they would do in a car. I have seen so many people drink, text, and drive. If anything, it's scarier to think of someone that is that irresponsible in a car than a scooter. And I'm sure we have all seen our fair share of car crashes to know the consequences of their actions..."
There is a difference between being strict and being abusive and having a toxic mindset. Being strict means enforcing rules and instilling in your kid the importance of them. To get them to understand the importance- you teach them. You teach them WHY there are rules and WHY it's important to try to follow them to the best of your abilities. Not blindly getting angry whenever your kid does something wrong.
"Most objects that cause a crash are in front of you, so I wouldn't fixate on peripheral vision. The bicycle and motorcycle helmet standards all require a pretty respectable field of view (it's supposed to provide unobstructed vision, at least if you look ahead), and that's fine for EUCs."
EDIT: The lawyer quoted in this article seems to think drivers hitting e-scooters will be held responsible by default - much like for hitting other more vulnerable road users.
"TL;DR: I dont think the problem is that we arent telling people to wear gear enough. we definitely are. the main problem (imo) is that people underestimate how dangerous it is to be ejected off of a skateboard at 30~ mph. they think a helmet is fine, because they dont realize just how dangerous a fall can be. we need to educate new riders on not only the importance of gear but also the true dangers of a fall."
Every brilliant thing:
"The same kind of gag happens with the giant fist/skateboard, or going back to the TV show the Easter bunny / Santa suit stuff. These sight gags act as bumper segments to break up the bigger, longer narrative segments."
"Long story short, wear your helmet. If you think it'll inhibit your ability to get laid or whatever, just put cool band stickers on it & write ""I CRUSH PUSS ON THE REGS BRO"" on it w/ silver sharpie."
"Has anyone had experience with this or other motorcycle/personal injury settlements? 33% sounds like a lot, but it's hard to judge when you have no idea what value a lawyer could bring. And considering 33% would come out of the medical bills you owe, it seems like there is some level where you'll actually get less money by having a lawyer due to contingency.  But if having a lawyer gets you significantly more money from insurance than it would be worth it. But you don't know if it's worth it until you've agreed to it."
"Yerevan has decent and cheap bike and electric scooter sharing systems, but don’t expect the city to have the relevant infrastructure. Unfortunately, so far there’s only a handful of bike lanes downtown and they’re short. Car traffic on the main roads can be quite chaotic, so it’s safer to bike/scoot on the sidewalks, just try not to crash into pedestrians and you’ll be fine."
For an example -- since there's no telling what you're going on about -- everybody who has ever put a pot on a stove right-side-up figures they can launch a successful sit-down restaurant. That's batshit crazy.

When I was initially doing my research another brand that stuck out was Apollo. A few of those babies can go up to 40mph! I'm not certain how good the quality is but if you're looking for speed you should check those guys out.

Why are you arguing about putting a helmet on a kid?
I think you should skip a suspension wheel for a first wheel although there’s a very good argument to say come back to that decision once you’re proficient and know the lay of the land a little better.  We have a guy on the heavier side in our riding group and he rides a Monster Pro seated for hundreds upon hundreds of miles.  Brings an EV charger with and an inflateable mattress and just chills while he charges.
"That's like a 9-10% difference from motorcycle injuries. Which kinda makes sense, since probably the average e-scooter rider has little experience with that kind of vehicle  and doesn't  know how to avoid or deal with risky situations compared to somebody who is merely walking or who has spent years riding a bike or motorcycle."
"It does not matter if it is electric, hydrogen or or made of gold. It takes up way too much space for the people it serves."
"In these conditions, all claims about potential ""unsafe"" aspects of lane sharing are, imho, moot. A bunch of people love to talk about car doors randomly opening, about cars randomly pulling out of driveways at full speed, about stopped cars trying to swerve out of their way to hit you, about the million and one dangers of lane-sharing, and use it as an excuse to say ""I would never do it and neither should you, it's DANGEROUS. When traffic is fully stopped and I'm going less than 10mph, Montana-law-style, I can and have avoided such pitfalls by just instantly stopping and rerouting."
"If you decide to follow my path, just make sure to spend the money on quality gear and educate yourself (YouTube is fucking awesome) on how to move in traffic and minimize your risk since you no longer have a big steel box insulating you from the negative health effects of yours and others around you doing dumb shit."
"""Investigators were “unable to locate any damages (dents, scuffs, scratches, etc. or any other physical evidence (clothing fibers, fingerprints, areas of skin oils transfer to the vehicle surface, etc. (sic) to either vehicle that indicated a collision occurred or a body rolled across the surface of the hood,” the report said."""

"remember to rest…rest is the single most effective thing you can to speed up your learning cycle.  Also, vary exercises.  Don’t do mounting/dismounting for an entire session.  Your brain will assimilate tasks faster if you vary the exercises per session (there’s research on this where the development of muscle memory is concerned).  Spend no more than an hour per session and stop if you get exhausted.  Your body needs time to consolidate all the new sensations and your muscles need time to recuperate.  As your brain builds those new pathways, you’ll find that the exercise you tried the day before that was impossible is a little less impossible today or in some cases, suddenly trivial."

"Now e-skating is still dangerous. And despite not falling for 3 years I still consider it WHEN I will fall rather then IF. But with these methods you can prevent 90% of the accidents you see here. I’ve had several close calls when on sketchy road conditions, changes of road surfaces etc. But my skills and not pushing boundaries beyond my means have always managed to save it."
"You'll need tools for case preparation, like a tumbler (wet or dry media) to clean the cases, measuring tools (calipers, gauges) and trimming tools for cutting the cases to length. There is a lot of wiggle room here. Aside from deals at garage sales, you could buy a top-of-the-line wet tumbler, or you could diy one with, like, a bucket, a skateboard, and a low-rpm electric motor. You could buy a fancy $250 shell trimmer station, or a $25 hand trimmer, or DIY with a cut-off wheel in a dremel and a plumber's pipe deburring tool (carefully, Bubba, carefully). You'll also need a primer pocket cleaner, which can be done with a small tool that costs anywhere from $5-$whatever and can be found on amazon. Be sure to donate to someone like FPC through the amazon smiles thingy if you go that route."

"Electric skateboards are not legal at all! (Surprised me too, I was under the impression that the 2020 NYS law that legalized e-bikes and stand-up escooters too covered lots of micromobility devices, but no.

"People were PISSED. Everyone thought they’d accidentally gone through the gift shop by accident. It turned out there was no new gallery installation, no new photos, nothing like any of BK’s previous work. Just two cashiers who were heckled non stop by everyone who came to see BK’s latest and greatest new work, only to find that there wasn’t one. The cashiers has to explain, over and over, that there wasn’t anything in the gallery. Just the tiny room selling upmarked BK merch that mimicked the type of stuff you’d find in a skateboard store, all of which offered her usual commentary on capitalism and consumer culture. A lot of people walked out angrily. I bought a beanie and a tote bag and was SO mad - my favorite artist, whose work I’d been waiting to see my whole life, had pulled this stunt."

"No one was taking photos 'surreptitiously'. Your friend injured themselves doing something outside of their liability through their work site. Taking photos is standard protocol to document things, record the state of the site, and ensure that the staging was done correctly. Also, your friend was in a public space meaning they don't have a legal expectation to privacy."
This is another reason for this sub. Reducing the number of pissed off drivers in traffic makes riding a motorcycle safer too. My only crash was when a taxi pulled out in front of me.
so which is which?
"As for electric, 200MPGe is a piece of cake. If you can do 25kph from 100W (a good road bike position can achieve that) you're getting about 5,200MPGe. The main issues are that it's hard enough producing an upright ebike for 2k, and many jurisdictions have restrictions on ebikes. In the UK an ebike is only allowed to have 250W and cannot provide assistance above 25kph, so it's hard to justify one over a scooter. If you built something much faster which required a license, it'd have to pass crash testing and stuff and you would basically have a Renault Twizy"
Tech skeptics (usually on the non-mainstream left) love characterizing legal arbitrage as if there are no good faith actors and it's just a pack of thieves and useful idiots. It's a problem because then they just perpetuate a status quo that everyone agrees is unacceptable.
You can ride as safe as you want but there will always be that one idiot in a car ending your riding career. Nearly every rider gets into an accident. Saw a scooter on the highway the other day get rear ended and EMTs were trying to revive the guy.

"I got in an accident on my moped/scooter last week. Guy was stated at fault for running a red light. I hit his car with my scooter than I *think* I had a little ride on his windshield before landing on pavement. I've gotten really ""lucky"" with my injuries with no broken bones or internal injuries. A LOT of deep bruising, muscle strains, bruised ribs, whiplash, etc. Some missed work and difficulty with movnig and daily tasks. Recommendations were to get with a lawyer but it  appears standard agreement is they will be taking 33% of whatever settlement."

"James: What the hell does that matter? If there's no scoot, it's not a scooter!"
"Goes to that first question, is the risk of that harm reasonably foreseeable. Then you would have to ask if the person did everything a reasonable person would do to mitigate that risk (helmet, pads, quiet spot etc). Finally if having done those steps what is the reasonable likelihood of risk."
"There's no real limits to them other than not going in the road, so it was pretty crazy sometimes, especially during busy commuting times or on weekends/evenings. And you can go pretty fast on them! The difference is though, the pavement in NZ are at least twice as wide as UK pavements, so there's usually quite a bit of room for scooters to get past. Here I imagine they could easily be a nuisance and cause a few accidents if they're allowed on pavements, and road accidents if on the roads! They could be allowed in cycle lanes maybe, but depends on the quality of the cycle lane"

A 1lb jug of powder is 7000 grains, and that figures to something like 140-ish rounds. That jug will also cost somewhere around $40 (according to the Hodgdon site). On a lark, you spent $80 dollars at the Winchester site and picked up 1000 large rifle primers. Assuming no errors or accidents (lol), those are good for, well, 1000 rounds. You also went to the same random reloading supply website I clicked and picked up a 100 count box of 165 grain Poly-tipped Spitzers for about $27."
"Or, as you apparently only just discovered, he could run at a dog who doesn’t like other dogs. Not every dog likes dogs, and it’s not something you can necessarily fix with training. These dogs still need to be exercised though, and their owners are well within their rights to take them out for walks so long as they take the proper precautions. Maybe that means a muzzle, or maybe it means warning people who approach that “hey, my dog isn’t very friendly to other dogs”. Also, another note: sometimes dogs who are friendly to other dogs just end up hating a particular dog for no reason. Just because Mack is friendly doesn’t mean he’ll like every dog he meets, and every dog he meets might not like him."
"The speed limits are thankfully low, so a car would be a much better idea."
Running fast with your dog.
"Rocket Punch! - Every time Errok takes his gauntlet off - it’s vulnerable. It’s high time to teach him why. Whilst he’s using his extendo-fist, Marissa launches frags at him with an explosion. These will hook inside the gauntlet itself, before SHOOTING it out of his grasp at A POW. He’ll be forced to chase after it, but every time his arms close in, an explosion will send them flying away, making him look like a silly goon! Every second he spends with his arm uncovered is one that’s taken from his three minute time limit. Once Marissa has had her fun, she sends the rocket fist careening right through Lomo’s chest, letting Errok fish it out of the corpse."
"Evidently the powers-that-be in San Francisco feel that street-level cops are using the above as ""fishing expeditions"" to pick on Blacks and minorities, and thus want to take away that potential. Instead, people can do any of the above pretty much at will, and maybe the cops will send you a ticket in the mail."
"It's pretty precious to be worried about the impact of these things on footpaths while accepting the death toll, infrastructure cost, and environmental burden of cars."

"If we were to have smart scooters and more powerful e-bikes, and raise the speed limit to the residential one, the conversion to low cost personal transportation would be accelerated as it was in China and almost overnight our cities would be nicer. The transition would take only a few years."
"Spot welding is more precise. It hold perfectly have less chance of being shorted after a crash. If you soldering it that minimal touch with great soldering skill can also have a chance to damage the cells. I have a friend who have a spot welding machine and doing electric scooter tunings, packs and asked him to help me out with the welding. I believe there are economical/safety reasons why they are spot welding commercial battery packs."

"Crashing on an electric scooter. Lots of us little kids were riding down the coldesac (idk how to spell that) and this little motherfucker started doing a u turn in front of me, probably 50 feet away. So I swerved and went flying across the asphalt. It jammed my front teeth up my gums, absolutely wrecked my face, and I could hardly talk or spit the blood out."

I got some scrapes and I'm a little sore from the fall but otherwise I'm alright. My scooter  surprisingly took little damage but my backpack did get ripped up since I slid on my back after the fall. Also my airpods flew out of my ears and after I left the scene I went back to get them and one of them got ran over RIP.

"There are two buttons on the Apollo, plus two turn signal buttons.  Power on/off makes sense, but the other functions for turning lights on or changing modes are maddeningly obtuse.  Frankly I have no idea how its supposed to work and used the app to change my mode.  Handlebars are wider than they need to be.  Suspension feels plush, but I havent tested on rough roads or curb jumping to see how well it serves its purpose."
I am waiting on repairs through a no fault insurance claim for when two electric scooter riders crashed into me while riding from the footpath to the pedestrian walkway at Queen St/Collins St when I had the green light. Just last night I had two electric scooter riders riding toward me in the middle of the left lane on Flinders St. Without helmets. I could see a head on collision could have easily occurred.
Hypomania for me is getting a really stupid new hobby I would never do before like skateboarding and then hurting myself and being embarrassed and tossing the skateboard lol. Spending crazy money on gifts for people or really random crap. Everything is powered by this high energy and I barely eat. I get this feeling like bugs crawling under my skin in my arms and my brain will be buzzing with the same thoughts on loop or lots of music or ideas like my mind would be so busy and never quiet. I talk very fast too and sometimes get all my words mixed up because my brain is being faster than my mouth and I walk too fast for everyone. Then I crash hard into depression when it's over.

"Children experience a greater rate of fractures and polytrauma from e-scooters compared to adults, but fewer facial injuries despite a similar rate of head trauma. The incidence of pediatric head injuries indicates a lack of helmet use similar to adults. Lawmakers should consider bolstering e-scooter regulations to decrease pediatric injuries."
"If Marissa somehow crash lands? Rather than try to come to a safe halt she’ll embrace it, using explosions to align her vectors to shoot straight up (blasting a hole in the roof if need be). As she reaches the top of her trajectory, where the net forces acting on her are zero, she’ll form platforms of frags from various explosions to safely walk down."
"I've had one accident very nearly happen, where a small boy on qn electric scooter came from behind a spruce fence to the cross walk right in front of my car. Luckily I am not an 80-year old and I was driving under the speed limit and could stop the car in time. With your change to the law, if I had hit him, it would have been my fault."
"Stop Hitting Yourself! - Launching a storm of frags into Lomo’s arms, she’ll align their vectors just right, so that the force sends his arms smacking RIGHT into his face with lethal force. After a swift one two combo of his own making, Lomo’ll be down for the count!"
Almost every scooter crash has the potential to be face first. It's very different than a bike. I strongly recommend full face for any electric scooter.

"Electric scooters are everywhere in NZ. Mostly it's fine, businessmen getting from the train station to the office etc, but especially in the evening or at night it's teenagers riding around super fast. Saw a few scooter accidents while I was there. No one wears helmets with rented scooters and half the time they don't slow down to cross roads. So I saw 2 teens nearly hit by a car at a crossroads, an old lady knocked down and attended to by an ambulance (the person riding the scooter had fucked off by then), and 2 scooters crash into each other. I was almost knocked down on several occasions."
"Long story long, I'd say years of screwing up my body, and then one pretty bad car accident will definitely cause 2 bulging discs in ones spine. Back issues are no fun.

"The best part about the onewheel is how versatile it is. It can do so much more types of terrain that an electric skateboard cant. Not holding a remote and just moving with the balance of your body is also a plus (especially weaving around crowds on campus). Riding any electric board is always not the safest. If safety is your absolute priority, an escooter or ebike would be better. But the onewheel is 1000x more fun."

"Dogs in training. Any type of training but dogs who are fearful, reactive, or aggressive towards other dogs typically (and hopefully) have humans who walk them in on-leash designated areas with a level of traffic the dog can handle. Dogs with aggression issues may well be being walked in a muzzle making them incapable of defending themselves. They deserve to walk safely and in peace and not to have their training setback as do all dogs."
"Recommendations depend on your travel route, height, & weight."
Edit: you also should go back and support all those false claims you made in your previous comment.
The one we got was $200 refurbished from manufacture. Works great. Swagtron Swagger 5.

The user also has a rather questionable background with his stormcore causing trouble and with sparks flying from his motor.

"Google Translate has, or at least used to have, a function where you can speak into it and it will translate it into audio in your target language, and then the person you're talking to can do the same, so you can actually have a conversation of sorts. Saved my bacon in Beijing."

"Half of Belgium is debating the fate of a cat. It was a stray illegally imported from Peru, where rabies still exist. Peru doesn't want it back and there is no test, so the ""safe"" options are either quarantine the cat in a high bio-security environment; or kill the cat. (It was a big scandal initially since people were actively hiding the cat.)"
"Idk about you but I throw on elbow and knee pads from my skateboard days when I wanna do some fuckshit in the woods on my bike lol. Helmet too. Never gloves, that’s like sex with a condom; safer and less fun, plus less feeling. I’d probably crash more with gloves."

If you really want to help this person repair their scooter you’re going to have to pay for it privately.
Couple of accidents already
"So grateful for this test series, thank you Ireland. See you on the pitch."
The child was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. Police have area streets closed while the crash is being investigated.
Also using an electric skateboard of electric scooters if you cause an accident you are not insured. At all.
"Lift your light higher off the deck of the skateboard.  Mount it on a stiff coil spring so that in case of a crash, rider is not impaled, light remains reusable."
"You're also going to need consumables. There's the obvious powder, primers, projectiles, of course. There's also maybe some new brass from time to time, and other stuff like a bottle of lemi-shine, lube, and probably replacement decapping/depriming pins, and so on. I'm not going to go into casting your own bullets, but that is an option too."
"Past $2k budget, there are some electric mopeds like the CSC and NIU bikes you can look at that resemble 49cc bikes. There are also high end pedal ebikes that are basically motorcycles around that price range. Also motorcycles like Zero but those are pricey."

"Gino handed me a stack of paper work and walked me over to a yellow electric scooter, similar to the rentals that had been popping up all over the city over the past couple of months, but this one looked sleeker, faster. More dangerous for someone who didn't know how to ride a scooter, which I suspected was most of the people who rented the damn things."

"[1] for instance, electric micromobility vehicles (elio, electra meccanica, aptera, ampere, arcimoto etc) often don't have a steering column so there's nothing to collapse, it doesn't have a large front end so you can't design it as a crumple zone, and a regulated airbag for these smaller, sub-1000 pound 1 or 2 seaters, actually makes a collision more dangerous. It should have some safety regulation, of course, but the ones on a 3500 pound 4-seater toyota camry simply do not apply here. Same thing with ebikes (which have a assist limit of 28mph but you can easily buy a 1500W one that goes 40 and nobody will stop you, plus you can manually pedal on top to go even faster) - a 40+ mph bike does sound like some safety should exist that goes beyond the regulations surrounding bicycles but right now it's ""use a helmet and don't crash"""
"I wear Kevlar padded street motorcycle jacket and pants, a full-face motocross helmet, gloves, and hiking shoes when I plan on going fast (30+ mph).  It's all a matter of what you want to protect and what you want to leave exposed to possible serious injury.  Skateboard gear won't protect you at those speeds, and just imagine doing a fast faceplant on the road without a full-faced helmet."
"You don't need your guitar, or hardcover books, or your skateboard, or your 20"" gaming laptop, or your boom box or iron, all of which I've seen young people drag around with them.  Less is very very seriously more.  You want a book, you've got Kindle.  Maps? Reservation confirmations? Phone. You are not going into the Gobi Desert, so you can actually have the adventure of buying things you find you need, which is pretty fun actually (although finding deodorant in Hanoi was a challenge, since Asian people don't stink the way Europeans do)."

Strangest old man I've ever seen but I'm sure he's living his best life...
"The plan is put forward by TA - I don't know how much City support it has (despite what this article says), so I wouldn't get my hopes up, but if you read the plan you'll see that 25% can accomplish so, so much:"
"I love helmets and encourage them always, but when you won't really hurt anyone except yourself for not wearing them...a person can choose. Not wearing your seatbelt in a car?"
Some of you need to get out more.
"I used to skateboard and I used to race dirt bikes. Some of the best times in my life were spent doing those things. I'm 31 and I have quit both due to the injury risks involved. I'm super lucky that I was never seriously hurt with motorcycles, but I was constantly hurt skateboarding. No broken bones, somehow, but more rolled ankles and hematomas than any man should experience."
"Reminds me of the wooden PC that everybody said was going to burn the guys house down. Just yesterday someone posted a photo of a skateboard in their trunk and the whole comments section told them they're going to be impaled when they get into a crash. I had a ton of people tell me I'm an idiot for installing double cylinder deadbolts on all of my doors because ""I may be trapped in case of a fire"". Thankfully I'm not a dog and I can open a window to get out of the house."

This it the moment a killer bulldog called Beast lunged and barked at several people just days before it killed a 10-year-old schoolboy. Jack Lis has gone to pet the six-and-a-half-stone animal after school before it jumped up at him and launched a fatal attack.
So why didn't this keep on going? What was wrong with the idea?
"There's an industry term for this (I'm in the industry), legal arbitrage. Essentially it's using technology to escape a legal category so you can compete against established players without having to abide by the same rules. Think Airbnb and hotels, Uber and taxis, scooters and bike shares, facebook and news, ghost kitchens versus restaurants, cryptocurrency and regulated securities, or the market I'm specifically in, electric micromobility vehicles that you only need a regular license to drive but legally operate like a motorcycle so you don't need things like airbags or expensive safety systems."
"2 parts for the fender cover. Each piece would take between 14 - 24 hours to print. I would then attach them with screws, holes being thought of before printing. I printed using some sort of Polycarbonate filament to have an impact resistant material in case of a crash. (I have zero experience with 3D printing, so don’t judge me on that choice :D)"

"Not arguing that the car driver SHOULD have looked but most times they do not. When driving a scooter/motorcycle/bike in a busy city you need to drive like everyone is a moron and is out to kill you. Any experienced and trained motorcyclist or cyclist knows that getting doored can kill you and needs to ride like it. ""at fault"" won't bring the victim back from the dead or from serious life altering injury."
"That’s also sad, as a former FMX rider, skateboarder/skateboard dad and full life skier, I have to be active to stay happy, I’d honestly go insane if all I had to do was work, pay bills, repeat. Sure I could have an oilfield job instead of working as a Dj, a part time graphic designer, a live event promoter, and running a cell phone repair shop... not to mention a few other irons in the fire. But I’m home every night, and I get to not just watch my kids grow from afar I’m right there with them teaching, playing and simply enjoying this little time we get on this planet. What if that little crash was the end?? My last moments would have been spent having an amazing day with my son. So yes I probably could have a better paying occupation, but I wouldn’t be near as happy of a human. As I sit here still healing from my crash, I do know I should make a decent recovery, but my bills are surely backed up. I did apply for a service but I won’t know for a little bit if I qualify or not. It’s stressful as hell.. but then again we all get buried in dirt not dollar bills when we go."
"Well, only one of the articles mention cars being the issue (The Galindo article is actually referencing the Sepulveda accident...details on Galindo is here: Galindo he was riding at 4 am and not with permission. Article also points out he collided with a vehicle). The other three were people who crashed their scooters. Nobody wears helmets, and I'm betting that's a major contributor to deaths on scooters. Those things are inherently dangerous by their design. Decades of injuries from kick scooters validate that. Add an electric motor for speed, and you've just compounded the issue signficantly."
James: This is a new helmet. There's no foam in this one.
"Once on my old two-stroke gas conversion moped I was going straight and someone turned right directly into me, knocking me down and scraping up basically every exposed part of my body, but I was otherwise fine. Another time, yet again, someone turning right without looking I was kind of half way pinned between the car turning and a parked car on my little electric scooter, I broke off their side mirror with like... My body I guess avoiding being squished between vehicles."
"Interesting. I hope this doesn’t come off as a smart ass comment, but where is the line drawn between too risky and freedom to have fun? For example, how is it so different if you buy your child a skateboard and they smash they crash and die? I know that’s obviously legal, and of course it should be, kids should be allowed to have fun and get hurt and learn from it. But I do often wonder where the line is drawn that certain things are negligent."
What??
"""The gig is simple,"" Gino said, pointing at the scooter with his thumb. ""We pad you up. You hop on and we push go. The vehicle goes and we analyze the data of the crash. There's a recovery room near the office. Once you're feeling up to it, we go again. Any questions?"""
There was no surprise over the first player to have problems with the new tighter regime — Ousmane Dembele was fined an undisclosed amount for arriving three minutes late to the training ground on the Friday of Xavi’s first week.
"Both times I was fine but again, the fact that they didn't even immediately come to mind like just because we're pretty accustomed to the idea of getting mowed down by 3,000 pounds of metal and combustible fluid on a daily basis. Related: Cronenberg's ""Crash"" is an excellent film."
"I AM FEELING ALRIGHT AND HAVE CRASHED A LOT, BECAUSE I SIGNED UP FOR THAT POSSIBILITY AS A BIKE COMMUTER. BUT THIS WAS BAD LUCK, AND WE MADE GOOD OF A BAD SITUATION. I JUST HATE THESE STUPID ELECTRIC VEHICLES CAUSE MOST PEOPLE USE THEM STUPIDLY."
"My journey started with a razor electric kickscooter that I picked up from a neighbor.  My kids picked that up in a day, which then led to a purchase of 2 GoTRAX scooters.  Realizing my wife would probably want to join, that led to a purchase of a 600w suspension model."
"Keep in mind, the prices for tools and consumables fluctuate with the market. Sometimes wildly, like right now. There should be a drop in prices at some point, but we can never know just where it will end up at any given time."
"I'd go with an ebike any day of the week, especially where your sitting position is upright and relaxed."
I’ve been stood in a bus shelter watching for the bus and then stepping out onto the path as it arrives. Not heard the scooter coming and narrowly avoided a collision.
"You should- it has been successful for me.  My two favorites right now are AAPL and MSFT.   Most days I am very easily able to capture a .50-$1.00 move on these,  on a good day- several times.   Base hits, but steady."
"As far as with falls: look for pupils dilated different amounts, unusual drowsiness, lethargy, prolonged crying, disorientation, bleeding or fluid leaking"
"Question 4: What protective equipment do I need? I do some mountain biking so I have an old full face helmet for MTB and a newer half shell helmet (giro fixture mips) also for MTB, would these be sufficient for longboarding, or do I need a different kind of helmet to protect me from the different dangers of longboarding? If I should get a new one, what should I look at (I would be looking on a bit of a budget). Should I get gloves for sliding? Like I said I don't plan on learning slides yet but it seems to me having a material to slide on that isn't my skin and bones would be good in the event of a crash. I have kneepads but they are foam kneepads, designed for impact not sliding on asphalt (g-form pro x2 iirc)... Would these be worth wearing under my jeans or pointless?"
"The pros are that they are more portable and easier to store away, cheaper both buying outright and also cost to use vs gas cars, can be upgraded with an electric motor to go faster and still be cheaper than gas, better for the environment (just in air pollution, but also potholes since they are smaller and will not create potholes, or at least only super tiny micro potholes so roads will not need as much maintenance), easier to repair due to not needing jack stands and all that, cheaper to repair as well, allowed on other paths such as parks and hiking trails, can get through traffic a bit easier (Either going through vehicles like motorcycles, or you can dismount and get on the sidewalk, not riding most of the time, just walking it side by side), and the fact that they can be treated legally as both car and pedestrian. When on the road, they have the same rules and laws as cars (Although a few restrictions, such as they are not allowed on highways or freeways, so your talk of a true 50 MPH zone means they legally should not be there at all), but they can also easily turn into a pedestrian to cross a crosswalk to safely do a left turn."
"the sink. Honestly, I'd have been mortified, but OP wasn't, it seems. I also wouldn't stand on a sink to take my picture."
Laughing so hard you can’t talk.
"And talking about slowing down: I'm also impressed he actually breaks while still on the skateboard, instead of simply jumping off and let the skateboard crash into whatever was in front of him."

"Additionally, I attached a Voltmeter to visualize the battery charge percentage while riding. This also was very handy as the Onewheel App can not be used while riding: It seems that the App adds a software check that monitors the battery discharge rate, and after a few minutes, realizes that the battery doesn’t drain fast enough. This results in  another “incompatible hardware error”, which requires to restart the board. If the app isn’t opened, everything is fine as no error is detected (we can probably thank Future Motion for this “nice” software check)"
Let's try and keep our fun under the radar you're going to put our fun on the radar.
"The first thing that came to mind was donating blood. I had plenty of it, and whatever I lost, my body would replace almost instantly. But there was a limit to how many blood banks I could hit up before I was flagged. They were all connected and with policies designed to prevent desperate people from bleeding themselves hollow, literally, from over donation. It wasn't like I could tell them, No worries. I can't bleed to death, so take it all! So that income dried up sooner rather than later."
"The thing with videos like this, are how fucking stupid this girl’s friends are to just stand back and film, then laugh when they crash. No one held the scooter and helped her with throttle, no one gave her any pointers. Just stand back, film, and laugh."
Short Answer: There is no line.
"Street skating like today mostly wasn't a thing or a new thing in the very late 80s that didn't overtake vert at most, so often times for casual skaters it was just a transportation tool along with very minor to no street skate tricks and to some extent just a few things in the ramps, parks or bowls where most of the sport was practiced."
I commute everyday on a 150 scooter in traffic packed city and it’s just not fun no matter what you’re riding.
There are no cameras that could confirm the collision happened.
"Marissa’s initial goals are twofold! First, she’s gonna run around as much as possible to spread her footstep mines. As she builds up speed, she’ll eventually reach a point where she doesn’t even need to exert her muscles, letting blastforce steer her body. As she’s running, Black Moon partially summons its arms from her body, scraping them along walls, pews, or whatever the fuck it can grab ahold of, to plant charge above the ground. Moon blasts chunks of wall into its hands, which can create pressure charged grenades that it can lob wherever it wants throughout the map! Coverage is king. The sheer volume of footstep and other mines should compensate for her 3s time limit; Marissa should always have frags available to control."
"And what else can one expect? Julie’s half-hearted seduction of Olivier before skipping town is the most understandable one after the death of a spouse has ever felt like, because this so feels done out of desperation and instability rather than cunning design. Binoche plays it perfectly, you cannot possibly get mad at it; afterwards she self-harms by dragging her knuckles across a stone wall and both of these scenes are such heartbreaking grabs at trying to feel something, anything, whether it’s pleasure or pain. Neither seems to work. What eventually makes Julie snap out of it and rejoin the world, is realizing she’s clinging to a false memory, at least in terms of her husband. The movie doesn’t really have any solutions to what happens when a truly charmed existence as Julie seemed to have is suddenly ripped away, but when you lived a lie as Julie had with the presence of another woman in her husband’s life, letting go of the past is only sensical. In an odd way this awful truth seemed to set her free of her grief. The one mercy her husband afforded her, intentional or not."
Im not a doctor or therapist. I cant give you any guarantees. All i can say is what i felt worked for me. Anything that requires you to balance across a wide range of motion is good.
Unfortunately now if they lose their license they get a mobility scooter and crash into people with that. Theres been some really bad accidents with them where I live
"Edit: not even the guy I was thinking of, but here's another bloke from around the time I was there doing the same stretch OTS news article on ""hill bombing craze"" these guys need some electric wheels badly, but also these guys are now in their 50s 🤣"

I mean they could prob run a simulation with a crash dummy hooked up to a wire all the way down the rail with the skateboard strapped to the shoes.

"So I ask, when considering there are some serious pros and cons, why must you think bicyclists are BAD when they can turn into car or pedestrian when it's convenient? Besides just being upset that they have some pros to outweigh the cons and you are jealous, what actual LOGICAL reason is there to be upset about that?"
"As a player, Xavi always had strong opinions and personal standards but did not look for open confrontation with team-mates, preferring to lead by example. Some have now wondered whether he will have the character to take on former team-mates, and friends, should it be required to enforce the new code of conduct."
"JUST looking at the LA Times article, there doesn't seem to be enough evidence for further investigation."
I’d say OW is closer to a skateboard. You will fall it’s part of the game. Some wipeouts will be less severe than others. Most you will get up and keep going. Of course higher speed equals higher risk of injury. But in any board sport you should expect to fall every now and then at least. More if your pushing limits.
Get it or don’t but take responsibility for your own actions. If I fall and get hurt riding that’s on me. It’s a risk that I am conscientiously taking when I ride.
"A helmet should never be drilled into, cut into or modified in any way that alters the composition or structure of the materials.  In professional racing helmets must be less than 2 or 3 years old because both sun and sweat cause the effectiveness to deteriorate.  If a helmet gets road rash or you drop it and it chips the outer layer, it will no longer pass tech inspection. It should be pretty obvious that cutting holes in it goes against any manufacturers guidelines and warnings."
"I don't know, I'm averaging 40k miles a year the entirety of maintenance has consisted of tires and wiper blades, that's a better deal than an oil change every 5 weeks."
Sam Cane to usurp all his haters by imitating a heat seeking missile with zero fear and attempting to fold Irish forwards.
"I'd rather treat e-bikes as alternative to regular bikes for people who want a more comfortable ride, and they would be amazing if you're on The Netherlands, you could totally get away with not owning a car and using your ebike as your only mean of transportation, but if you live in a car dependent city, a 150cc scooter is imo a much more realistic car substitute."

"England, equally as bad, there’s one particular roundabout in Birmingham where I’ve seen at least 5 separate rear ending incidents. Plenty of maniacs all over the roads and cities like Manchester and Liverpool have some ludicrous road designs in parts."
"Either way, when you are in the park, if you are nervous about getting on a ride, just ask about options.  Some folks can just step in and out, but they have resources for people who don't.  Rides like Big Thunder, Slinky Dog, Rise and Ratitoullie have fold down transfer benches you can slide across into the ride. Some like Spaceship Earth and midway mania have vehicles with a wider door so they are easier to transfer into. Others still like Small World, jungle cruise, kilamamjaro safaris, and Grand Fiesta tour have vehicles you can drive a scooter onto (have never done it with a scooter, but my chair is custom fitted, so I can do the parks in it fine) and off of.  Some rides that are low down like frozen have steps they can put down for you to transfer up and outin steps instead of all at once.  Even at rides without these features, like Rockin' Roller-coaster, Cast members know how to use all these features, but often will not offer them unless you specifically ask for them so look for doors marked with a wheelchair, cutout lines on the side of vehicles, and transfer divices to the side of the exit zones and generally ask what options are available if you are nervous or unsure. The only rides you cannot transfer into without walking a significant distance are Peter Pan and the Peoplemover.  If you need you will need any assistance getting back out or will need your mobility aid brought closer to get off, ask a cast member when you are boarding and the help will be waiting on the other side.  Otherwise the only person there will be the person who has to work the controls."
"But then he decided to buy 2 more, both of the new ones being the Boosted Board V2's. His new personal board was one of the new V2's, while the OG v1 & other V2 were for the homies."
No morning traffic.
"Our study suggests that e-bike–related trauma may involve serious injuries and have typical injury patterns that resemble those seen in motorcycle-related injuries. Children are more likely to suffer head and face injuries because of their higher head to body ratio. We suggest that these injuries should therefore be triaged appropriately, preferably to a medical facility with proper trauma capabilities."
Driving fast with the windows down and the music loud.
"I see a lot of people say her (barely!) surviving cheapened the finale, but I don't see a lot of people consider the consequences of her injuries. She's young but that was absolutely brutal."
"Yes, in crowded city center I rarely go above 25km/h even when my scooter can go faster, but not everyone rides or lives in densely populated cities, so on long bike paths through the outskirts of the city or the surrounding countryside the 25km/h speed limit makes zero sense."
I think part of the problem is electric scooter and bike hire. When one group of road users show absolute disregard for road rules that will rub off on others.
"As for the car, they just drove off. The car behind them helped me up and made sure I was ok. I have their license plate but there isn't much I can pursue since my injuries were minor and my scooter was completely fine. Karma will catch up to them."
"the danger of those machines, is that supporting/adjacent muscles, stabilizer muscles may be imbalanced, or totally neglected. if a Mr Olympia tries to join a strongman competition, hes gonna have a real, real bad time, because ironically, his body isnt made for that. he may leave on a stretcher."
I get this.  I also get statements like “dont think about your MS and it wont bother you.”
"I’m an instructor... mostly for snowboarding, but I’ve taught skating and motorcycling also."
"This might go against the grain here, but you probably shouldn't rent a scooter. Yes, you don't need a license to get on one, I'm on Koh Phangan currently and have been riding around a good portion of the island. I handed in the key and said no more today after a near miss yesterday. Despite what anyone might tell you, they just aren't safe because if something does go wrong you'll regret ever hopping on."
Think about the cheapest experiment you can. Scrap it -- reduce costs by half in some brand new experiment. Then execute on that final fractional idea that still tests demand in the same market space.
"Riding an electric scooter in Austin,TX on Christmas Day 2021. Crash so bad I almost roll into traffic. Thought I broke ribs because I couldn’t cough, breath, or laugh for weeks after. All because I didn’t know how to use the brakes so thought I’d just jump off and run alongside while going too speed. Also I am 37 and don’t bounce up like I used to."
"Frustrated with the city’s handling of the problems at Rikers and other city jails, the U.S. Attorney’s office has threatened to seek an order putting the jails under court control."
Sidewalks are for pedestrians only. Bicycles and other vehicles are only allowed on the sidewalk if not ridden (ie you walk besides your bike)

"My mom felt much more comfortable once she realized the CMs were good just asking her mobility to direct her and she didn't need to worry about judgment for her silly injury (it was silly in her case, poor mom was so embarrassed). Since you have your own aids you use at home, maybe this isn't so much of a worry to you - but they know exactly how to accommodate guests and we never felt like we were inconveniencing anyone or anything. Hardest part was finding where her scooter would get moved to after rides sometimes lol"
"Nice, arguments like a kindergarden child."
"In saying this, you’d therefore expect that ppl wouldn’t crash in the emergency stop test - after all, it’s in a straight line - id say at least 40% of crashes on the course come from this one exercise or a relation thereof. Just because you can do it, doesn’t mean a single mum who’s 50 years old, who’s never been on a skateboard let alone a bike - can…"
"You’d need infrastructure for them separate from highways/sidewalks, SEVP small electric vehicle pathing that has grass on the sides so if someone does crash there’s a softer landing, ebikes, bicycles, scooters etc etc etc."
"I'm definitely not against helmets and gear. But, I've never needed it (in my entire life). I think that smart riding goes a long way."
"Using full gear is safer than not using it, but not riding is safer than riding. So whenever we jump on the bike we're already compromising safety in exchange of enjoyment."
"OP- if you’re going to do this to a helmet because you’re hot, just get a bicycle or skateboard helmet that has better ventilation and is only half shell. Or pony up the money and buy a good carbon fiber Mtn bike, they are lightweight and have good airflow.  You should not wear this with the expectation that it will protect your head in the event of a crash."

"I've used the theater options in my car a ton. We take bikes up to the mountains, rent an RV space and then at the end of the night a little Netflix or HBO is pretty neat using camp mode overnight. My kids use it the most though they're out in the garage with it almost every weekend. It was pretty awesome to have camp mode and AC in the garage overnight during a power outage and lose 9% of the battery."
"Incidentally, i dont feel like surfing was as good at rehabbing my ankle. I strongly feel like there’s something about what’s required of the board foot when pushing a skateboard that really maximizes the use of everything in there. Plus, its harder to switch stance in Surfing so neither ankle is being exposed to every scenario."
"A friend of mine ran into Sammy G last night and I guess he left on a scooter. Pretty cool that he seems healthy enough to at least be living life, even if he can't play. I feel like my world would be all sorts of fucked if I had that same injury."
"and adding traffic-calming infrastructure like bulbouts and curb extensions, so that every intersection is safe to cross and every street is passable for strollers and wheelchairs, and has space for benches, street vendors, bus shelters, bike parking, and public restrooms;"

Just legalise PEVs in a smart way. None of the max power nonsense (UpTo a limit. Like 5kw sustained) then just implement speed limits.
"Sadly I remember going to a show like this in 76’, I left with a $15 dollar skateboard determined to do one of those cool nose wheelie things!! Wooden board about 15” long on cheap assed wheels that a pebble the size of a bugger could stop. Many a crash on that thing!!"

BK is an artist whose work focuses a lot on feminism and western consumerist/capitalist culture. Her work often involves appropriating black and white photographs with block red and white text over them. She started this style in the 70/80s.
Student riding skateboard alleges he was riding across Channel Islands Road about 6:30 p.m. He saw a silver/tan vehicle and the car neither slowed nor stopped.
"Of course, the ideal strategy for dealing with this is obviously simply not getting hit and having to bleed in the first place."
"I like Arbor a lot, this board is quite playful for commuting. To pull off a trick or two while cruising around. It doesn't pump super great. Nice pool shape. Maybe you could read up on LDP (pushing and pumping style) and see if it's something for you. There are boards better suited for that. Those are also very very stable so also beginner friendly, even the most professional ones. For me it's a complete workout for my core, legs and stamina."
"They’re arguing that if he can’t stick it out through an innocent accident/mistake like that then he’s lacks the initiative, grit, and gumption to become a true legend."
I still have my teeth after drunkenly crashing an electric scooter.  My shoulder still hurts a bit though.

"Vietnam was a completely different world and felt much safer, simply due to the fact that it wasn't filled with drunken westerners doing stupid things."
"Also a good example of controlled fall vs uncontrolled fall. I used to skate, I know exactly how to fall off a skateboard to minimise injury. I had no idea what to do when I fell off a mountain bike."
James: It's to keep you cool on the road. It's custom made.
"Stop whenever you want: don’t feel like you need to keep driving, stop whenever you wanna take a break or look at something or stretch your legs. Again, it makes the drive feel more natural instead of something you have to do. Have some fun with it"
"Oh yeah, perspective totally changes depending on mode of transport. I drive around too, and then pedestrians and riders drive me crazy, and of course the electric skateboard dudes. But hey, we all need to get around, and stuff happens. No matter how I travel the streets I just pretend I am invisible to everyone else and proceed accordingly. We have all kinds in the city, and everyone needs to get where they are going. Ive brushed off a slight tap or scuff with another car, a few times. Once had a minor accident with a cop that blew a light wo lights or siren, we simply agreed it was minor and went on our separate ways. One of the reasons I run a beater Prius around town, the little cosmetic things don’t really matter, and who wants to steal it? Nobody."
This days if I have absolutely nothing to do and I'm tired of books and TV shows I would just play games on ps5 or clean the house or find something else to do just making sure I'm busy.
"You know what you should do, get both off Amazon and return the one you don't like. But whatever you do, please make sure you have a proper bike light installed. Most scooter lights are worthless, and you're bound to crash due to the potholes here at Berkeley."
gave myself a smiley of all smilies during self harm. Heated the lighter up for couple minutes and held it down as hard as I could on my arm until it stopped hurting. It melted the skin. Got mega infected and now a big pink ‘a’ on my forearm for everyone to ask about it. I’m not depressed now to do shit like that again.
Youre clearly too young to understand that but one day you will.

"He was also blaming crapto for stocks tanking. As if people are selling long TSLA shares because their shitcoin leverage got margin called. I'm pretty sure it's exactly the other way around. People are selling their ""buy and forget"" crapto to cover their options margin calls."
"Also, my boss has to cover 50% of the electricity used in my commute lmao"
"Oh and for extra information, especially with the electric kick scooters, recommend that they get a full face helmet with MIPS, since most crashes in kick scooters results in the face being hit, and MIPS is a layer that detaches inside so the helmet spins without snapping your neck."

ADHD is like riding a skateboard down a hill with the worst speed wobbles known to man. Sometimes you can miraculously pull through and make it down to the end of the hill but most times speed wobbles get the best of you and crash.

"I wanted to upgrade from the L9 to the City Pro to get a more complete polished package, controllable regen braking, less maintenance, more hill-climb power to get around Pacific Heights, Telegraph Hill and similar areas.

"After some distance, he saw a lady again, asking for a lift. But this time, he pretended to not see her and kept driving. He kinda increased his speed a bit to hurry home sooner. After some distance, something caught his Peripheral vision. He turned his head on his side, to see the same woman running parallel beside him. She was looking straight in his eyes with a huge grin on her face. He was so shell shocked, he twisted his wrist, and went full acceleration at around 100 kmph. After some moments he went unconscious."
First timer long road trip recommendations:
"As the match begins, Ravee and Winona set their sights to the south, towards the pit stop. Hopping onto Persephone, Winona and Ravee will race towards the pit stop to get materials, Winona slashing at any obstacles in the way to turn them into easily run-over gel. While Winona drives, Ravee will begin to lightly absorb energy from the bike at her usual dancing rate, and whenever her stand hits the C Power limit she’ll move her feet apart from the bike before reconnecting them in order to gain more energy."
I owned both an electric skateboard and onewheel. I sold the electric skateboard and kept the onewheel. Now with 3000+ miles and no major injuries. My boardsport experience was very limited before the onewheel.
"And wheelchairs. I speak as someone in a wheelchair once years ago due to an injury. The person pushing me kept bumping me into pedestrians. I was absolutely mortified, and kept apologizing. I told her to stop, but she would eventually do it again. She was just an impatient person. After that I got a scooter, lol. She could speed off all she wanted and I just moseyed along."

-  Use lights at night.  Way too many idiots out there riding in the dark without lights.  Lights help you to be seen.
"That said, in some cases you could get away with an ebike, but I'd argue depending on your situation they may not be capable enough. Being able to substitute cars will depend a lot on your infrastructure, they'll be fine if you have robust bike lanes, but if you're forced to keep up with traffic it won't cut it, and imo even a 50cc scooter would still be a little underpowered, I'd rather get a 125-150cc one so speed is not an issue. Plus they're much quieter than those 50cc 2 stroke scooters."
"I'm in Bristol and they have royally gone to the ends of the earth to mess it up so bad!! I used to like driving but now it just feels like a headache. I've never suffered from anxiety but being on the roads here now gives me massive anxiety. Every time I'm driving or in a car I have to dodge people in other cars just pulling out on you or drifting into your lane or slamming on their brakes half way round a roundabout. Every single time I always nearly have a crash through no fault of my own. You ever been on the dodgems or bumper cars? It's exactly like that!! Anyways I know I'll get shit for this but I've got an electric scooter, yea I'm 35 😂😂, but my scooter does 40mph with full suspension and hydraulic disc brakes and lights and I'll tell you, it's a dream to drive, it's like the stress of driving is gone and I feel free!! I've gone past worrying about the feds, I don't just don't care, I won't stop for them and they definitely won't catch me on it once I do a 180° turn and zoom off 😂. But yea I can get anywhere in Bristol twice as fast and less stress than a car. When you factor in the cost of a car purchase, tax, insurance, mot, fuel etc, the cost is a tiny fraction of what a car would take. Bristol has got to be 1 of the worst congested places in the country though for sure."
"Find something like a quiet parking lot to just start getting used to the board and turning, ensure you have crash pants and elbow pads. Other people will tell you to use a helmet and wrist guards, but I never felt I needed those for learning how to do basic flat tarmac moving around. You will mostly hurt your hip or butt and leading elbow while you get used to the board."
"His Uncle was driving a Scooter (like a moped) at night, going back home from work. He saw a Lady, who gestured for a lift. He stopped besides her and asked her. She told him that she needed lift till her neighbourhood. He agreed since he just wanted to help a lady out in need. After some distance, she asked him to drop her. He wished her goodnight, and went on his way. After some distance, he spotted another Lady asking for a lift. That lady was also wearing a Sari (Traditional Drape), but he couldn't recognise her face. She told him the same thing, and he helped ""another"" person. Again, he wished her goodnight, and went on his way. While driving away, he had a cold shiver running down his spine. The realisation was starting to dawn over him, but hadn't quite yet."

What worked for me is becoming more independent with my mobility after I was able to buy whill ci electric scooter and creating new activities and hobbies for my self so I'm busy throughout the day. I also got a puppy so I rarely feel lonely this days.
"That said, my situation is somewhat unique.  If you do not have tools already and can't do the maintenance yourself, it is probably more expensive than a typical car.  I can, so it saves me money, and my other option for transportation is a rather large and thirsty pickup truck.  I have friends in the trades who don't move tools and materials who have stopped driving cars and moved to everything from vespa type scooters (gas and electric, depending on need) as well as the really tiny battery powered stand up scooters similar to what are available to rent by the hour in many US cities."
"Already commented a bit, came back with a relevant video. But first to answer this question, IMO yes one week could work, but you'll want to give yourself some time to learn / train every day for that week.

"And if you can find a place to rent a knee scooter (and you are going places where you aren't needing to ""off road"" that'll be much better and enjoyable."

"All in all it took me about 2 weeks to print the different parts, assemble the battery pack (lots of sparks here), link the BMS to the pack and put everything together. I added a switch button to turn on / off the external battery connection. This became handy for several reasons:"
"Funny story I hit a piece of unmaintained sidewalk on an electric scooter and broke my collar bone when I hit the ground. Tried to sue the city for poor maintenance (I just wanted my medical bills paid and my missed work covered, $20k) and none of the lawyers in my town would take the case because they didn’t want to be known as the lawyer that sued the city and won. They all said that. Supposedly it would be bad for their reputation."

"Things also drastically changed for me when I got a whill ci electric scooter since I was having a hard time leaving the house on my manual wheelchair having a high injury level I wasn't very mobile. Now I live by myself, walk my dog, do grocery shopping go to downtown for comedy shows, all by myself. This is a huge ego boost I even have audacity to flirt with women when I go out on my scooter😂"
"Leaving Oregon I would stay northern and head through Iowa and wyoming. It will be absolutely beautiful and less crowded. In the Midwest, I would really recommend taking the scenic route (linked below) through nebraksa and staying northern, for the same reasons but especially for avoiding the crowds of truckers on 80."
"Of course none of this is impossible, there are plenty of people who have mobility impairments and care for children or dogs perfectly well. It would be wrong to assume this lady can’t nanny or dogsit if she has a mobility impairment - and perhaps she gets around well and her mobility isn’t significantly impaired."
"I can see why someone would think that having an exercise regimen will put you at risk for injury, thus defeating the point of getting healthy. Before I got serious into exercise, I had this mentality. I had two coworkers who seemed to be constantly in physical therapy related to injuries incurred through their exercise activities. One was training for the Iron Man. Every time she talked about the stress that training was doing to her body, there was a smug voice in my head that said, ""I may be a couch potato, but at least I don't have a new injury every month!"" Every week this woman was either going to the doctor or to PT."
"Question 2: is my board capable of any downhill riding? Is it too short, or are the trucks somehow wrong for it?"
"Is your foot in a cast? Or a walking boot? (Cast for long flights probably shouldn't do this, your foot could swell and cause pain, other issues.)"
"She frowned and looked down at the yellow envelope she was holding. “Well I could lose my job, but if what you’re saying is true and these lottery numbers pull through, I ain’t gonna need it anyway. So stuff it,” she said, handing over the document."

Fair point about the dedicated brakes.

You should contact your insurance company and see if they can help you. At the very least I imagine they’ll point you in the right direction. You can also go to the police department (not 911 - that’s for emergencies) and file a complaint against the driver. There’s a police station on MLK downtown near the ymca.
Those that support the anti-car movement should be happy with switching from an internal combustion engine to an all-electric vehicle...
"It was basically glossed over, literally just naming franchises they will technically own. I'd love another new game as much as the next person but boy my hopes are low"
"Funnily enough, when I visited DC like 3 years ago, there were electric scooters for rent everywhere and my classmates were using them but I was genuinely afraid that I would get into an accident, since I was really out of it the whole trip, was wearing literally the worst shoes (I was separated from the group at one point because I couldn't walk down the stairs of the Lincoln Memorial fast enough) and obviously didn't have a helmet. At one point I did try to rent a scooter but experienced technical difficulties because even my phone was like ""naaaaaah""."
"Yes, the centre of gravity might be lower but overall I find the position on the vehicle much less secure. You're standing on a very narrow platform, the handlebars don't take any of your weight and the wheels are rather small... I felt that if there was like a pine cone or a small rock that got in front of the wheel, I would go flying over the handlebars and break my neck. My position in those kinds of situations is a lot more secure on my bike. And vulnerability in crashes involving cars is probably about the same. So I will definitely stick to bikes."
"Let's be clear: I don't have a better suggestion. Your plan seems to be to let'er rip on the footpaths, consequences be damned - the harm^1 is not^2 hypothetical^3. But it also doesn't seem impossible to address, so I'll give you that."

"We are mid service and this guy is completely lost. It's so busy, lessons are over now. I think we've all been in a spot like this where it's just easier to go into overdrive and power thru rather than show this guy how to do everything."

"I held up my resume and nodded. ""I'm Ricky. I'm here for the Craig's List job."""
"It's interesting to read someone give an almost entirely honest explanation of ""the anti-car movement"" sprinkling in a few misrepresentations (eg: ""Anti-car supporters also argue that making more space for cars creates induced demand..."" included demand is a thing and we've known about it long before cars became commonplace). And then go completely off the rails at the least possible second for no reason in particular."
"Side note: I was once called by a receptionist and shamed for seeing a walk in doctor that wasn’t affiliated with the office that I’m a patient of, lol. He ordered me my last MRI for my previous sports injury. It scared me into never getting a second (or first, in person) opinion ever again because I don’t want to be de-rostered."

"That car isn’t being used by you after that. If you call me drunk at the party I’m picking you up, I’m not having you drive drunk. I’ll beat your ass another day, I can’t do that if you die in a car crash or kill Someone else. Moms gonna know the next day when you’re throwing up from your hangover.

"It takes surprisingly little impact to cause a traumatic brain injury. I see no reason besides ignorance, hubris, or vanity to not wear a helmet every time you are on a bicycle (or a skateboard or scooter, for that matter). It can and will save your brain if your head hits something hard. Just falling over on your bike--not moving, not colliding with another bike--is enough impact to injure your brain depending on what object or surface you land on. And none of us are such perfect riders that we can perfectly control our bike in all conditions AND control everyone around us. Just wear the helmet. It only takes once for it to be worth it."
The student could not confidently which of the two vehicles struck him.
"As shown on the first pictures, I went for the controller board connection since my battery pack would have its own BMS and I wasn’t sure of the implications of having my battery behind the Onewheel BMS with (maybe?) different chemistries, and drastically different capacities. Thanks to online tutorials, this step was fairly easy."
"I gotta say though, to your point - I have been considering getting a motorcycle. That joy that you can get from the sense of motion is something else. I really do feel it missing from my life, even though I know motorcycles are incredibly dangerous. I'm trying to think of something less dangerous that is just as convenient to do regularly and provides the same feeling, but haven't figured it out yet."

"considering motorized anything arent allowed on the sidewalks what the motorcyclist did was very illegal they arent allowed to pass you and they arent allowed to use the bike path, they are road vehicles which means a scooter/moped and motorcycles are road use only as they hit over the speed limits and just like a truck and car they have to be obeying the behind the car rule, a electric bycicle(the ones that look like normal bikes)/escooter(the ones that look like normal scooters) is slower there for are allowed on the bike paths and side of the road only granted anything that goes 30khm and over is road use only and arent allowed on the sidewalks and bike paths."
"The quintessence of knowing the difference between a calculated risk and wanton recklessness. And one reason you haven't already sold your worldly possessions and are in Vegas right now, taking a little break as you type your posts."
These scooters have no design regulations yet as the law hasn’t caught up with them. So if you’re going to ride one on the road it’s at your own risk.

"The job was in the warehouse district in north Brooklyn. The warehouse itself was tucked away in the back of a complex where other warehouses were either storing lumber or manufacturing sparks. The air smelled of oil and soot and of tamales from the vendor carts packed around the gate entrance. I damn near snarled at one of the carts as I walked in, but I'd already had a bite that morning. Enough to keep the hunger at bay."
"Honestly, it's just funny that every skateboard post that's ever been on reddit gets a bunch of people who seem to think they need to tell everyone to wear a helmet. 99.9% of people at this level don't wear helmets. I know a lot of people here think it's just because they want to look cool but I assure you, it's not. Are you hearing about professional skateboarders sustaining crazy head injuries all the time? If you're knee jerk reaction to that question is, ""well it does happen, and they should just wear helmets in case"" then it's probably more about thinking you know what's best for others rather than caring for their well being. There are plenty of scenarios in life and especially sports where a helmet would be beneficial in an accident but aren't commonly used for various reasons. Major league pitchers don't wear helmets and they get line drives to the head occasionally. I'm sure plenty of soccer goalies get concussed taking shots off the dome. No one's up in arms about them wearing protection"

"We could deep dive into specific statics on how probably 50+% of skateboards bought barely see any use. Millions of kids buy a skateboard each year and never take it beyond the driveway, but statistics don't show that. Only boards bought vs deaths. But that's a much longer study that would take quite a lot of time to compile. Cars on the other hand see extreme use on almost every purchase, logging tens of thousands of miles and vehicle hours."
"I try to avoid driving in town generally nowadays, but I do admit I find it tame compared to the other places in terms of personal experience, did get caught behind a lad at the top of Patrick’s hill last week though who had a change of heart right at the top and decided to try and do a u-turn there and some other lad came through the Little Island roundabout on an electric scooter last week without yielding and almost got decapitated by the car beside me."
Anthrax really liked PE. So much so that they collaborated on Bring the Noise.

"Yep. Cos no one has been killed or at least seriously injured by a bicycle, skateboard, electric bike or monkey bike have they? Kids, elderly, disabled (like blind or deaf people) use footpaths too. They should have the right to be free from the risk of injury or worse while walking on the footpath. I don't give two shits if you agree with me or not. I don't think any of these should be on footpaths. But you do you. Let me know how you feel when someone gets injured."
"All of this basically means, in many areas, motorcycles aren't a complete solution for most people, because part of the year, they'll feel that they need something else. (And, when we're talking about higher-speed private transportation, that means that many will get a car if they can, and you're back to square 1 - or worse, because now they need to store a car and a motorcycle.) It may be worth noting that the areas that are motorcycle-dominant tend to have warmer climates (avoiding winter concerns altogether), and many of them are less wealthy than, say, North America or Western Europe, too (so a car simply isn't an option for them), which affects all of this..."
"On the subway ride home, despite how pissed I was, I realized this was a actually absolutely fucking genius.

(And my beanie that says “want it, buy it, forget it” sits in the back of my closet.)"

"I totally agree with some of your points. Specifically, there should be a law requiring everyone to wear a helmet when riding a bicycle or electric scooter. Many places with directly funded healthcare have these laws on the books already. Skiing isn’t really on public roads so it’s kind of a different situation."
"I used to ride an electric skateboard for transportation (sometimes in combination with a bus, even then the bus driver might not want me on with the skateboard, claiming it might explode, I laughed and told him 'not with how much I paid for it') and even though I was to the side where bicyclists and such should have a safe space, they never gave me that proper space, speeding by way too close. Some would yell as they passed by to 'get off the road!' (distracting my navigation in the process). Have had a few try to cause me to have an accident to prove their point, one time I was forced to ride into grass patch and fell safely enough to avoid being hit, the driver actually tried to run me over and sped away after."
You absolutely should not have the dog pulling you or running on hard surfaces before they are 1.5 - 2 years old. That will f up their joints early in life.

"Luckily for you, the trains haven't been too crowded since the pandemic started.  Nowadays, they are a bit more crowded then they were during Spring 2021 (the time I first started taking the subway again after over a year), but nowhere near pre-pandemic levels.  So generally speaking, yes, you can take a scooter or bike on to the subway."

"No. Trump was responsible for the holocaust, the Armenian genocide, WW2, the Korean war, the Vietnam War, 9/11, the Arab Spring, the Crusades, the Islamic invasion of Spain, the formation of Israel, he was also responsible for driving the Jews out of Israel in the first place,in fact the Egyptians did nothing wrong; it was Trump who was responsible for enslaving the Jews. Trump is secretly a scaly and one day while he was wearing his snake suit he tricked Eve and told her to eat the apple. He also killed Abel. He also lead the Mongol invasions of everywhere. And the Hun invasions. And the Mughal invasions of India. And the Viking invasions.Trump was the guy who started colonialism(only the invading part not the part where they provided technology and medicine to the natives). After Trump tested positive for Covid19, he spit on Native Americans, nearly driving them extinct. Trump also killed all the dinosaurs. He was also behind the Bronze age collapse. Trump single-handedly did the Triangular Slave Trade; hell he was the guy Trump bought the slaves from. Trump also beheaded a French teacher for disrespecting Mohammad, and blamed it on wholesome Muslimerinos. All the blood diamonds are produced by Trump. He was the guy who cut Congolese workers hands off because they did not meet his supply. Trump chased Kyyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha with a skateboard and beat him up and snatched his rifle, and used it to kill Jacob Blake. During the BLM protests Trump was the one who looted and burned all the stores. Even during the Charolletsville incident, they were all shadow-clones of Trump. Trump did Pearl Harbor and bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Trump was the mastermind of the Holodomor, the Great Leap Forward, East Germany and every time a tankie screams ""It was not real communism"", Trump was involved. Trump grilled the last dodo. Trump shoots Palestinian kids for fun and shoots missiles at Israeli civilians. He was the guy who killed all those Rohingyas, and Uyghurs. He was also involved the current Hong Kong situation; so much involved that he was the one who sold opium to the Chinese. The Irish potato famine, Africa, the Bengal Famine; all because of Trump. Trump commits human rights violations on North Korean citizens everyday. Al Qaeda, Mujaheddin, Boko-Haram, Taliban; TRUMP. He also killed the prophet of the wholesome 100 Muslimerinos, Sulemani; in a missile strike. He also did the Rape of Nanjing and it was Trump who ordered and supplied all the Korean comfort women. Trump personally snitched on Anne Frank to Trump. The Jim Crow laws were passed by Trump, as well as the war on drugs. The partition of India was Trump's fault, as well as the resulting Kashmir issue. He also starred in the Cuban missile crisis and started the cold war. During the Russian Revolution, the peasants understood that Nikolai II's family was innocent, and would offer them a chance to leave, but Trump massacred them. Trump tried his best but failed in preventing the American and French Revolutions, but he got back at them by causing the Reign of Terror. Trump tortured Louis XVI's son and forced him into saying that he had sex with his mother and aunt, and promptly guillotined them. Trump invented pineapple-pizza and Tofu-Chicken. He was the guy who snitched on Alan Turing, revealing that he was gay. The judge felt that such a respected professor could be sent away with a slap on the wrist, but Trump rigged the jury and sentenced him to hormonal therapy. Trump rigged the New York Stock Exchange and caused the great depression. In the town of Waco, he raped a woman, blamed it on a black man and lynched him by burning him alive. He was the leader of the Khmer Rouge and wrote the plot for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Despite making up only 3.0211238398812703164724804575659e-7 % of the population Donald Trump commits 100% of the crimes. Trump also was the dictator of Uganda. Trump regularly kills journalists and opposition leaders in Russia. He was behind Princess Diana's car crash. Trump fucked a monkey and started the AIDS pandemic. He started coronavirus and ebola and the Black Death and the Spanish flu and the Bubonic plague and the syphillis outbreak and the Trojan war and tthe Bush war and the fall of Rome and the Dark Ages. After taking a dump, Trump leaves his toilet paper like this. Trump burned down the Notre Dame, and knelled on George Floyds neck. He also was the guy who sold drugs to George Floyd. Trump is the reason I am the only person in my class who doesn't have a girlfriend. Trump is the reason why the Armenia Azerbaijan crisis is even there."
"Edit: Wait wait wait! You need a scooter. If you crash it, no worries you don’t have to pay. I know where I’d crash it."
"And a normal person, on hearing that, will give that dog ample space so as not to stress it out and put their own dog in danger. You, however, let Mack run full-speed up to a dog who doesn’t like dogs — a fact that you knew — and get in that dog’s personal space. You put Mack, that dog, and that dog’s handler at risk of injury. You are without a doubt, 100%, the asshole here. If that wasn’t bad enough, you, a 25 year old grown man, were about to CHASE DOWN AND YELL AT a 16 year old girl for the crime of walking her dog. There are so many things wrong with that course of action, I don’t even know where to begin."
"I'm not quite elderly yet and I had an electric scooter like you're describing. Even for shorter distances the standing position on it left my legs feeling pretty gummy afterward. Additionally I had a near-catastrophic crash when I went over a small dip in a residential street because its small wheels were evidently no match for the terrain. To me the weight distribution also just feels less safe, standing upright."

"Back before the Tinder days I met a random girl from the internet at her apartment for the olden days version of a Netflix and chill.  She was telling me how she worked at the Hard Rock as a housekeeper and that one of the perks of the job was that pretty reliably she would find leftover bags of cocaine and other drugs in the rooms after guests checked out.  That story along with a few others made me feel pretty sketchy but I had poor impulse control so we had sex anyway.  It wasn't really going very well initially, but at some point it started to get really good.  After we finished I realize that the part where things got good were because the condom had broken and I started having a mild panic attack about the possibility of getting this chick pregnant because as bad as all my stories were she was worse.  She doesn't seem concerned and just takes a shower and goes to bed but I can't rest at all, as soon as the sun comes up I take off to the pharmacy and show back up at her door about an hour later with some plan B pills and relay the pharmacist instructions to her."
"I feel this so much, my sincerest sympathies my friend."
"It's a 180. Half a circle, right?"
Obviously the choice is yours  I’m just trying to impart a bit of wisdom gathered over years and many thousands of miles of riding these electric scooters many people also find that they enjoy riding scooters and having one that you can go out for a long relaxing cruise on is a bonus of getting one with a longer range  .
You mention a fight.  Getting in a fight while wearing skates results in your injury.  (Back to item #1.)
"Just be aware there's some weirdos here who don't have spinal cord injuries but have a fetish for disabled women, they're called ""devotees🤮"" if you get DMs asking for transfer videos and such just block this sick mfs. I have quite a few female friends from this sub who told me some stories haha"
"They were caught with a level of drunkenness/drug intoxication that would mean losing their car driving license / having a hard time getting one if they didn't have one yet, going to trial for a criminal offense, and having to take a hard psychological evaluation if they ever wanted their license (back)."
Hey Jerry I’m real sorry to hear about what happened to you. I had a scooter when I was younger and got into all sorts of trouble. The thing with traffic collisions is that they can cause damage that’s not immediately apparent and it’s important to get checked out. It will also help you with seeking damages from the driver that hit you since you’ll be able to trace your injury to the accident.
"You don't have to walk everywhere! I have a mobility scooter that allows me to travel up to 15 miles, and it goes slows enough that I can avoid injury"

So I took a 5 minute cold shower.
"The current hot trend is a pop-up market experiment cheaper than even a food truck. Market confirmation in hand, you then use the food truck to scout prime locations. Only with these two preliminaries in place would you then start a sit-down location. Even when your 'newbie sense' tells you the sit-down is a sure thing."
so the only improvement would be getting the skateboard/flat floorpan?
Literally anything that could eat away at electricity would be worth doing. Crypto Mining (despite the recent crash) is the first thing I can think of that you could start making a profit on relatively quickly.
The main reason people are changing their rail shape is to gain something out of their board that straight rails cannot. Lets take a look at wtf rails for example. The patent explains this pretty well
"Another victim of car culture. As usual, plenty of people in the comments suggesting cyclist should have made eye contact, waited for truck driver, crossed several lanes of traffic and used the other side of the road, worn different clothes, been more careful... or simply not existed.  Fucking peasant non-motorised humans... the audacity of existing in the places they live. Scum. Yes eye contact would help in this absurdly dangerous situation, but I wish r/IdiotsInCars commenters would take a step back and focus more on what lead up to the situation being dangerous, and not the actions of the victim in the seconds prior."

Because FLORIDA. There's a reason it's allowed here. Most drivers are aggressive speed demons and hateful towards anything not a car. Every road is treated like a highway.
Is the reason you don't ride an unpowered scooter or a bike that you need the battery power to get around?  What about e-bikes which are completely legal (unless they're 
“Pangea”
that truck is definitely moving more than 70kph.
Can’t get better without getting on the skateboard and attempting tricks. Might crash here and there but it’s a necessary step in the path to becoming a legend of the art form. An absolute visionary
"“They are right on top of everyone, those who are playing, and those who are not,” says a source who knows Xavi. “Changes were needed and there will be changes made. He has insisted a lot on that message (from his press conference), that when rules are followed things go well, when they are not followed control and commitment are lost.”"
"This isn't always going to be true. Some pavements are designated as shared bike/ped paths, which means bikes and (trial) scooters are allowed to travel on these paths. And the new highway code reinforces the legal position of bikes/Peds(/scooters?) having right of way if you're turning into/out of a road (or car park presumably)."
"Based on what my American friends have told me, there is a significant difference, but since I haven't lived in the US since having children I don't have any first-hand experience, unfortunately."
"The defender had previously explained how he can combine his other activities with being a professional footballer, including admitting he flew to the USA in 2019 for a business trip without coach Ernesto Valverde’s permission. But now a source who knows him said he had decided himself to “cancel some commitments and to prioritise things”. The same source pointed out that other players had also cancelled or postponed sponsors’ events these last weeks, although without the same spotlight that Pique always attracts."
"ESK8 spills are easier to run out since you're usually thrown forward instead of domino style, but they also have the potential to happen at higher speeds. Unless you have pneumatic tires and/or a decent longboard deck, yeah you're going to eat it if you hit a bump wrong. Onewheels also have issues with bumps but not always to the same extent. It really depends on rider skill, I've eaten it after wobbling from bumps but my friends can usually handle it.Conclusion: A little safer at the same speeds but can get pretty nasty the faster you go. Maybe a little less common that Onewheel spills."
"And let me tell you something. I didn't tell you all of this here as a random cry for sympathy or prove you wrong or some shit- because i literally don't have to prove anything to you.I've written this to you, in the hopes of you understanding that not everyone is in the same situation as you. I am extremely happy, that you love your parents and seem to have a good relationship with them, based on your comment here.But that gives you absolutely no reason to tell someone else that their pain is irrelevant. Stop telling people that their struggles aren't valid. That is not for you to decide."
Wholeheartedly agree but I crash too often on my skateboard. Haha

Here's a picture of Eazy E from NWA with a Natas deck. He was a skater too.
"“Hey!” The driver shouted but before I heard anymore I jumped from the cab, rolling onto some grass on the side of the road. A moment later tires screeched and the cab ploughed into a traffic light, glass smashing everywhere."
"The first is in the infrastructure. German cities are much more walkable, and so small children can already navigate them by themselves, and don't need their parents to chauffeur them around everywhere. Obviously this depends on where you live - but, to take one example, my daughter started walking to and from school with friends (no parents, except in the first few weeks) from age 6, at age 8 she could walk to and from school by herself (and therefore choose when to come home from school once her lessons for the day had ended), and by age 9 she was taking buses and trains by herself (within the local area). At age 10 they also do a ""cycling test"" (akin to a driver's license test, but for bicycles), and once they pass it, they're allowed to cycle to school. Before that they will have cycled extensively all over the town with their parents, but at that point they can be trusted to cycle by themselves. All her friends live within a kilometer or two, and if she wants to go and see them, she grabs ker kick scooter and goes, as she's been doing since the start of elementary school. Some of her activities are close enough that she can go there by herself, while others are further away and still need chauffeuring."
"My goals are getting better at riding the pool (drop-ins, also with surfskate), maybe some small Ollies to get up and off sidewalks, infinite loops and better slides especially going off an incline."

"In both cases, the police could still charge them for the criminal offence. But it still wouldn't prevent you being considered liable for the crash on the civil side."

"Scooters are portable, you can fold them up and bring them on the bus. It's raining outside and you don't want to ride home? Just chuck it in your friend's trunk and get a ride. Etc etc. There's just endless convenience with the reduced size. You can chuck it into an uber, bring it onto Bart, into a restaurant, a shop and stow it somewhere very easily."
"If the at fault driver had been, for example, drunk, their insurer would pay the other side then pursue the driver for costs."

"I think first 2 years the trick is to stay busy at all time, I was reading neurology books and watching countless lections on royal institutions youtube channel, doing everything you can not to make sure your mind is busy with other stuff rather then just going in circles thinking how could this happen, why did this happen, why me."
Abortions are allowed and there’s no judicial bounty system.
Not sure why she would have a hospital bill though. At the time of the accident she was admitted to a public hospital (Alfred) via ED which is free (unless you decide to be admitted as a private patient which makes hospital care which would have been free subject to the excess charged under your private health insurance). Perhaps she chose to have follow up shoulder surgery in a private hospital rather than public - understandable as it may have been quicker to access.
There actually was a lot of satanic themes in the skate punk scene but it wasn't really serious. It was more like a fuck you to the Christian authority.

"I have been a bicyclist for 30+ years and scooter rider for 4+ years. I've ridden on city streets, amongst traffic, in all weather conditions. I don't wear any protective gear or a helmet. Nearly 10,000 miles on electric scooters, and countless (definitely in excess of 100,000 miles) on my bicycle. No serious accidents of any kind. In fact, only one slip and fall on the scooter (learned not to have solid tires) and one very minor accident on my bike. Two minor incidents in 30+ years."
We rented a scooter in advance for my mom and ended up having to get a second for my significant other when an old foot injury of his flared up. They were great!
"I also know a guy that used to ride one of those electric skateboards that you power via a handheld remote. I think it went up to like 30-40km/h at top speed. When he first showed it to me I asked him if he'd ever heard of the law of conservation of momentum. He told me it's no big deal and the thing had brakes. I asked him about it recently, apparently he doesn't ride that skateboard anymore. I wonder what might have happened..."
"You keep bringing-up cars like e-scooters could be a replacement for them. It's not a fair comparison, even if we both agree that cars are also a problem."
"love Tool & Deftones too, but already so pissed i feel like all 3 would just drive me to start burning down the restaurants im waiting at right now lol but ya, maybe tomorrow post-crash"
Nice people in line at the DMV
Sad.
That's basically the power of cold showers for you. max confidence and sheer fucking willpower boys.
"I’ve been riding motorcycles for 20 years without any major incident.  A lot of my friends are similar.  I’ve got a handful of bad stories but they mostly weren’t being defensive riders or were just being outright asshats.   I’ve also got some scary car, skateboard, rollerblade, boat etc stories."
I have a motorcycle helmet for riding but I also have a Wolf King GT.  A Bungie cord comes in handy for transportation of stuff. Gloves with knuckle protection will definitely be your friend if you crash. And I almost always wear a skateboard shoe or no slip deck shoe.
"Last RSI call I was involved with we had an ED doctor come out with our critical care paramedic - it was a 30YOM who came off a motorised skateboard and had a nasty head injury, agitated and bleeding everywhere. Doc is tubing this dude when this random other doctor walking past sticks his head in and starts trying to get involved."

Damn sorry that happened.  Some asshole crashed his electric scooter into my wife's prime today scratched all the rear bumper too 😭

"and 19.4 million square feet of bike parking spaces, including racks, corrals, and secure bike parking, bike share, e-bike, and e-scooter docks, and other micromobility uses, so that Citi Bike access will finally stretch citywide and nearly every New York City block will host a bike parking spot;"
"Scooters are way quicker, and they're electric. If you get something with proper wattage (350W+), it will haul ass up the big hills here. Whereas on a bike you would have to expend decent energy. However, a bike would actually allow you to get some exercise while you're commuting. Also, like the other commenter said, if you have back to back classes, I guarantee you'll be on time with a scooter, whereas a bike you would have to unlock, ride to class (less manoeuvrability in dense crowds, especially around the Sather gate area) then find a place to lock it again. It's gonna be a pain in the ass."
"But really you should wear a helmet on a bike, ebike, skateboard, eboard, etc. All it takes is one bad hit and speed isn't the only factor. Just wear the fucking helmet people."
Internationally TSLA is #1 bought GameStop is #2 this has been the report for as long as I’ve tracked it
"Yes to parking and a lot of other things... like recently I went to a doctor's office for appointment only to find the nearest handicapped parking was way on the other side of the building... I had to call them and ask a nurse to come out with a wheelchair since I couldn't walk that far. Literally,, there were at least a dozen non-handicapped parking spots closer to the door,,, but no curb cut so I could not use them. At least here there are some stores that will provide (free) an electric scooter with large basket so I can drive around the store and shop... and they will come to my car and bring it to me."
"Now, I wouldn't recommend that everyone take up my lifestyle. It's not a big deal to wear a helmet or some protective gear. But, work on being aware of your surroundings. Study the terrain that you will travel. Know your body and scooter."
That feel when you wake up to TSLA +4.20% 🥰🥰
"When you go to a ride, they'll direct you on where to go and how it works. They'll also ask questions to get you to the right spot. (Haunted Mansion - can you walk on your own and handle stairs? If yes, they send you up the front steps and into the elevator and you'll get your chair back at the exit. If no, they'll take you another way instead.)"
"There are no 'No electric scootering"" clauses."
"This again went down well with many observers. Gerard Pique was pictured in the Spanish media surfing with his family during last September’s international break, while earlier this month young midfielder Riqui Puig was spotted using an electric scooter on a city-centre pavement. Both incidents appeared to go against best practice for professional athletes during the season, but neither faced action from the club."
Long af story geez. I was wheelchair bound for 2 weeks then I forced myself to get around on both casts without crutches and within a month I was walking again. Thankfully im still alive today to bore you all with the details.
"No one ever got a concussion/head injury anytime within the ~10k cumulative miles we put on those 3 boards, but there were plenty of spills - tattered pairs of jeans & shirts."
Why do you think you see more dangerous scooter riders?
and an example in the patent that states why this is an improvement
"I was biking down 42nd and a guy on an electric Citibike ahead of me was about to bike around a bus, when some douche-canoe on his flying fuckstick of doom (e-scooter) plowed on through from the opposite direction at top speed, missing him quite literally by an inch. The Citibiker stumbled so hard I thought they actually crashed for a second."
"When I tell you, even as a cyclist, that I can't stand these things. They're silent, fast, rarely have lights, the riders don't wear helmets, have no regard for safety, and a total sense of entitlement on the road that puts us cyclists to shame. They just blast past you, cutting tight spaces between cars/medians, ugh the number of times I've had to stop because they tried to pass me or another cyclist in front of me, nearly gotten in an accident, and hopped off the scooter frantically, getting in the way even more."

Watching Cooty’s paws move as he sleeps.
Here's the list of things that cops would not be able to engage the occupants of the car about anymore:
Kyle murdered nobody. They were trying to kill him. This would only be a good argument if the mother’s life was in danger.
"I wouldn't say a full Helmet, back protector, crash shorts, knee pads, slide gloves is minimal gear."
When a person ceases to be a child they are able to provide informed consent to accept a higher risk in exchange for fun.
"Design completed, I ordered the remaining things I needed:"
I ve spent the last 6 months teaching my son to skate and some of his wipe outs I’m like yah I’d be done for the day
"People with similar injuries used to tell me it gets better after first 2 years when I was in rehab but I didn't belive them. For me it took a bit longer but it did get better. First day coming home from rehab will always be the worst day of my life, that was the moment I understood there's no way back, this is the new me and I can't get back what I've lost, non of it."
"Let's compare this situation to something else: driving. Firstly let's consider the situation where driver is drunk (illegal) and that leads him to crashing into a pedestrian. This pedestrian now has a kidney failure and it's going to die unless you give them your kidney. So EITHER you don't give them your kidney and going to jail for drunk driving with lethal outcome OR you give them your kidney and going to the jail anyway because drunk driving is illegal but you are getting lesser sentence because death wasn't  an outcome (only great bodily harm). To sum up first example: you are going to jail either way but for more time if you choose not to donate, you are still not forced to donate those organs to the victim. Now let's consider scenario where the crash was caused by car components failure and driver did nothing illegal. Then the driver can just...walk away. They is not bounded in any way to the victim. And even if they decides to donate blood to this victim while they are bleeding out they can stop it anytime. So you have 2 options: compare sex and getting pregnant to criminal activity and give people sentences depending on pregnancy outcome or just accept that sex is legal and people can't loose any of their right because of participating in it. Well, maybe there is a third option: taking your head out out your anus and be consistent without targeting only pregnant women. That means: forced organ, blood and tissue harvesting for people who caused any type of harm that needs such donation. No matter was it intentional, negligence or completely legal. Forced life-saving activities. You made mistake and caused fire because you had faulty electric appliances in your household? Now you need to personally dive into the burning building to save everyone. And of course we need to abolish any self-defense for people who caused the situation. Kyle Rittenhouse should go to jail, right? It's not only about pregnant women. That would make you misogynist and we don't want thatz right?"
If I knew everyone was going to berate me after needing advice for damage from a car crash I wouldn’t have posted lol
"Another big sign of Xavi’s new tighter regime came with the reintroduction of the policy of calling the players together to a hotel before home games. The practice of spending the day together at a hotel had been common during Guardiola’s time as coach, but was phased out under Luis Enrique and not continued by Valverde, Setien or Koeman."
"Like if you’re learning to skateboard and you scrape your knee, if you go running home instead of trying again you won’t become the next Tony Hawk."
"My point is that any lane position is going to be fine when the speed is low and traffic is stopped. Contrary to many on this sub, I actually prefer filtering on the far right, because it keeps me more out of sight of any potential law enforcement that might be lurking. As a moped driver, cars are way more tolerant about a moped filtering up on the right rather than between two lanes. I will occasionally filter in the middle, but I find the use of the shoulder to be of the same quality of safety as traditional lane-splitting."
"I’m not taking away their human rights, they had no right to murder someone else in the first place."
"Luke: Well, let's see. Skateboard... Truck accident... Fire hydrant."
"Your line of argument is simplistic, and when it doesn't work, you resort to insults. I'd love to see less cars on the road. Give me an approach that considers and addresses the risk to bystanders, and I'm for it."
"I wouldn’t mind this, I like Scooter. But Godwin (depending on when returns from injury), Gage, Evans, Gronk(?), Fournette, Perriman, and maybe another RB will all have more targets than Scottie"

"Electric Scooters and skateboards too. I almost got in a bad crash on the Hornby bike lane this week when a dude on an e-skateboard blew by me, then suddenly slammed his brakes on and cut a sharp turn onto a side street right across my path. He and I are both lucky that I have good brakes."
"back in september of this year i was riding one of those electric scooters on a whim. i was wearing shorts and birkenstocks and a tshirt because it was a random impulse thing for my friend and i. we had made it a couple blocks but my scooter would. not. slow. down. like i was pushing the brake but it was broken or something. eventually i lost control and flew off, sliding nine feet down the sidewalk. horrible road rash everywhere. the left side of my face, my left ear, left shoulder, completely covered  both of my knees, and almost tore away an entire part of my right palm. i landed on my left side and dislocated my left shoulder and broke my left elbow. the cherry on top? i’m left handed. i’m only 21 (20 at the time) and still live with my parents. i called my mom as i sat on the cold ass ground concrete. she’s a doctor and i was very clearly in shock, so i was weirdly calm. she didn’t believe me until my friend sent her a picture and asked if we should go to the E.R. mom worked in the E.R for 15 years and she knows the workings well. she said i would probably have to wait for a room forever and also covid would require me to wear a mask over my open wounds, so she just said come home and we’ll go to her clinic in the morning where i won’t have to wait as long and could take the mask off in my room. my friend got me home and up the stairs with a blood trail dripping from all of the road rash. she bandaged me up and put my arm in a sling made of a sheet, gave me some painkillers and sleeping medicine, and laid me down in my bed, and told me to sleep. who the fuck is sleeping soundly after that?"

Personally I distinguish the two by assigning chaotic things to the ADHD and ordered things to the autism. I often feel pulled in both directions. I need and like schedules and routines and knowing what's going to happen ahead of time. I also feel trapped out caged by all those things and crave novelty.
Glad you were OK and I virtually could’ve posted about the same thing if I hadn’t been lucky Mate I suggest the electric bicycle versus the electric skateboard Lots of fun but substantially lower risk of injury
"That's because people hit 30 and give up. I'm almost 39 years old, and I still regularly skateboard, snowboard, ride motorcycles, and work labor intensive jobs."
You could get a full face if you think you will wear one and don't mind the extra discomfort and size. I usually recommend the giro one as it is sufficient for around 20mph. As a bike helmet is it the best you can get without going full face for chin protection. I rather people wear a bike helmet rather than nothing.
Questions:
I agree that TSLA is overpriced but they are already down 20% from like 2 weeks ago. That might have been the correction.
"Honestly, it can be tricky too.  They will ride up on a scooter and try to snatch it from you.  The problem with this is potential injury as the camera is looped around your neck.  Best advice is to have your friends cover your sides...and be alert.  Take a look around before taking that shot, then put the camera away.  Don't try to be the International Press Team."
"However, if your problem is that cars go dangerously fast, and the danger of a crash is high... motorcycle riders have more vulnerability, but a motorcycle still can have quite a bit more kinetic energy than a bicycle both in terms of mass and velocity. And, even 500 cc can go quite fast. Still a win compared to cars, but not much of one (although it gets better the smaller you go, and 50 cc in some countries is treated as compatible with bicycles)."

"oh, I have  made a list ( this was inspired by Duncan Macmillian and Jonny Donahue's Play, ""Every Brilliant Thing"" & I highly recommend you watch). So here is my list of every brilliant thing:"
This is a pretty bad comparison. Miles driven or hours driven is so much higher than miles skated or hours skated that you can hardly compare them 1:1.
scar on my wrist on the outside by the ball bone thing. Unknown how I got it.
This made me realize they could've literally flipped those stupid poles and the concrete wall. Put the wall where the poles are and vise-versa. Then you at least run the risk of bike/scooter/skateboard crashing into pedestrians vs cars into people.
"Question 3: How do I pick a spot to ride? Do I need to take into account the grade of the road? Do I need to scout it out for cracks and shit? Do I need to have an end spot planned that will have me slowing down on an uphill or something? There is a small mountain that my college is basically built on that I'm thinking would be fun to ride on, but I don't know if it's a good/safe place to ride/learn."
Ya
My fucking parents are like this and it makes me livid.
"That’s absolutely false and you should never tell anyone that modifying a Protective helmet does not increase risk for injury unless you want to accept responsibility for someone’s debilitating head injury or death. The article you linked is talking about attaching a camera or Bluetooth audio device which is done with adhesive tape, not CUTTING holes in a helmet. The entire structural integrity of the helmet is ruined and useless for protection."
"For the recent Espanyol and Benfica home games, Barca have used the NH Constanza, a chain more popular with business travellers (and journalists on a budget, The Athletic knows well). This was another message in itself for the players — no more lenience, no more pampering. It was now about the bare essentials, working hard and earning every crumb. Those who do not like this idea, or still want an easy ride, will be told to get off."
"The issue with the IRT trains (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) is that they are fairly narrow.  They are only 8 feet wide vs the 10 feet width of the letter trains.  So people will definitely notice a scooter and especially a bike when the train is crowded."

Trump and Pence endorsed the Lordstown Endurance. The Endurance and the WKHS NGDV are built on the same skateboard.
"The man and woman responsible for the dog were were today jailed for a total of seven years. The court heard harrowing victim impact statements from Jack's mother and father.

"He tried to punch me lol, after that i said alright time to go bud. He starts storming out the door. He got to the end of the parking lot and it dawned on me."
emergency dismounts.  You will fall - a LOT at first…learn how to do a controlled bail so you’re not dumping the euc every time you abort a maneuver.  This means having a plan to execute a maneuver and having a back up plan on what to do if you can’t.  For me this meant jumping off with both feet while simultaneous palming the trolley handle of my V11 so it stayed up.  My V11 has a motor disengage button under the handle so I couldn’t grab it (or it became a dead weight with no ability to balance fore or aft).
Reminds me of that wheelchair dude making a huge crash on a gigantic skateboard ramp.
I was 42 when I started skateboarding. I don't feel any real restrictions but I also don't want to do super spectacular stuff.
"I had a weird experience recently and it cost me.  I tried to scalp AAPL and my stop loss was not recognized (I 100% placed the order) and I was left holding the stock at the end of the day. It dropped about 4% and I decided to purchase additional shares up to 100 and sell a call against it until it could come back up.  Then the massacre happened and suddenly I was down $1,000.  What do you think would have been the correct course of action?"
"Agree with lane splitting too as long as care is taken when doing so, which I believe the official stance here is anyway."

"Natas's name backwards is Satan and parents thought his name was like the satanic panic heavy metal records played backwards thing so they protested. He responded by releasing a satanic deck. He's Swedish or something. Natas isn't satanic, it was a traditional name. It was silly. That's the deck Eazy is holding."
"Looking at converting 25 percent of the space currently devoted for cars into space for people, here is one vision of what New Yorkers could have instead:"
Something similar to this I probably saw on reddit was someone who had just done and interview about their electric scooter and I think was using a crossing and a car went directly into them.
"Fortunately drunk teenagers are immortal, so they weren't seriously injured and were able to run off leaving me with a $600 bill to fix my bike."
May there be a Crank in all of you.
"Eventually he got kicked out one day when he started opening paint, huffing it, and proceeded to whack people with his walking stick while he was speeding by them on his scooter."
"Not an LIRR rider, but I used to ride around Queens before moving to the island. I personally loved my switch from scooter to electric unicycle. It takes longer to learn, but once you get the hang of it, it's far superior. I've crashed so hard because of the tiny wheels of the scooter. My unicycle has an 18 inch wheel, which can go over bumps and cracks in the roads. I used to ride it 20 miles back and forth to work too. Not a problem with the bigger battery. They also makes smaller ones that have like 10 inch wheels that can fit in a backpack."
Best of luck in your recovery.
"Finally, the highlight show of the week was The Crash Reel on iPlayer. I knew a bit about Kevin Pearce but no the true extent of everything that happened. Definitely a 10/10 watch for me. Very good and also very sad."
"Winona, meanwhile, will set pits of gel around the arena to trap cars that try driving around. If she’s using the wrecked cars… well, F1 famously doesn’t do well on rough terrain. And for smaller objects turned into cars, these will just get stuck inside the gel pits. Driving around on Persephone won’t be as big an issue, seeing as Winona is already quite skilled in navigating close quarters."
Failure to ride a bicycle as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway. (Cal. Veh. Code § 21202(a))
"“Hi, look you need to put me on air. I’ve got an announcement to make. The city’s in imminent danger and so is the President,” I said. The taxi driver turned down the music and looked at me with concern through the rear view mirror."
"It’s impossible to have a car-less society. After all, people would still crash even if they rode bicycles or scooters. Removing cars may not change much..."
"Why, it is true. You can fuck someone up simply by crashing into them with your body. But of course we don't police that because the amount of care and the likelyness of serious harm is much reduced compared to riding a bicycle or a scooter. But such as well the amount of care and the likelyness of danger between both of those are also reduced compared to driving a car."
"Just like you will crash on a skateboard, you will crash when skiing, etc"

"So the more control of a vehicle we have the larger the potential for amazing feats that we have, but also the larger the ability to fail to natural human error."
"So, that's about $0.28 in powder, $0.08 for the primer, and $0.27 for the projectile, which, if my mathemagician skills are true, comes to about $0.63/ea. Meanwhile, you were getting a box of... 20 for $29, right? That's about $1.45/ea or so?"

"I now realize that lateral pressure, not unlike what the OP is applying to his feet, is happening to me as well and is responsible for the pain in the blade of that foot."
I slow down for junctions like you would on the road.
"You would have no expectation of a vehicle travelling at speed on a footpath, neither would any reasonable person, the accident is almost certainly down to the scooter operator . I would take the view that you owe him nothing, and if he wants to pursue it, ask him to report the incident to police at which point he's admitting operating a motor vehicle on the pavement without license, MOT or insurance."

When I went to school for programming (2009-2012) a lot of my class were second career type people. Probably related to the recession and people losing jobs.
"In canicross, which is probably the most similar, we do not generally run the dogs on hard surfaces due to the issues above. They are generally kept on dirt trails providing more cushioned running."

"Can't comment on your situation in Blackwell, but most scooters are probably small enough that you could fold them up and put it under your bed or something."
"In conclusion, this project was awesome. I love my Pint more than ever. Working on this taught me so much and I highly recommend to try it yourself if, like me, you are an electronic enthusiast."

"Sickly Sweet Demise! - It’s inevitable that Errok is going to “break something apart” with that meaty arm of his, even if it's human flesh. When that occurs she’ll telekinetically control the fragments to tear off tiny bits of flesh from the arm before it can retract, then launch the bits into another explosion that sends them flying into… some cream pies on the catering table? These pies, conveniently already charged with explosive potential (and maybe tactically spread around the map if Erok seems intent on vandalizing the tables early) wait patiently for Lomo to respawn before blasting for his face! As the creampie ‘breaks apart’ upon his visage, she’ll telekinesis the cream to carry the small piece of Errok down Lomo’s throat, force feeding him a putrid meal. He’ll stumble around like drunk, completely hapless as a second pie smashes into his face, making the poor man fall on his neck in a shower of whipped cream and swamp meat."

"This is incorrect, actually. Until (presumably) the new Model Ys coming off the line in Ausitin right now, every Tesla ever made carried the battery pack as cargo, not as structure. The battery pack added rigidity to the structure, but it wasn't part of the structure."
"Be careful on unknown roads, go slower then usual. Be very careful or avoid skating during rain. Always watch the road for obstacles. And constantly anticipate the traffic ahead of you and what might happen."
In Denmark some time ago it became a legal requirement to wear a helmet on an e-scooter but it's not a requirement on a bike and i kinda dislike that in part because of this irony.
"They are a dog. A normal dog with normal social preferences out for a walk. The vast majority of dogs, particularly socially mature adult dogs, do not want to romp with every dog that crosses their path & very few dogs do well being rushed by off-leash dogs when they are on leash. That’s it. There does not have to be anything at all wrong with or out of the ordinary about a dog for them not to want unknown dogs rushing up to them in public, on-leash designated areas. That’s not an example of what appropriate social interaction looks like. Period."
"Honestly, I'd be pretty happy if my city promoted bikes and scooters, even electric ones, in favour of cars. I know much of the city centre is planned to go car-free this decade, I wonder if they'll consider allowing two-wheelers in the bike lanes."

The 21-year-old previously played the 2021 USL2 season with PDX FC before joining Tormenta 2 and was also a student-athlete with the Michigan Wolverines and was an Academic All-Big Ten player in 2020.
Which is killing it.
"The short answer is that the right motorcycles can be a solution, but they're definitely not the solution."
also don’t forget balance exercises…mount the EUC while supported by a railing and just rock it back and forth to train your brain to find the points where the motor engages.  Try to balance on one foot and see how long you can do it and do this for both legs.
I continued walking in the opposite direction of the taxi and pulled out the yellow envelope. I ripped it open and pulled out the paper inside. I stopped and frowned at the text in front of me. The name registered to the account was LaMDA. It didn't mean anything to me.
"Due to the parallel connection being made before the BMS, the board needs to be turned on before the external battery is plugged in, or I would get an “incompatible hardware error”. Having the switch makes the turn on sequence very easy"
"I will say overall getting a onewheel has been awesome and I don’t regret it at all. I’ve got some new parts coming in to change the color and I’m looking forward to learning how to ride better. It’s also exercise for me, which I’d been notoriously bad with in the past, so it’s even helping me in that regard. I found out I was completely out of the loop on gas prices recently because I just onewheel everywhere now. It’s been great lol."
"In a slightly more awkward story I was out with some friends in high school, guy friend was driving, I'm riding passenger, back seat was a girl and a younger kid we all knew from my neighborhood.  I think we might have been drinking at some point because I don't really remember the details of how things got like this, maybe some kind of truth or dare situation, but as some point she climbs forward from the back seat and basically starts trying to give the driver road head. While she's doing that reaches over and starts giving me a handy, and our friend in the back seat was just losing his mind as this was way outside the level of things he was used to."
Skate videos were cool. The first video I saw was Oceanside which was a contest but skate companies like Powell and Santa Cruz put out full feature videos and a lot of the music was punk rock.
"The electric scooter debate rages hard here as well, folks throwing them off of bridges and getting in fatal crashes. They finally migrated far enough away from the city center that they're littering my neighborhood now lol. Just sad robot carcasses all over."
"Made my way threw the neighborhoods that I knew so well, and I didn't stop running until I was totally out of sight and breath, and luckily I was all ready like 8 minutes away from where I stayed so I kept walking and walking and finally I made it home, and when I got in, I saw through the creeks of the curtains a couple cop cars driving by the neighborhood and I was holy shit, thank god I made it right on time 🤣"
Any sit down scooter is too wide to go in the bike lane. It’s so wide that it’s unsafe for them to pass a bike or a bike to pass them. The path is too narrow for such a wide vehicle. Regardless if it’s electric or not.

"Red uses her smoke to cloud the arena: This may work out better for us than for her. If she begins to release her smoke, while she’s visible Ravee will move in early to punch Red and plant tracking gel on her, allowing for her and Winona to keep track of the racer as she moves about. Red herself, however, will not have the same advantage and be effectively blinding herself to our location. That said, not being able to monitor her actions and the cars that SCB produces is an issue, so Ravee will try and get behind any smoke clouds she makes so she can properly scout Red."
"There's a lot of intersections that have a stop sign, and those are usually in places where there were accidents in the past. Some of them have perfectly good visibility, but some people just don't see a car coming at them. They certainly won't see a cyclist. This is important, because it is the cyclist that is protected by having them give way to cars."
"Name a stock in history that ever came close to being as over valued as the TSLA bubble.   Guys, it’s a car company. You ever ride an electric scooter? Yeah, that’s basically a small version of a TSLA and you guys bid it up to a trillion dollars. You can stop now."

"-  The Unagi is a nice choice, but everyone seems to regard it as the iPhone of scooters in a derisive way.  Meaning that it's stylish, but overpriced for what you get compared with other scooters.  Besides its styling, its main draw is its light weight and its decent power for its small motor.  But its drawback is that it have very little range compared with other scooters."
"The court heard Hayden, of Penyrheol, Caerphilly, became the owner of the 100lb dog on November 3 2021 after answering an advert on Facebook offering it free to a good home, stating that it had issues with other dogs.

"If you fall off you now have several kgs of uncontrolled ""projectile"" heading for bystanders who didn't head out this morning prepared for a scooter injury."
"Safety. Gear. Trust us: you WILL crash at some point. Best to have it be just a scare, rather than a potentially life-altering injury!"
"As for nannying, that wouldn’t be much of a problem if e.g. you were only asked to keep an eye on an older kid for a few hours while they watch TV. But generally nannying demands much more than this and nannying is usually for younger children. Caring for a young child in an environment that isn’t specifically adapted for you to do so is very challenging for someone who requires mobility aids."
"There's a lot of valid things to criticize Tesla about, I'm pretty open about the things that are quirky or stupid, the lack of rear cross traffic alert is mine."
"I had only bruises though, but they hurted and I was just so freaking hurt and too exhausted to even talk to give them any information besides my first name and a fake address so they said they'll come back around the morning to get the rest and see how things will go and if got better."
That’s not true.
"Context matters here, but you are completely ignoring how there are trade-offs with bicyclists."
"Do you mean a mountain biking helmet? It does sound somewhat unpleasant. Also, bike helmets are designed to take one high speed crash while skateboard helmets are designed to take multiple slower speed hits."
"also please check local laws, many places in the US allow you to drive small scooters/mopeds on a normal driver's license. Others require a learner's motorcycle permit. Some may not require a license at all. In my state, anything going over i believe 20 requires a Driver's License, anything over 30 or 35  requires a motorcycle endorsement of some sort."
"Not a favourite episode but there are 2 moments that make me laugh just thinking about them. 1) when Amy, Tammy and Michael almost had the car accident and Tammy went flying into the back of Amy’s seat. I don’t find the almost accident part funny but I always think it is karma for how horrible Tammy is to Amy and Michael. Also it should have been a wake up call that if you are too far to put a seat belt on and sit in a car properly and safely, then you need to get your life together. 2) when michael was putting their mums electric scooter back in the trailer before the meet and greet, and he didn’t put the bar back up. He hit the ramp and almost went over the bars."
"I don't have an E-bike or electric motorcycle/scooter yet, but the above seem to be some of the better options to me."
"I'm pretty baffled by your stance on updates though. The update I just got overnight was a recall over the playing of sounds with the pedestrian warning speaker. That was ""fixed"" on my car overnight with a software update requiring only me to click a button while I brushed my teeth. I don't see how that's not superior to a dealership software update in every possible way."

"But immortality doesn't erase your student loans. Your landlord doesn't care that if you were to cut off your own arm, it would grow back like a gecko's severed tail.

And I wasn't."
"He shot him because he lunged for the weapon and got his hand around the muzzle, after previously expressing in explicit terms that he would kill him if he found him alone (supported by both multiple witness testimonies as well as injury patterns from his autopsy). I don’t believe there was a rock involved. The object he threw was established to have been a bag with some unclear contents if I remember correctly."
"But it wasn't long before I found a listing on Craig's List that, back when I was mortal and gainfully employed, I would have thought ridiculous. Maybe it was the hunger. Maybe it was the fact that my work experience was so specialized, I couldn't even get a job at a restaurant. Whatever the reason, the listing WANTED: HUMAN CRASH TEST DUMMY PAID WEEKLY felt like a god send."
"calisthenics is the opposite of machines. its much harder to isolate, but we build real world, practical strength, applicable to our feats. we are almost always building groups, rather than muscles. also the associated tendons, ligaments, joints, etc. we are far less prone to injury. the caveat is we are totally responsible to enforce good form. it is a skill...much like form needed to play guitar riffs, or to do skateboard tricks."
"Now, I'm thinking I want to start getting into maybe some downhill riding. Nothing crazy; I eventually want to learn how to safely and intentionally power slide (once I can get a board with harder wheels designed for it), but not yet. I'll start by just learning how not to die first."

"Your cringe take is fair. I spent nearly 10 years from 8-18 give or take, skateboarding around downtown Kingston. Bombing hills, dropping large stair set etc. All of which was extremely dangerous, most of my friends broke multiple bones and had lots of hospital visits. I never got much more than a bruise though. Through my 20-30s I also had several friends get arrested for drunk driving and or get into bad accidents. I only had one accident, I was at a stand-still in a merge lane when a bus clipped me. My life is awesome. In reply to your last comment, my electric skateboard is neither an e-bike, nor a scooter. In the city of Toronto, I've done extensive research and as far as I've been able to tell, it is a skateboard. Skateboards must be used on city sidewalks, unless crossing a street at an intersection. However in the past 3 years I've blasted past so many police cars that never even batted an eye or looked my way. So, even if you were correct about my board being illegal, I'd still ride it every day bc just like jay-walking, they don't give a crap about it."

"I actually found that my baseline improved after I got a puppy because when she was young I was having to carry her downstairs once an hour to take her outside. I was exhausted at first, but walking 15m twice an hour actually built up my strength/fitness. I also found that getting a car (with a blue badge) increased my baseline a bit as rather than going on my scooter where I'd remain on the scooter, I could park right by a venue and walk that tiny amount. I'm not talking about levels of walking where I wouldn't need a scooter to do things I want to do, I use my scooter pretty much everyday. I just mean it's easy when first getting the scooter to lose a bit of your current level. I think for me it was somewhat worse at first because being in the scooter around others I felt this social pressure not to get up and walk around at points. Because you look disabled on the scooter, everyone expects you to stand up and look frail. I don't look remotely frail when I walk around (unless I'm crashing or have gone over my limit), so I felt almost guilt for not looking that way which can make you bound to the scooter. Now I've had my scooter about a year and a half and I do not care what others think, I am not bound to my scooter when I go out, it is a mobility aid, that is all."
No that was a skateboard accident

"personally, as weird as it may be to some, everytime I go faster than I can run, I will think to myself ""if I crash here, I will be thrown at the road at this speed.. is it worth it?"". this thinking makes sure I only attempt high speeds on roads im comfy on (hence why litterally all my top speed tests are on the same stretch of road). I also always plan an 'escape route' of sorts. if there's a fence next to me? im not going fast because I dont wanna be thrown into that. if there's grass though? I can steer/jump into that if I fuck up, so I'm more comfortable pushing high speeds. I am always aware of just how dangerous it is what I'm doing, and it keeps me from getting too comfortable. and this is especially important now that I have a board that can push 40 mph with ease. if I had to give people a tip, its to always realize that you can crash at any moment, and to think to yourself wether or not you'll be okay if you crash. if you think you'll be fine, keep going, sure. but if you think to yourself ""I wont be okay if I fall here"", then please slow down."
"And I was in there cause I crashed an electric street rental scooter somehow when I wasn't looking, and I woke up in an ambulance van, and I was yelling at them to take me home, not cause I was going crazy but cause I was actually scared and scared of the bill i was gonna get lol."
Roommate has crashed a ton from his husky being ahead of him (pulling or loose) and darting off the trail. She nearly killed me when i tried to get her to pull me on skateboard .. never have issues running her beside my bike or beside my skateboard. I trained my akita to pull on harness and side-by-side on collar so he would pull my grocery cart and wagon but not pull me by skateboard or bike. I was able to bike and skate and onewheel with both of them together regularly.
"Not victim shaming, I believe the onus to prevent an accident is almost exclusively with the operator of a metric ton of steel and plastic, but on top of our horrific car issues, this city has a secondary problem of terrible electric scooter operators that officers should be ticketing."
"I'd prefer if the roads were designed to avoid such conflict between road users of such differing mass and speed, because a simple moment of carelessness shouldn't be a death sentence. But that's not the situation we're in, and so I'll coninue to bang on about not going down the left of large vehicles in the meantime."
"Bloodstained Glass! - When those fancy stained glass windows inevitably are shattered - either through Errok’s efforts or Marissa’s own - she telekinetically puppets the glass into guillotine blades that let loose towards Lomo whilst she launches him into their path with either frags or explosions! He’ll slip, fall, and get sliced into pieces!"
"Full time when user and long time Disney fan here. If you are going to rent a scooter at the parks, definitely rent a car.  If you are gonna rent a scooter from a 3rd party, then don't.  Busses at Disney may be pretty empty for bipeds, but they are not for us on the quadracylcic side of the fence.  Even in the emptiest seasons, I have easily waited over 90 minutes for a bus with an empty spot."
My guess is that when the camera turned away maybe the dude kicked the young boy’s blue skateboard that was laying there. You could kind of hear something crash in the background before everyone said “oooooohhhh”
"Riding is optional for me; I have a car. If I wanted to maximize safety at all costs, I could drive."
A couple just like you two with new scooters:
"Plus, even if the pavement is not designated for bike use, it's pretty commonly accepted that kids are allowed to ride on the pavement, so I'd be surprised if you aren't deemed responsible if you hit a kid riding on the pavement with your car."
The sound of seagulls and waves crashing.
"The downward tilt of these angled side rails allows for an approximately one-half inch drop in the center of gravity of the one-wheeled electric skateboard. This allows for a significant improvement in the stability and safety of the one-wheeled electric skateboard. The upward tilt then brings the front and rear bumpers back up to the same level as with the straight frame rails, thereby making the angled rails lose little to no clearance whatsoever in relation to the straight frame rails."
"There are already many similar laws protecting drivers on the books. For example, laws and regulations requiring: crumple zones, seat belts, air bags, mirrors, firewalls, safe shatter windows, headlights, brakes and crash tests to be done on all passenger vehicles on the road. Helmets aren’t required but you’re surrounded by a literal ton of steel and aluminum lined with airbags and crumple zones required by law to allow your fragile body to travel safer."
"Once training starts, there has also been a new, more intense feel to the sessions, now led by the team’s new physical preparation specialist Ivan Torres. A childhood friend of Xavi in the Catalan town of Terrassa, Torres has previously worked as fitness coach at Bahrain’s Olympic side, AEK Larnaca and Leeds United before joining Xavi at Al-Sadd."
Here's a good documentary on old school skaters.
TSLA is going to the moon 26’ of January
And its a stupid reason. There is no logic-based reason an electric bicycle does not need a license and insurance but an electric scooter does.
Final step was the BMS configuration and finding the right battery discharge protection while riding. It took me several rides and some readings but I think I got it right now.
"“Cruyff’s philosophy is very good, but Cruyff’s way of working might not work too well in today’s football,” says the source. “Everything has changed a lot at the top level in the last 10 years. And these people are younger but they are very, very prepared and experienced, aware of what is going on at the top level outside — tactically, technically, technologically.”"
I got my GoTrax GXL V2 for about $300.
The light on above the stove in the kitchen at night.
"I don't know anything about your sail design.  As a sailboarder, it seems like the sail isn't practical.  You want to be able to keep the board with you, what about the sail?  How big is your sail?  Do you have to construct the sail or is it a solid piece?  If you must assemble the sail, how long does that take?  How much does it weigh?  How durable is it?  Then there's the wind.  What about at night?  Don't know your windy area (although it might be interesting as a sailboarder), but wind often dies in the evening and doesn't come back up until late morning.  What about variations in wind speed?  Sailboarders have a quiver of sails and select the size of ""wind catcher"" (sail) based on wind speed.  Gusty conditions are a struggle.  And when sailboarders fall, we splash.  When you fall, you will crash.  (Back to item #1).  Then there's wind direction.  You cannot sail directly upwind. You can work your way up wind by tacking back and forth at an upward angle toward the wind, but it's a lot of extra distance side to side and a lot of extra time.  (Google tacking).  And here's the big problem.  Just because it's windy, doesn't mean wind will hit your sail.  You'll need to be in the open for that.  No buildings, no trees, no hills, etc.  For fun in open field maybe.  Maybe transportation in a desert flat.  But generally, probably not.  All of that is only an extrapolation from sailboarding so I could be wrong.  The board itself may still be a fine choice for some conditions."
I know Justin Scott and Travis from Bird. They aren't interested in actually engaging with these problems.
Bulloch EMS transported the 20 year old male to EGRMC in critical condition. They reported that the man had been hit by a car while riding a lime scooter.
Behind the BMS: connection made in parallel of the stock battery.
"And, if your problem is tailpipe pollution, welp. ICE motorcycles are held to significantly less strict standards than cars for cost reasons, especially when smaller displacement (if you're under 280 cc, you can still meet the US standards with a carburetor, which hasn't been a thing in the US since ~1994, although European standards finally caught up to the late 2000s for cars in 2021), and have horrific criteria pollutant emissions compared to cars. Air quality is horrific in motorcycle-dominant areas, as a result. (CO2 emissions... well, that depends on the motorcycle.)"
"TSLA is bought by above average income person. They re constrained by capacity, not that they lack buyers.   They will sell as many cars as they can make."
We got invited to a punk house after a show because these people needed a ride home. It was this old fucked up house covered in gig posters and toys and crap all over the place. It was dirty but really cool and the people that lived there were a bit older but super nice to us and kind of took us under their wings.
"As a teenager there were dozens of times I had to hide under a bed or in a closet or in a bathroom shower and then sneak out back doors or climb out windows to escape when some girl's single parent came home from work.  Sometimes it was exciting, like when you realize this hot girl's mom is also a ridiculously hot stripper, other times it was much less fun like when you realize this girl's dad who just rolled in is a cop and you are hiding in a closet praying he doesn't think you are a home intruder."
"Bro he popped his left arm out of his socket and needed a wee breather. I do this on the regular (old skateboard injury). Hurts like a bitch, but you can pop it back in, rub it for a bit, then be off on your merry way. You just become more aware of what actions set it off, for example, reaching into the back seat while I'm driving will do it for me. Hope that's all it is! The rest of his set was 🔥"
I think it's more the wheels being larger helps a lot for control and crash ratio for riders.
"Tesla engineering has proved that to make the most efficient vehicle possible for its size, price, and purpose, vertical integration and consideration need to be taken for every aspect of the vehicle. You can't just have a generic skateboard you bolt a body on top of."
"Hot Potato! - As she runs, she’ll pull the pin from one of her grenades and toss it toward Lomo as though directing him to catch it. Yet she’ll accidentally throw it just short of him, letting it bounce between his legs, detonating violently behind him. Right as his corpse hits the floor, she’ll make a final leap towards him so she can tackle him to the ground, launching into an epic combo-  Wait. Did we say corpse? Right… those aren’t really going to work at the same time, are they?"
Rent an electric scooter! 🛵
"“Well fuck, what the hell do we do now then?”"
"Just wanna pop my 2 cents in. Here in Germany the max speed on e scooters is 20 Kph (roughly 12 mph) we have cobble stone roads all around us. Sometimes a road will be pavement and turn into cobble stone. I was riding on my way to the zoo , and a lady hit the edge of a piece of cobblestone just right and was wearing a helmet, and flew off her scooter. All I can say is there was blood every where. I stopped to help her until paramedics arrived. She was disoriented, kept asking me what happend, asked me if she was in her scooter, where all the blood came from ect. She has a nasty concussion! A huge gash on her face. Her clothing was ripped denim pants and luckily she had knee pads and elbow pads. This woman was battered! Her skin in some spots where the holes were was… well it wasn’t there anymore."
"I was a product of the “here’s a skateboard, figure it out” style of teaching. I think actual classes at first would have been great because instead of learning to ride “correctly” I ended up basically inventing street luge. I’d get rides or hike to the tops of California coastal mountain roads like Kanan Dume Rd, where I would lay down on the board and go faster than the cars, like 80 mph wearing jeans and Vans and it’s a miracle I never died…. I went through a pair of shoes in one or two rides also, since they were my brakes. On flatter ground, instead of laying in my beach and going feet first, I would lay on my stomach and “paddle” with my arms to propel myself. Having my face inches over the roadway offered a good sense of speed but I learned that this was not a good position from which to crash, and still have the scar in my chin from that metal sprinkler head…"
Bruh. Have you ever heard of Agile Development?
"I started scheming in my mind, and said okay I have all my clothes and phone beside me, and was in those dress like hospital outfits."
"It's like a skateboarding place. So it's safer that there are no people in that space. If there are too many people, they will crash into the skateboard."
I’ve scolded former coworkers who grumbled when someone who “didn’t seem disabled” got out of their car while we were out at lunch. It’s beyond frustrating.
"My dad even downhill skated with us, and had to crash into a neighbor's yard to stop recently."
My program had a lot of drop outs but I think the older guys all graduated. They had jobs lined up. This was a serious goal for them whereas a younger person may still be figuring things out.
Anecdote: before Covid a news bulletin made the rounds about a man who was allegedly speaking to (elementary school age) children on their way to and from school.
"Others moved quickly to adapt to the new circumstances. Pique cancelled a scheduled TV appearance to promote the Davis Cup, one of his many outside business interests, which would have involved a day away in Madrid while he was recovering from a calf injury."
"In this case, the electric scooter wasn't invisible, so would have been seen if the OP had been looking at the pavement. From the OP initial description, ""didn't see them"", implies they weren't paying attention because again, it would be visible at the fact the crash happened. OP also has a higher duty of care as he was turning off the road, wheras from how his description sounds, the scooter was continuing on it's path."
"You'll need some form of weighing device. An electronic scale, a kitchen scale, whatever, but it has to be accurate and reliable. A fish scale will not do. You need to be somewhat precise when it comes to gun powder."
"heck, an electric skateboard can already move as fast as 40kph."

"Man, I would love a sequel to that movie, set in present day and just as campy"
"“HeXen,” indeed an Activision Blizzard property, is a cult hit first-person game about using magic spells. Microsoft’s pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard also means owning the rights to many creations from gaming’s past, including Crash Bandicoot, the original Sony PlayStation mascot. There’s also the influential and popular Tony Hawk skateboard series and beloved characters like Spyro the Dragon."
"I personally only filter/lane share when traffic is fully stopped. I lane share at very low speeds, probably under 10mph."
"Took the elevator, walked out the other side of the emergency room and started walking casually and a security guard told me to stop and that your committing a crime, but it was some old man, who was the only guard around at that time especially since it was like 2am all ready."
NASDAQ:AAPL / 70
So no thanks! I will always wear everything.
"Helmet and wrist guards are kind of the minimum. I'd consider a set of skateboard knee+elbow pads, on top of that, to be basic protection. An offroad motorcycle jacket like the Fox Titan or Alpinestars Bionic [Tech or Action or whatever] and motocross knee/shin guards would be full protection, pretty much, at least at those speeds. It's kind of surprising, but it seems like bad shoulder and rib injuries mostly happen at lower speeds, so that's why I would still consider the ridiculous armor jacket even at 18mph."
I decide to build a skateboard.
"Hunger clawed at my insides and the spot where I'd taken a chunk out of my arm that morning ached with phantom pain. Hurling myself at a wall didn't seem as bad compared to self-cannibalism. ""You got a pen?"""
"As the pair quickly drive by the pit stop, Ravee will use her free hands to grab onto any loose objects on the benches: car hubcaps and water bottles are prioritized, but if Ravee can carry it, she’ll grab it. After grabbing what they can, the two will turn their sights back onto the track, where the rest of their plan will take place. Provided Red isn’t running towards them with reckless abandon, they take refuge behind a car for a few seconds. With this brief moment of pause, Winona gels several of the hubcaps she’d taken and forms them into a board-like shape; a hubcap skateboard, if you will. While in the initial stages of the fight Ravee will use this board primarily to escape and keep safe from Red, later on it will serve as a mobility tool."
"Okay since it's a One wheel and not a skateboard I'll put this story here, which will probably never be seen. I had a One wheel and I was feeling cocky so I went out with a beer and called my friend and planned on lazily cruising and boozing and flapping my gums in front of my house"
"Speaking of ramps, they open up a whole new door of maneuverability! By making curving structures of pieces that hold position at A POW, and tapping into her natural sense of timing to form these at the right time, she can curve her pew-board off floating constructs as she desires to make sudden, unpredictable turns!"
There's always an anarchistic period that comes with disruption. The bad faith actors try to prolong it while people like me advocate for new equitable classifications.
"In ON ( the fault determination rules for auto accidents are provincially regulated), if there is any accident between a vehicle and a pedestrian, the vehicle is held at fault 100% of the time, unless the pedestrian is charged by police."
"I'm mostly just cruising around, plus I use it for commuting when I was in BGC and also did some group rides pre-pandemic."
Still need some space for crash structure.
Both of these two are at fault but boy is that car driver distracted.
Cost: $450 - $500
"Not that I wish ill, but my hope is that 1) they do not procreate [we need fewer dumb people] and 2) my tax dollars aren't needed to help them if/when they crash.  This applies not only to motorcycles, but bicycles and now those electric scooters.   These should help our gene pool in the long run."

(New York Daily News) In a letter filed in court Tuesday, lawyers working for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams criticized Molina’s absence from the meeting on the Nunez class action lawsuit over the city’s use of force in its jails.

"Hi all, this might be a long one, with multiple questions. I just got my first board (minus a skateboard I had when I was like 10 that I rode for a total of like 2 hours) about a month ago. It's a DB Longboards Mini Cooper 33"". I've mostly been using it to commute around campus. But there are also a few spots on campus that, when nobody is walking to class, are really fun to cruise down and carve through with some speed regulation. There is one spot I was actually accidentally power sliding through which sent me flying (though landing on my feet running) even though the wheels are 78a hardness. I eventually I figured out it was because of a layer of dirt on the asphalt from some construction on campus."
Instead they throw money at subsidizing grand projects like green planes and stuff like that while completely ignoring low-hanging fruit and building new highways and having still a lot of unelectrified rails. Apparently our rails not being very electrified meant we had limited options in what model of trains we could buy which meant many years ago we had a giant scandal about our expensive 106 broken mainly IC4 trains we bought from Italy that were massively delayed because they were so badly built they broke immediately upon beginning service. They learnt from that mistake and have continually been electrifying more and more rail since and is now trying again with IC5 electric boogaloo edition so we can finally take our IC3 trains out of service 💀. These grand political projects are a shit idea. If they didn't buy 106 trains at once we would never have had such terrible problems and burnt so much money.
"Moving away from that for a moment the color blue representing sadness is a simple idea and it feels innate to link the two, but being able to capture visually how the abstraction of a color tinges your lived-in experiences and emotions stemming is anything but simple to pull off and that’s one of Blue’s biggest assets. Your mind drifting off due to defense mechanisms in place to cope with pain and the impressions you get while you’re away being linkable to the stimulus of a color is something so unspeakably identifiable. This isn’t a very information driven movie but one that basks and ruminates in the consequences of the scenario. The associations of the mind are a pretty mysterious thing and this is tapped into beautifully. It’s also done with a soaring operatic musical score where fading out of a conversation is accompanied by it, because the human mind really does go to these primal places as we retreat inward. The movie’s a true etude in mood."
"Ted: Okay okay. Look, the point is you can’t sell that helmet, it’s damaged. Once its been in an accident the foam gets compressed and it's not safe anymore."
Then you're free to use any hardshell backpack you desire to protect your stuff in the event of a crash and it also doubles as a spine protector
it's either it can or cannot be healed.
"The escooter trial is fucked and I'm saying that as an escooter owner. It's like cars weren't a thing in the CBD and suddenly there were hire cars for anyone to use without any experience driving. Shit, when I first bought an electric scooter I went to a quiet area to practise riding so I don't crash or hurt people."
In my town as we have a good cycle path network there are quite a few illegal scooter riders too. But they are all safe from what I see.

First started with a longboard since that's the nicest way to go from A to B. Added a regular skateboard (was a gift) and a surfskate later. Doing some mild hills and pools now and pretty big distances (I think the most was 25km).
The doom and gloom that surrounded the Catalan club through the final stages of Josep Maria Bartomeu’s disastrous presidency has also been replaced by a wave of positivity and optimism — a feeling that despite the club’s huge debts and unbalanced squad they have turned a corner.
"Children are also expected to know how to handle being bored, whereas in the US it seems the pressure is enormous for parents to ""provide stimulating content"" for their children. Of course German children who are bored will whine just as loudly as American children about wanting to use the tablet - but if the parents say ""no"" long enough, then the child learns to find something interesting on their own without being reliant on outside help (e.g. with their peers)."
"Get a scooter if you want portability, prevention from theft (as long as you're willing to bring it everywhere), and haul ass up hills. Hell, I bring my girlfriend on my scooter sometimes, it works pretty well, although I'm pretty sure we make other people cringe so there's that."
"Also heard so many stories of scooter scams where they hold your passport as deposit and then ransome it back to you over some ""major damage"" that materialises. Police always side with the locals."
I rode an electric scooter along the viaduct with a heavy bag without crashing. I even did a skid!
"Similarly, playgrounds are explicitly designed so that children can test their limits at their own pace. They aren't sanitised and ""child-proofed"" to avoid even the slightest risk of injury. Instead, they start small, and encourage the child to see what they feel comfortable with - without parents holding their hand, preferably - and then progress to be ever more ""challenging"" (and therefore ""interesting""). If they fall, they'll scrape their knee, but it's nothing serious, it teaches them what their limits are, and encourages them to push those limits at their own pace. I went to a German indoor playground with a British friend last year, and she couldn't believe we would let children near such a thing - all she knew where the ""soft-play areas"" in the UK, where every surface is covered in soft foam, whereas the German version was all wood and substantial height differences."
It does in the context of being chased down the street by a mob of people talking about how they’re going to kill you.
"So ... It turns off, and I go sailing to the blacktop, beer goes crashing down, phone skids away and I slam my entire side down from like 15mph."
"Tell me u/AllAlder , do you think my dad who proceeds to call me useless and a ""waste of space who has done nothing but freeload off of their generosity"" TILL today since I was 10 years old- really wants the best for me? The man who lifted his hand to me more times than I can count and has silenced my mother into following his word to a T? The man who openly stated he would rather have me die in a car crash than get a fucking 89 instead of a 95 in ONE exam? EVEN THOUGH my overall average in school has never dropped past a 93.4% in years.You think my parents, who can treat strangers who they meet on a daily with genuine respect- but call me a ""worthless bitch who brought shame upon them"" for simply refusing to stop pursuing my hobbies and focus on academics 24/7?I work a part-time job for the sole reason of providing myself with the means to pursue my hobbies and express myself. The number of sketch books they tore/threw out, the number of micro-controllers they broke and the number of times they screamed at me wishing i'd break both my feet falling off my skateboard will never be enough to display the amount of hurt and rejection I feel on a daily basis."
"Healthcare is better than the US, including infant mortality rates."
"-  If you are scootering/biking in an area with hills, and if you're on the heavier side, you may want a more powerful scooter/bike (basic standard motors are around 250W, so aim higher)."
"I was thinking just this morning the cops need to step up and stop ignoring the electric scooter mayhem. I was riding in Prospect park before the sun was up, it was light out but early. And an electric scoot guy going maybe 25-30 was riding the wrong way mid lane just after you get squeezed for the exit below the Great Hill. We do the “who’s going to go left/right dance” and eventually I just stop because he headlight is blinding me and I can’t see where he is looking. We didn’t crash bc I stopped and went around him. I ask him what he’s thinking and he REALLY wants to talk about it, following me towards the rink. Mostly shouting that I should mind my own business.  I’ll admit this issue being one of my largest a pet peeves with living in NYC (the NYPD being the biggest) being told to “mind my own business” when someone has just threatened my life and made it my business blows my mind. He chases me and keep threatening me, I try to draw him to where we can discuss this with a cop. He says he doesn’t care about cops but won’t go talk to one to see who is in the wrong. I don’t like involving them, but he was not leaving me alone and he could out run me on the scooter thing."
"Job hopped into my current position where I’m getting retrained in a new industry. My partner has 2 jobs , and after a freak car accident , our insurance was able to pay off the rest of our car debt . So we used some of the extra money to get them an electric scooter."
Not a bad idea to do track only riding.
I explain in a lot more detail in the video!
"So yeah, that was kind of a crazy story."
"I currently use a non-electric kick scooter to get to my subway station 1 mile away.  It makes my commute (plus two subway stops from Manhattan to Queens) about 25 minutes, vs 30-35 minutes if I were to to take an additional subway & transfer."
"A bike on the other hand can be ridden for months or years with no falls at all. This doesn’t include mountain biking, which you will eat shit if you MTB. But just riding a road bike your likelihood of falling is small. However, when you do crash on a bike the probability you get severely injured is way higher. Go over the handlebars and you will probably break a collarbone. Get hit by a car and it’s over. Road biking is relatively safe until it’s not and when it goes wrong it goes really wrong."
Configurable 13-20s BMS (really useful for a first time user like me)
"Absolutely... I'm a biker (and still am)... Sounds weird but, you have to have a first accident to ""focus the mind"" - when you're a biker you read the road far ahead.... On a skateboard x that by 5. Ive always maintained that an electric skateboard has brakes which is way safer than hurtling down a hill on a regular board... For example."
"I've personally been commuting solely by EUC and e-scooter for 2 years now and while it is possible it has some major drawbacks. On rainy days I'll get a ride or uber to/from work depending on when it's raining, and during the winter I do the same depending on if the roads are salted and plowed or not. Overall if I only owned one PEV (I just keep buying more) I'll have saved a good amount of money on getting a car, getting insurance, and paying for gas. Even if I owned a car 95% of my journeys would be on EUC so it isn't in the cards for me just yet"
"It should be noted that if you have never skateboarded before, you should know that you wont be traveling around campus effectively for a few weeks if not a few months. Going fast in a straight line is one thing, but being able to control your board through the chaos that are purdue bike lanes, that takes a while to learn. Even if you have skateboarded before, you often need to teach yourself how to do it with a backpack on since the extra weight does take some getting used to. Be prepared to crash a lot, its bound to happen."
From the WP article
"kiwi.com for flights.  seatmaestro or similar to find the most comfortable seat on the plane, and also - redeye flights are your friend, friend.  Look for long layovers someplace.  I have had 12-hour layovers in Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur that basically gave me a free day of touring, while saving money on the whole ticket.  You can stash your bag in the airport."
"If there are pedestrians near your path, slow down always. People can be unpredictable."

"Be conscientious about your own limits, educate yourself about the board’s limits and wear a helmet and pad and you will mitigate the vast majority of risk of accidents and injuries."
"Just today I overhead a tourist telling another his friend got sent home with a head injury after flying into a barrier. With the lack of strict road rules in place, no protective gear and a lot of tourists (many drinking of course) why take the risk?"
So is owning a gun. But you aren’t allowed to use the gun to kill someone else without provocation.
Trend? Skin disease or scooter accident surely..
These electric things that idiots are now riding on the road without them meeting ADR standards. Even bicycles have to meet ADRs so does the safer equipment for your skateboarding/rollerblading hobbies.
I hope this doesn't lead to a crackdown on people who actually follow the laws.
"(as well as additional safety/crash test improvements but volvos are pretty safe as it is, so its not like the current CMA platform is deficient here)"
"The arrest part is obsolete. I stated how I would stay to ensure the safety of the people, which considering your concerns stated throughout about a young child or elderly person being mutilated by this 20kg death trap, should be sufficient."

"A salmon fisherman who abandoned ship by leaping into the frigid waters of the Columbia River last summer -- an instant before another motorboat crashed into his -- has filed a $372,500 lawsuit against the other driver.Clatsop County sheriff’s deputies accused boat driver Marlin Lee Larsen of several crimes after the 75-year-old told investigators he couldn’t see where he was driving because he was sitting down and the dash of his boat was blocking his view. Larsen said he probably should have been standing, according to the sheriff’s report, which notes Larsen uses a motorized scooter to get around on land.Larsen’s son-in-law, who also was on the boat, told investigators that he had warned his father-in-law to pay attention, that he sometimes sees his father-in-law using his cell phone while driving the boat and that his father-in-law had been off-and-on his cell phone the morning of the crash, according to the sheriff’s report.Although Oregon law heavily restricts cell phone use while driving, there are no such specific laws governing boating. But it is against the law to operate a boat without due care.The lawsuit, filed earlier this month, claims Larsen was boating while distracted by his cell phone on the morning of the Aug. 12, 2017, when the crash occurred near the mouth of the Columbia at the Pacific Ocean, just east of Fort Stevens State Park.The suit was filed by Bryan Maess, 47, an off-duty Hermiston police officer fishing with a law-enforcement co-worker, Christopher McMahon, 46. Another friend, Roni Durham, 57, a Clatskanie resident, also was aboard.A GoPro camera mounted to the Weldcraft fishing boat captured the frantic seconds as Larsen’s Bayliner Trophy motorboat speeds directly at them. McMahon can be seen waving his arms and yelling in an attempt to get Larsen to steer clear -- just before the trio jump into the water.The video was shared with The Oregonian/OregonLive by the publication Salmon Trout Steelheader and Angling Oregon, the latter of which is an online fishing website of McMahon's. The video encourages boaters to wear life jackets. Maess and McMahon weren't wearing life jackets. Durham was, but it didn't inflate.Sheriff’s investigators wrote that it was likely Maess and the others would have been seriously injured or killed if they hadn’t jumped into the water.Maess suffered vision problems, headaches and injuries to his ankle, leg and arm from jumping into the water or being struck by debris, according to the suit. Five months after the crash, he wears a knee brace, the suit says.McMahon and Durham also suffered injuries, including cuts or hypothermia. They haven’t filed suit against Larsen but have hired attorneys who say they plan to. Portland attorney Josh Lamborn said his client, Durham, also has suffered psychological trauma and, even though fishing is a big part of her life, hasn’t been able to go back out on a boat since the crash.Larsen, a Roseburg resident, told The Oregonian/OregonLive by phone Friday that he wasn’t using his cellphone while driving his Bayliner and referred to such allegations as “fake news.” Larsen also said a lawsuit seemed unnecessary because the people in the Weldcraft weren’t hurt badly.The criminal case is ongoing. Larsen has pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor crimes of reckless operation of a boat, fourth-degree assault and recklessly endangering the lives of others.The suit was filed in Clatsop County Circuit Court. Portland attorney James McCandlish is representing Maess."
"You don’t need to crash in to anything - just get a little wobble off a bump, take a tumble and smash your head and you’re fucked. That never happens on a bike if you’re competent, whereas most people don’t have that competency on a scooter."
He was on an electric scooter near the Georgia Southern University campus on Saturday morning and was hit by a vehicle that then fled the scene. He was airlifted to the hospital but his injuries were fatal and it was confirmed that evening that he had passed. The police are looking for any tips in relation to the case.
This I think is why motorbikes and bikes get in such bad crashes.
"On June 4, 2021, Banes was struck by a motorized scooter in a hit and run collision on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Prior to the crash, she was crossing the street to get to the Juilliard School. She was admitted to Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital with a traumatic brain injury, and died there on June 14 at the age of 65. The suspect quickly fled the scene and he later drove to an Upper Manhattan shop to get his vehicle fixed."
Still in a state in which it happened he had legal right to carry a loaded automatic rifle into agitated crowd (and people that tried to attack him had a legal right to do that because they reasonably perceived him as a threat and tried to disarm what they believe is an active shooter).
"“Absent a commitment to expeditiously make the dramatic systemic reforms identified by the Monitor and to bring in corrections experts from outside the Department to revamp the agency’s operations and staffing practices, we will be left with no other option but to seek more aggressive relief, which could involve seeking the appointment of a receiver with independent authority to implement sweeping reforms,” the letter said."
"Personally I would not pull the moves you are pulling in the video because I feel like I don't have the reaction time I need.

"The issue really isn't about overpowered ebikes being dangerous to pedestrians or the like, but more because they might be more dangerous to an untrained rider. If you want to ride a motorcycle in the US you have to have it on your license that you have proven you can safely ride a motorcycle. The same doesn't really have to be said right now about ebikes, as they are able to be ridden by anyone, trained in some safety precautions or not. I kinda have to agree with anyone that is trying to at least force some basic safety requirements, as I still think they are necessary."

"People dying because of police, general police brutality and harassment are also a topic here. Most recently, a man named Adil fleeing from an identity check on an electric scooter was pursued by not one, but two police cars. The second one ended up driving towards him at high speed and Adil died in the crash. The crash itself could be ruled an accident, but it's clear that the situation shouldn't even have happened and as usual it reveals a bigger problem. Men of Moroccan origin are disproportionally the victims of police harassment and brutality."

Some knowledge on how to build battery packs
"…After all, it's time for the main course."
"One last thing on skate experience: I think skaters, especially hill-bombing longboarders, often weight the front of the the board for stability. If you have this instinct, you need to get rid of it ASAP on the Onewheel, because it will lead to nosedives (overpowering the motor, tipping forward, feels like the motor abruptly cuts out.) You want to keep your weight over the axle, and only push a bit of shoulders and/or hips forward to tilt the board forward. Some bend in the knees to absorb bumps and to allow body english in case you suddenly find yourself on a balance board."
"One of the things I remember most was this dude we hired. Had a great interview seemed like a really positive guy, level headed."
"If that accident occurs because the board malfunctions or is faulty then it’s on FM, but be sure I’m aware of the potential beforehand and taking appropriate precautions."
it’s come full circle to “not to be made fun of”
He never took that route at night.
It's generally harder to fall off a bike. Most people riding bikes are in more control than most people who ride electric longboards. The types of injuries are different too. I think you're more likely to land on the back of your head coming off a board.
"Last may I was going about 10mph and this young adult on an electric long board was passing me (did not say a word....) and then he fell.... into my line of travel, and he caused me a major crash. We both walked away fine, and we were lucky a witness saw us and that we did not get high by cars."
"Cutting the connection from the main circuit allows me to charge the fender battery separately, in case the batteries become unbalanced (happened to me once on a short run, I forgot to activate the external battery, resulting in draining only the stock battery. In that case each battery has to be topped up separately)"

"The THPS remakes brought me back to a small slice of my childhood. It brought me back to the days of arcade skateboard games. I’ve had such a good time playing them. And now I won’t get anymore because they’re one of 50 call of duty teams. Activision, I gotta tell ya, I just don’t fucking care about call of duty 67. You’re not even trying to come up with new ideas, you’re just rebooting your best series. And I still have more fun playing the MW2 remaster than anything call of duty you’ve put out in years. AND YOU CANT EVEN FUCKING FINISH REMASTERING THAT TRILOGY YOU WORTHLESS FUCKS. Do something right for once."
"transitioning from mounting to forward glide.  This will feel disjointed at first as your brain tries to compensate for this new sensation.  The trick here is getting your body to move as a single unit in tandem with the euc.  When you start, the euc will start to move forward and you’ll most likely jerk backwards."
"I really don’t know. I have thought he was guilty for a long time, but I was on scene recently to a terrible accident involving a head injury. A teen neighbor took a bad fall off an electric skateboard. He was unconscious but his body still kept rising up and trying to get up…it was the craziest thing and I had to keep forcibly holding him to prevent him from smashing his head repeatedly into the road. So when I watched the scene where Kathleen falls in the stairwell, I was instantly taken back to the way his body reacted to the trauma and found it more believable than I did previously that she could have injured herself even more when she was semi-unconscious or unconscious and alone."
And I was never caught even after days or weeks nor billed.
A full face is not overkill because on an electric scooter you are higher off the ground than a bike. You also tend to crash forward due to the smaller wheels and other geometry and more likely to need chin protection. But many choose to take the extra risk and only wear a bike helmet. This is a personal decision but I recommend the full face if you are willing to wear one. Your scooter is right on the line so do whatever is in line with your personal risk level.
I instantly cover my neck and get in the fetal position because I think I'm going to be Rottweiler snacks aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand it turns out to be a tiny dog like this.
"Even a fall just standing is enough to kill you. Doesn't matter how good you think you are you will crash eventually. Not even a question of skill or awareness theres always factors outside of your control that can unexpectedly send you flying. Someone might unexpectedly jump in front of you, a dog might run up to you, a random pebble or crack can give you speed wobbles, a sudden gust of wind can knock you off, you could get hit by a random frisbee, a large bug could suddenly fly into your eye, your board can slip on a surface with a bit of sand on it, etc. Also good luck trying to bail at 20+ mph. You'll be sliding on the concrete before you can even react. Even if you can react there's not much you can do force multiplies exponentially with speed. Whatever little bailing techniques you learned on a skateboard won't exactly transfer over so well at these speeds. From the sounds of it doesn't seem like you've gone on many group rides but I've heard plenty of horror stories from people I've met. I know I guy that even lost his fucking right arm dude. He also shattered his jaw in several spots and broke the tip of his stump in different crashes (jaw was from eskate stump was on a EUC)"
To ride a scooter which is part of an authorised scheme you must have at least a provisional licence. If you plead guilty by sending back the form you'll get a £100 fine and 3 points on your licence.

"When you start to learn, the skills and muscle memory you need to develop are as follows:"
I knew nothing about punk rock but these guys did and they were cool and fun to hang out with. One of them lent me a mix tape because I had to go visit my Dad and had to take a greyhound. I was stuck next to some 260 pound redneck who slept the entire time while I listened to this new music on my shitty walkman.
"I have two different locks. Both flexible. I wrap it around the stem. I couple it with an alarm that scream when it's touched. Also a portable bike pump, it's manual but has a pressure gauge and folds to 8 inches long."
"If you rent a scooter not from Disney, highly consider hotels with a single bus stop as otherwise, someone just riding to the next stop will block you getting on. The best hotel on property for wheelchair users paying cash, in my mind is pop Century. There is literally no carpet anywhere, you have the skyline where you have at most (besides after fireworks) a 5 minute wait for garunteed comfortable transit.  There is a single restaurant. The accessible rooms with the Murphy bed are spacious with multiple turn around points and a built-in bench in the roll in shower. It is my top recommendation unless you are going Deluxe."
The mother of all crash story threads:
"As for your maintenance questions as long as nothing goes wrong (blown motherboard, crash, bent rim etc) you can expect-Tube change every flat (could never happen, I have over 3000 miles and no flats. Never used prevenative measures either and I ride 80% road 20% dirt/gravel-Grip Tape replacement when needed (or just get spiked pedals)-Tire change every ~2-3K miles on average-Batteries will start to show diminishing returns after ~300-500 charge cycles (100%-0%). So if you ride the Sherman hard and average 50 miles on a charge expect the batteries to start to diminish between 15,000-25,000 miles. Most batteries lifespan is officially rated for 1000 charge cycles, but you'd probably want to swap them before then."
I am also not sure where you live but you may be able to charge electric scooters and make a solid amount of cash each night.

Possibly anything to do with the demographic. If you make it illegal for the people that would just commute with it then you are restricting fully owned scooters to people willing to break the law. I'd imagine that a group of society is also more hazardous.

"Hi guys, I'm interested in getting an electric skateboard and can't decide which one to pick. I'm primarily interested in the Mini-type boards that are super small compared to longboards and weigh around 16-18 pounds. I'd like the top speed to be around 25mph (I'm definitely too scared to go any faster on a tiny board). The terrain I'd be going on would mostly be paved roads or sidewalks, there's also I'd say around 20-25% hill elevation where I live. At least a little waterproofing is a must since it does rain quite a lot in Florida and I wouldn't want anything to break after going over a puddle on accident. Also, my price range is around $600. Thanks in advance and hopefully I provided enough information"
"TLDR; in ON vehicle drivers are almost always held at fault in accidents involving pedestrians, regardless of municiple bylaws."
My only tip is don’t go in the Toy Story (DCA) queue with the scooter if you can avoid it.
It sounds like you're not at DC yet. You should explore the area to make sure you're comfortable with the roads you would be riding.
"When learning, have a friend around that you can lean on to hold you up, and make sure you’re on a flat surface. This way you can focus on throttle control basics, foot position, and general balance without having to care too much about the ground throwing you off. Tilted ground and water channels (dry, onewheels are not waterproof (but can be!)) are hella fun to carve around in though, but that’s like step 2."
"Then, I started the Fender design. I went through several iterations. The fender thickness was dependent on how many cells I would place in it and how they were laid out. Working with Sanyo 18650GA cells (4.2V - 3500mAh), I needed 15 cells in Series to match the 63V of the stock battery. Playing with reasonably thick design, I could lay out 3 cells in parallel, resulting in a 15s3p battery pack, 63V - 10.5Ah. The cells are laid out horizontally along the fender curve, with a slight offset to form a WWW pattern."
"Electric unicycles are a good mix between practical and fun, but partly do well because they offer cheap performance."
"The at fault insurer would absolutely pay out. If the electric scooter had been getting used to cross a road, you still can't just hit them because ""it shouldn't legally be there"". If a drunk driver was stopped at a red light, you can't just drive in to the back of them."
"I saw that in a grocery store.  Two teens were riding their skateboards recklessly giving little shoves to carts, endcaps, & people to boost off of or to aid in their turning into the next aisle.  They were just doing it to be jerks because they were riding by people to engage them or their carts. I even told one kid to “be careful.” after I figured out that the first time he pushed off my cart wasn’t an accident. I decided to keep shopping longer hoping that they would eventually get caught by the cops to or get in a fight with an adult, I just wanted to get me a great justice boner.  I saw the store manager just walking not giving a F even though he acknowledged me before I could say something.  He knew, 10 minutes later I hear a loud crash, an old lady screaming and a few seconds later a teen crying like a little baby.  Turns out that that teen was trying to slamon in the wide aisle between the displays in the dairy aisle.  For those of you who don’t know there are sometimes drains in the event that liquids are spilled.  My guess was that he was bobbing and weaving and his skateboard wheel grazed this as he was turning back left to set up his next turn.  His skateboard stayed in place and his face and teeth turned into the tip of a  🖍 . His friend left the store and everybody gathered around just looking.  No customer called 911, (I think we were all fed up with him and wanted him to learn his lesson. He wasn’t going to die, but him almost hitting little kids and the elderly earlier lowered his social score.) the manager had to call once he assessed the situation.  He took a few minutes to get there too.  He didn’t give an F about those kids.  The kid lost most of his front teeth and broke the right side of his face leaving a 8 foot streak of blood in the aisle.  The Fire Department came and I left to go checkout my groceries.  This kid is probably around 20 now, hopefully he learned his lesson."
"As far as I know, the person that bought it didn't take care of it, because he left it out on the rain constantly, and, electronics not getting along with humidity, it ended up frying the battery controller. He had to rebuild the battery and then decided to resell it, like 6 or 8 months after he bought it from me."
"There are dedicated cycle lanes on 90% of all streets in Denmark, and since a car hitting a bike has massive consequences (cars are almost always responsible in the eyes of the law, even if they weren't responsible for the real crash), the cars tend to be much more mindful. I myself am a car drive and e-skater, and I honestly feel safer on my skateboard than my car (apart from the fact that my skateboard has small wheels and wobbles alot lmao), so don't be scared at all to ride your bike, Denmark is probably one of the safest, if not the actual safest country to ride your bike in. Even on roads without dedicated cycle lanes, cars keep a good distance to your left, or stay behind you if they can't get past without getting too close etc. The driver's license training here is intense compared to some other countries like The US... Danes are very good drivers and super mindful of their and your surroundings."
"If you want to look cool, an esk8 or a onewheel ticks the boxes - and you can jump on and off without worrying about taking boots off.  And it's here where you see marketing coming into play.  I did have a onewheel for a year or so, did really like it, but didn't find the time to ride it; I'd prefer to be getting some exercise at the same time.  Some esk8 companies have also crashed and burned from a badly algined marketing strategy."
The speed difference is going to cause a serious injury to one of us at some point.
"Not trying to be discouraging, but skateboarding isnt picked up as easily biking as is so it’ll be a while before you see yourself traveling around campus on one. With that being said, I know a lot of people just order some reasonably priced ones on amazon. And since summer is almost here, you have a few months to practice and get used to it before the fall semester"
"If you're involved in an accident where you bear some or all of the blame, do you really want to spend your life paying, say, for the medical care of someone who was permanently disabled?"
"The next day came a list of 10 new rules that players have to follow, including players having to arrive 90 minutes before all training sessions start (instead of 60 minutes under predecessor Ronald Koeman) and making it compulsory for players to eat together at the training ground (instead of optional). Fines for misbehaviour, which had been phased out since Xavi’s time as a player with previous managers having relied on the player’s own sense of personal responsibility, were reintroduced. As were bans on unauthorised trips for personal business or participation in any sports or activities that involve a risk of injury."

An accident with a car, even going slowly, can paralyze you or worst while the driver will at worst get their car wrecked but they will be fine. So again, I'm not arguing that everybody on non car are particularly pleasant but in term of actual danger I disagree."

Crashes are not only less common on bicycles and scooters but importantly you're a lot less likely to die in a bicycle crash than a car crash. The reason car crashes are bad isn't that two things hit each other. It's that someone got hurt or died.
"foot position matters when learning.

"-  I've been eyeing the Glion Dolly 225.  It is a less stylish and slower than the Unagi, but it is about the same weight.  Both the Glion and Unagi are basically the lightest e-scooters on the market that aren't kids toys (both around 26 lbs).  Its main advantage is that it is built for transit and small apartments/offices.  It can fold up and stand upright by itself, and it has a dolly wheel & handle combination that allows it to be towed (at least on smoother surfaces).  The drawback is that it's not always available (probably due to pandemic supply problems from China), and it has increased in price significantly since I first checked it out ($600 now vs about $450-500 before)."
"- Heavier e-scooters are more powerful and have more range.  This is great for hills and to reach your home, office, and subway station faster.  The downside is that they are heavier, and not all subway stations have elevators or escalators.  So you may need to lug these heavy guys (about 35-45 lbs) up and down stairs each day for your commute."
"When it comes to the rentable ones I think a lot of the riders have only ridden one a few times at most, and almost all the time they've never ridden the specific scooter they're currently riding, which might have differences with brakes / acceleration / etc compared to the other ones in the fleet of whichever company they rent from. I think that's a big part of the problem. I imagine the majority of people who ride them safely either ride them a lot or have some applicable experience riding other things (skateboards, kick scooters, etc) in public spaces."
"-  If you are taking an IRT train, you may want to consider a slimmer lighter scooter vs a bigger heavier scooter or an e-bike.  The subways aren't too crowded now, but who knows what ridership will be like in the future.  Before the pandemic, the Q train in the UES was consistently packed between 8-9 AM, to the point that you often couldn't even squeeze on at 72nd St, which is the third stop from the 96 St terminal.  And the Q train is a wider 10 foot train."
"Why all of your options are sus wheels if you plan to ride on smooth roads? Also, there is way more maintenance on scooters, simply more moving parts, yet the same drawbacks and pros of being electric anyway. Suspension on EUC is really a preference and or enduro offroad feature, not a must like with scooters and bikes. It's also a little better to learn on non-sus wheels, it will develop all the right riding skills. You really need to know how to react to a bump even on sus wheels because if it ever bottoms out you just won't know what to do and crash at high speed."
"Todays Trade Review is a Continuation Pullback on AAPL.  This afternoon AAPL started trending strongly up and as I sat back down at my computer I watched as it broke through the 100 daily ema and daily level with a strong increase in relative volume and then put in clear buy signals on the pull back.  I took profit in portions as price continued to trend up, eventually getting out of the trade as the trend line broke."

"About six years ago I used an electric kick scooter (that I purchased myself) to commute five days each week. It was maybe an hour of riding per day in total. By the end of the year-ish I spent riding it to work, I was very good at riding electric scooters. I could jump it off curbs, weave through obstacles, all of that. My first week of using it, I crashed a couple times just trying to ride it down a bike path (due to turning too sharply, overestimating how fast I could slow down, etc)."

"IMO, if wearing a full suit is a requirement, I don't think commuting by bike/scooter/skateboard is a good idea.

"Around that time I discovered EUCs and was absolutely mesmerized and infatuated with them.  I’m not exaggerating when I say that I spent a whole month watching as many videos about as many models as I could, and every topic…”Tips on how to ride”, “How to ride an euc”, “Crashing on an EUC”, “How to ride seated” and on and on.  There was no question in my mind at the end of that month that it was something I wanted to do and I have not regretted that decision even a little bit."

"In fact, my family has benefited from some of those random group rides to points along different shores and this reservation in that county etc…. So when I say that the “world seems a little bigger now that it’s opened up” is no exageration.

"Yea I don’t have as much experience on scooters, but you have two less wheels to it seems easier to crash. On an electric board the only real way to crash is to hit a something like a rock on the road. And without handle bars you can just run it out most of the time. Of course if you are going over 30mph you are fucked no matter what. I have 1,100 miles on my board and have only crash twice so it is pretty safe as long as you know the roads and aren’t stupid."
I'd also recommend something with a top speed well over what your intended road speeds are. These would require an M-Class license.
"I broke my ankle on 7/3 and had surgery 7/7. For me, the pain was worse for the first week after surgery- worse than the day after the injury. Almost exactly 7 days out from the surgery the pain really changed. It can still be quite painful sometimes, but it hasn’t woken me up at night in the last few days and it’s not as sharp and intense. So, my experience is that the worst phase of the pain lasts for about a week and a half. You won’t feel the level of pain you feel now forever. It still sucks, but I’ve been way less depressed about it since I started feeling less pain. Also, ice helps! I felt at first like it didn’t matter since I don’t feel it super strongly through my splint, but it definitely makes a different in the pain levels."

I'm older and less motivated to compete, and still haven't even seen the doc for a full post-op debrief.

"If you like to cycle around a lot, use a skateboard or a scooter, learn to roll with your landings, for when you crash or find yourself having to stop very abruptly.

"Essentially, the right motorcycle to solve most of the problems with cars is an EV scooter in the 50 or 125/150 cc classes, with removable batteries, in my opinion, but it's not the only solution, and even then, it isn't a solution in some cases."

"If you have a fender, put it on and make sure your socks are kinda thick and cover your ankles. A lot of first timers drop their back foot, leave the front on the sensor and the onewheel scrapes along your ankle as it rides away (and then stops… hopefully). Oh speaking of stopping, the board will slide on its side and can actually travel into parked cars. Definitely had to chase after it once or twice. (not ghosting, literally sliding)."
"As someone who does snowboarding and downhill skating, this is the natural reaction to seeing your buddy crash hard."
I stick to 30km/h for safety reasons. Mostly on bike paths too. So any faster could create very dangerous situations if I run into a situation I didn’t anticipate. And if I fall the damage becomes somewhat limited.
"Now add 11 kg of electric scooter at 20 km/h and it's 1080 J, or 3 times more than running person bumping into someone. It can be lethal to elder people at this point. 40 km/h = 4320 J, or 13 times more. It is potentially lethal for anyone, including the driver."
"“No, it’s not a hoax,” I said, “wait, don’t hang up!”"
You can ignore reaction time because it will apply to both. Or if you want to include add to both. Either way the double electronic brakes on a scooter are much more effective than a road bike. The links match my real world experience and my road bike has disc brakes and wider gravel tires which would make it one of the better stopping bikes in any case.
I would never wear all that junk just to ride my scooter. I would also never own THAT scooter. If I wanted THAT kind of lifestyle I'd just buy a motorcycle.
Electric unicycles can apparently go up curbs through sheer will. The massive pneumatic tire eats literally everything and the extra power makes maxing out much harder (but not impossible). I don't have experience with EUCs but it's not too outlandish to assume that the forward facing stance keeps body straight and the knees in a better position to flex/dampen/absorb bumps and potholes without throwing your sideways balance off as much. Conclusion: EUCs are pretty gnarly but I don't really have much data.
"Edit: While I do skateboard, and my mom did buy my son his first skateboard for Christmas. And we will be spending time now that the weather is nice to learn how to skateboard. I was referring to ice skating. I work away and before this winter I had missed the 10 months of the last year of my four year old sons life while working.  So I built him a rink and enrolled him in skating lessons. And this has been probably the best winter of my life. Watching my son learn a sport and have fun learning despite the crashes and the hard work that goes into learning something new, his resilience and positive attitude, is something I ll cherish for the rest of my life. The first thing he said to me this morning was “Dad, I love skating with you”"
"Point is, she’s reached a pivotal moment, and it’s time to take advantage of it. She hops on a pew—Black Moon primes the ends and the legs—and with a combination of those explosions and the footstep mines across the map, she propels the pew like a skateboard to speed around the church (and get new pews whenever needed). This makes her much faster, since she can afford to propel the pews with far more force than her own body!"
Noone has the right to be an ashole beyond any limit. Thats why i asked for context. What happened before the video started? Did he crash with the skateboard into the group? Did he push his kid ? What happened? I like to know the context before i judge. Obviously not everyone does this.
"It should be about same speed. If the skateboard hits the obstruction, then the skateboard grounds to a halt. Whereas, no force is acted on the person (ignoring kinetic friction with skateboard), so there is no added momentum to make him go faster than original."

It's different, not having an engine is weird but the speakers are pretty great, the sound of the electric motors at full tilt is pretty addictive. I can dust 99.5% of the cars I encounter unless you're that grey GT500 with black stripes, if that guy reads this I'd like a rematch."

"In London, a number of electric rickshaws appeared and there was a couple of crashes, and the news picked up on this hysterically. So they cracked down on their power rating and banning them instead of recognising that they were the solution and might need some sort of smart or contextual electronic speed limit and basic licensing to not be operated dangerously."
But yes your statistics are correct in a way. Also that's why you wear a seatbelt lol. That's the equivalent of wearing a helmet skateboarding my friend.
"I think the main issue with gear isnt that we're not warning people enough. there's plenty of us here telling others to gear up. hell, helmets are rule 1 of the subreddit. the main issue, I think, is that people under-estimate just how dangerous an e-skate crash is. crash on something like a scooter going 50 kmh (31~ mph)? you'll likely be okay. crash on an e-skate at the same speed though? you'll be ejected into the road standing straight up with nothing to save you. people dont seem to understand just how dangerous that is."
"I have a 2014 Honda PCX scooter, it’s dirt cheap and reliable, been riding it for 3 years ever since highschool. On the flip side it’s just not fun riding it anymore, it has low power (obviously), no abs so locking brakes is a thing and after my crash 2 months ago it’s even more noticeable, it’s bruised up completely. The worst thing probably for me are the tiny tiny wheels, front tire is probably as big as was my electric bicycle wheels and it’s annoying in corners and when you got debris on the road which makes it harder to ride. EDIT: to add, suspension is nonexistent now try doing deliveries in this junk for 8 hours without messing your back."

"The government did push for cycling as a more widely used form of transportation all the way back in 2016 or so under the Walk Cycle Ride campaign. The gist of it is to get anywhere with a combination of walking, cycling and taking public transport. The initial plans were to pilot cycling paths in certain zones and increase bike stands in train stations just to name a few. These were good visions of course but the implementation was where it all falls apart. Unlike many places in Europe where roads were transformed into bike lanes, what was done instead was that the bike lanes were squeezed into pedestrian walkways. This severely limits the speed and comfort of both bike lane users and pedestrians. The uptake of electric personal mobility devices as well as bike sharing services also overtook the infrastructure development which never seemed to got out of the pilot phase. Then in 2019, an e-scooter rider crashed into a cyclist, killing her, which sparked an effective ban on e-scooters and many forms of PMDs. All in all, back in 2019, infrastructure design decisions as well as education on safe riding were already way behind the usage of PMDs."

"ICE motorcycles aren't the solution, due to pollution concerns. They really just aren't. The closer you get to 500 cc, the worse your efficiency gets as well - by the time you're to 500 cc, you're worse off than the most efficient ICE cars, because of the incredibly poor aerodynamic performance of most motorcycles, and the engine design/tuning of motorcycles tending to be for low cost and usually high performance for their displacement, at the expense of efficiency and emissions."

And he had that natural ability, the one that has you listening, overwhelming the urge to OH YEAH  crash his 4th wall like the kool-aid man. We ended up going back and forth maybe until last call. It turned out that one of the overt and clear evidence of a godwink/synchronicity  was in the process while we were talking. I won't go into what it was here. I met someone that absolutely would have known his dad, and by all accounts his dad was great. Died too young for my taste for what a good father deserves. Casey is one of the most genuine, grounded, and heart screwed in good and proper. And, he was like me- knew how to tell a story to folks.

"I'm asking because I'm sure helmets can reduce cyclists head injury, but only in some specific cases, like children that fall over, mountain bikes, old people that fall over etc. I myself use an electric skateboard so I always wear a helmet, but it is in case I fall over. The thing in cities is that what is killing cyclists is not ""fall over"" it's a car or a truck or a bus that runs over them, and in that case a helmet is no protection at all, but creates an ""idea"" of protection, thus making accident more frequent I'm almost certain: just see how drivers think helmet are protecting cyclists and get mad about cyclists not wearing them. They just don't understand what a helmet is. Thus not wearing them when they will not protect you is a way to educate drivers."
Apart from the violence….I hate to say it but maybe having to scan a drivers license or permit and it having to match the card somehow? I don’t like having to put more info into companies hands and people not being able to buy their friends the scooter time but I’ve seen enough teenagers being straight up stupid and reckless (also drunk fucks) and me ending up in court/prison/debt/mental torment for hitting one of those snot heads isn’t something I want to deal with.
"“Xavi is very clever, and he knows Barcelona perfectly, what he has to do and say so that the fans are happy,” says one senior socio. “He has to come here and say there are new rules and nobody will get away with anything any more. He knows the fans have the feeling that the team did not work as hard as they should have, which is true.”"
This is the sort of behaviour legislation that purports to be about scooter safety should address. Forget about restricting responsible scooter riders and punishing the whole PEV community with illogical restrictions and focus instead on reducing the number of reckless riders instead that represent way more danger than any responsible rider on an unlimited scooter ever will.
The headline could have been worded better.
"Really makes me wonder why the fuck they even let them do anything before forcing them to make some other bullshit. Like they remade Crash, then remade THPS, and did a fantastic job both times.

"-  Wear protection.  A helmet is the minimum for either, but scooters tend to require more protection.  A faster scooter might require a full-face helmet, gloves, and armor for your body and sensitive joints (wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads).  You may not feel the need to wear good protection, but will wish you did if you ever crash and get thrown off your scooter or bike."
Additionally any motorcycle (gas or electric) is not allowed.
"What if Red turns her gun into a car?: This is tricky. A small gun zooming around and sneaking through the pile-up could easily catch Winona and Ravee by surprise if they aren’t careful, especially with how fast it would be going. However, it’s still limited by a car’s movement, and tight control from Ravee surfing on the hubcap board will let her essentially juke it out if it’s in the open, and stay behind cover if it’s trying to ambush us. Plus, this means Red is without her own gun, so Winona has an opportunity to run up on her and Stock Car Boy without her most reliable ranged option."

"I have reason to use a manual kick scooter for occasional transport.  I chose a scooter over a skateboard for two reasons.  A) Less likely to fall off the scooter.  B) I have more control of the scooter in a crowd.  I can step on and off on a whim.  Don't have to stop and bend over over to pick up the board.  And if I did fall, the scooter won't fly off and hit someone like a skateboard.  I chose a manual kick scooter over electric because A) I don't have to keep it charged and B)  It's easy to carry because it weights only 10 pounds and the handle folds down.  In good weather the scooter is efficient.  I chose an ""adult"" scooter because it has a higher weight limit and larger wheels.  I chose a scooter with hard rubber wheels that I don't need to keep inflated.  (Small tires require air more frequently than say bike tires.)  Down sides include that the front wheel can ""trip"" at a deep side walk crack or on a stick causing the scooter to unexpectedly halt, rain is slick, snow is slick, fall leaves are slick and hide things that will cause the front wheel to trip.  And of coarse, I need pavement.  These factors would be less if I selected a scooter with larger diameter wheels or maybe if I used inflatable wheels.  I've seen videos (in Europe?) where guys were competing in the equivalent of mountain bike races on scooters.  These guys were bush whacking on the run up hills carrying their scooters and then kick scooting through some pretty tough stuff.  They had larger inflatable tires.  So there are off road designs somewhere.  I use the Razor A5 Lux.  There are other adult choices.  But don't go any smaller on the wheels than on the A5 Lux."

"Stock Car Boy punch-rushing either of the two is inadvisable. Winona can use Burn 4 U to set her 3000-degree flames on him, while Ravee can use her stand to throw any punches taken back. Additionally, both Winona and Ravee have easy access to a flame-retardant material with which to deflect the heat created by Stock Car Boy’s arms. Stock Car Boy’s relatively low durability makes a counterpunch a worrying prospect for it, faced with two very skilled counter punchers."
"So I thought I was about to get fucked up, but I wasn't worried because I was on a skateboard that can go 20mph. No prob right? So I ignore it until I hear that chain getting closer and now all I can think about is feeling those sharp teeth sink into my Achilles"
"And yes you get firefighters when you call 911 for a medical.  We are all EMTs and get there faster then the ambulance most of the time. Often lifting a large patient is more then 2 paramedics can do.  Also we can assist with medical care.  CPR works much better with 3 or 4 people. The paramedics can concentrate on giving meds, the egg etc if we are bagging, doing compressions and monitoring the and."
"It doesn't help this reminded me of my first crash which was a hit and run. Unlike in the video where this guy could see the car for more than one second, I got hit on my side off a crosswalk sent flying into another street. Car driver had a stop sign but you all know how we tend to roll into our stops. If only he wasn't going like 30 mph. Only had a helmet at the time and yea, no matter what, you're not getting up from that impact. It's also very difficult to think rationally if you're still coincidence."

"Punk houses were cool. They were very communal. As long as you covered your share of the rent, everything was fine. Rent was usually dirt cheap though because these houses were borderline condemned.

"Additionally, performance matters a lot. (I'll use cc here to describe classes of motorcycle, even when referring to electric.) A 50 or a 125/150 cc motorcycle is a completely different beast from a 250/280/300 or even a 500 (unless it's something low-revving like a Royal Enfield, where their 500 performs like a 250). 50 cc stuff may even struggle to keep up with cars on current American surface streets, 125/150 cc stuff often can't go much faster than that. Therefore, both of those classes can reduce urban sprawl compared to a car just through being slower. (However, the 125/150 cc class can absolutely do a lot of damage in a crash if ridden irresponsibly, significantly more than bicycles.) The faster stuff, though, once you're freeway-capable..."
"Cars trying to block me? Instantly reroute around them, giving plenty of berth. Unseen puller-outers to the right? I spot them and can stop or reroute long before danger strikes. People opening doors? Even if timed perfectly, the impact would be laughable and would leave no damage or injury."
If this kind of stuff continues along with the recent escooter crash death it won't be unimaginable that they'll be banned the same way NSW has gone.
well they’re meant for people who can’t move around due to injury or disability. In america it’s a bunch of obese people using them.

"An electric bicycle maybe should be allowed and electric stand up scooter maybe  should be allowed, but they should not exceed the speed that can be achieved on a normal conventional bicycle. We shouldn’t be whizzing close by people at high speeds on the narrow bridge path, shouldn’t be being a nuisance on our electric stuff. For a couple reasons. 1 if you’re going crazy fast on a regular bike ok you’re a daredevil and you have some physical mastery over your body and the bike maybe you deserve it. If you go crazy fast on a electric vehicle next to human powered bicycles, you’re just a dick. Let them enjoy their narrow bridge experience then when we all get off the bridge you can resume going higher speed. Also remember the electric vehicles generally are less nimble, so passing a bicycle is sort of like driving a truck on the wrong side of the road to pass a sedan or something it’s dangerous. Whereas a conventional bike usually can be more agile. Also our machines are heavier. So if a crash does happen, there’s a higher chance of serious injury and remember the people you’re squeezing passed are innocent people they never asked for you to try this stunt. So it’s selfish of us to try to pass too, our machine is heavy and can hurt someone, more than a regular bike, so we better not crash it on some guy esp not some guy on a regular bike."
"There are 2 specific things in my life that i can contribute to my injury. But it's hard to actually pinpoint what exactly did it. I used to skate, and for about 15 years i always had a skateboard in my trunk. So i got used to taking some pretty heavy spills. I also lifted weights in highschool and in college, and had aches and pains over the years from it. But no serious injuries or surgeries. Then about 7 or 8 years ago i was involved in a pretty gnarly car accident. I got rear-ended by a drunk driver, while driving a little S10 Chevy truck. I was a sitting duck, nothing i could do but watch it happen. Stopped at a red light with a few vehicles in front of me, and i just happened to glance at my rear view mirror and noticed a car behind me with his signal on, like he was merging into a different lane to go around. Only thing is, the guy was going too fast and didn't turn his car quick enough. It was determined, after the fact, he was traveling about 55 mph at impact."
"Well no. The entirety of his trial that I watched from beginning to end (you can too if you want to avoid saying ignorant shit about it on the internet) convinced me and the jury that he wasn’t guilty of the crimes he was accused of. There’s a legal term called “acquittal” that’s pretty important here. Not a technicality, not a mistrial. “Not guilty” on all counts in a court of law where both sides had the opportunity to present evidence and examine all relevant witnesses."

"One night I was skateboarding home from the home of one such girl I had just finished sleeping with, randomly ran across a few girls I knew who were having a party to celebrate one of their friends from out of town about to get married.

"It might work with motos/scooters. People won't get exercise, and there will still be noise/air pollution (unless they use electric bikes) but the space per person will decrease and the number of people who pass any given point will increase, leading to a higher number of people getting places faster. Also, it will make drivers and moto riders more attentive since it would be too easy to crash if you don't pay attention."

"The second is educational philosophy. German children are taught from an early age to be self-reliant and responsible (age-appropriately, of course). The older they get the more responsibility and leeway they get - and the trust from their parents that they've taught their children well enough that they can sort out issues which arise without parental involvement. So a child in early primary school may well decide to head out onto the street or a neaby park to play with friends, shout this up to their parents upstairs, and then be out of the door. The parents don't worry - Germany is so much safer than the US that the risk to the child is minimal, and being self-reliant is important for their development. There are always adults somewhere who will occasionally (metaphorically) raise their head and check if everything seems OK with the children playing nearby, but it doesn't necessarily have to be the parents, and most of the time the children are left to their own devices."
"You know what happens in my country if you hit someone with a modified or illegal e-bike? You get charged as if it were any other un-registered road vehicle you hit them with. You could have been going 10km an hour when you hit them, but if it’s proven that your bike or scooter goes faster than the legal 25kmh under-power, you’re up the creek. In 2015 Albert Dean May was leaving a shopfront and was struck by an illegal e-bike going under 25km. He later died from his injury and the rider was appropriately jailed, his crime, not following simple laws. Now that’s real life."
"Anyway, I guess the point is that medical costs for crashes like these are not covered by TAC, so if you decide to access services as a private patient you have to pay whatever isn’t covered by your private health insurance. Or you could just access free public services."
Onewheel spills are generally the most violent since they result in you being thrown towards the ground like a falling domino. Look at all the broken collarbones and scraped palms. What doesn't help is people getting big heads in the first 200 miles or less and nosediving. Conclusion: The most violent and probably most common due to the nature of a self-balancing vehicle of this form factor.
"Unsure about Scooter Barrett at 6 - we've all seen what happens when we target a lineout over having dedicated blindsides. Happy to be proven wrong, would've liked to see Ioane or a more proven Vaa'i at 6."
Politicans are vocal about a green future but at the same time stuck in this kind of car-brain mindset of disliking certain modes of transport.
"But I was stupid. Yes, if you are running a marathon every day, you really are putting yourself at risk for injury.  But you don't have to train that hard just to be in good shape. Eventually I realized this and started a daily walking habit. It has been 15 years and I yet to injure myself (I did break my wrist last year, but that was from riding an electric scooter, not from exercising)."
"Nerve pain is a b!tch, but you can push through it and with time it gets better for most. First 3 years mine was 8/10 and no medications were helping and I did my best to stop taking any pills post rehab. I still have numbness in my feet and feel general discomfort but I've accepted that this is the new normal now. First 6 months I couldn't brush my teeth or feed myself. For 2 years my mom had to move in with me because my strength didn't come back to me as quickly as it usually happens for other people. Within first 10 days of my injury I've lost 40 pounds of muscle weight, I was so pissed, I used to work out at least 3 times a week for years and it was all gone within 10 days!"

"Hill decent is amazing with the electric brake.  Again, going downhill on the L9 on these steep routes were a no-go.  Its speed would quickly blow past the stopping ability of the rear-only brake, almost ensuring a crash.  Some places I could creep down on the brake at walking speed but often I had to dismount for safety.  Only medium hills were within the electric hill-decent envelope, but when you pull the brake lever, this regen turned off leaving you way past the point where the rear tire would lock up and fail to slow the scooter.  Other times I overheated the motor going downhill causing the same situation.  My brakes needed continuous replacement, maybe 6+ sets of pads in the past year.  The Apollo is perfectly controlled, I can even let my speed increase above 20mph on a steep hill, then reign it right in with the electric brake."
The investigation has been unable to substantiate the claim that the chancellor was driving the car that collided with the student skateboarder.
"By day 7, the skateboard has made it halfway to B. The car is still having the seats made, the engine checked, wheels added, body painted."
"Also, please don't ride that thing drunk or stoned. We've had several posters recently who had thought this was an extremely clever thing to do (one hadn't even been here a week)."
Could argue that the riders insurance is void but liability for the scooter and the scooters owner still stands.  The scooter is a commercial entity and must pay some form of compensation to government for use of public infrastructure like roads and footpaths. And it is a form of transport so maybe TAC claim be explored.?Either way these companies need to be held accountable for any injury and damage the scooter causes regardless.
"I relate to this so much. Together 8 years. I feel the same way, down to the not liking it and being hard to explain why. He’s just different and not the person I know. He gets really affectionate when drunk and i hate it, which to him comes across as me not being grateful of his affection. I am so turned off and i don’t want to give him affection when he’s like this. It just makes him act more affectionate and try to initiate more. I have a hard boundary of no sex while he’s drunk. He thinks he doesn’t have a problem because he’s not violent etc. However, he has done things like fall off a golf cart and ruin an expensive suit, ride and crash an electric scooter injuring his shoulder, and climb a stripper pole and land face first when letting go while upside down. He also doesn’t want me to tell him what to do. I went off on a tangent there but the fact that you are still dealing with this at 23 years makes me sad, i keep hoping he will realize it’s a problem and stop 😭 we’re trying couples counseling…"
PSA to everyone out there. Do not take your health and body for granted. A random act from someone could change it all in an instant no matter how careful you are! Stay safe and please pay attention while driving. No one wants to be on either side of an accident like this.
"James: No, it's my helmet. And if you don't buy it, then aren't you also saying that person's life is worth less to you than fifty bucks?"
The man smiled and introduced himself as Gino before escorting me through the small door at the back of the office and into the warehouse proper.

Laughing until you cry.
"First All Black test of the year. Fucking better than Christmas. Time to send it. I love when we play the Irish, always guaranteed to be a comically physical test with passion. Some of my takes from this squad."
"Electric scooters outside of recognised schemes (scooters owned by companies) are not allowed on the road, I assume from what has been said it is he own privately owned scooter, therefore he was likely breaking a number of laws before you had your accident. In this instance you would not be liable for anything you have no obligation to be paying for an illegal scooter that should not be on the road."
"If you live in or near a larger city there's a chance there's a group already. Try searching on Facebook something like ""NYC PEV"" and replace PEV with electric scooter, EUC, ESK8, Onewheel, Float Life. Until you hopefully get a hit. My local riding group is labeled as ESK8 even though 80% of the active riders ride EUC, and unless they're complete stick up the ass people they won't mind a scooter rider joining a group dedicated around another PEV. Group rides in the prime riding season are great, and being able to get out without fear of slipping on ice (had my first unicycle crash a few weeks ago after 2500+ miles due to icey back roads). I was still only riding my unreliable slower scooter until August so I only got in at the tail end of the riding season with my faster PEV's. I'm already planning a few cross state, and even potentially a cross country ride for this summer"
"Oh my! I am sorry that happened to you. I was chased by a dog once and he legit tried to attack me, I was on my electric scooter and he saw me and ran after me growling and snarling and barking. My scooter goes pretty fast and he was able to keep up and was right at my ankle. I was so scared I was going to crash and that he would attack me. I had to keep looking down to see if he was losing steam, thankfully after chasing me a good 2-3 minutes he gave up and I was able to get away safely."
"I'm now waiting for an eloflex electric wheelchair that I can bring in my car and use while shopping or bring on vacations. I can still feel a bit selfconcious about it, but I'm working on it. I also have a great SO who encourages me to use it. Like my mum said; some need glasses to see, some need a wheelchair to get around. Glasses are normalized, but so should a wheelchair."
Am i wrong though? It's not trustworthy if it can't provide the right information
"The only police brutality case in the last year was a scooter getting nudged during a high speed chase with it, leaving the riders with no notable injury."
"Others in my area were frequently hit, some killed, it was scarily common. I believe their thought process is they want hurt you bad enough you will never want to ride a bicycle/scooter/skateboard again and get a car instead, if not your death is an entirely acceptable option. The logic being 'If you had a car you wouldn't have gotten hit, or rather I wouldn't have had to run you over, so it's your own fault.' Unless a street is completely devoid of cars I'll gladly take the sidewalk, even with all the cracks that have caused me a few spills. I never hit or was a danger to anyone."
"However, providing them as city’s premier micro mobility option seems to be a bit wrong IMO."
"On the day of the fatal attack, the dog was unrestrained when Jack walked in to play with a friend."
Fucking propaganda corrupted all of you who believe his bs
"She and I were Diabetics. We would sneak off to go shopping and actually go eat pretzels at the mall. So bad, but it was fun! She would crash her electric scooter into the shelves at stores. We always went shopping for Christmas decorations together. She would go to baseball games and have so much fun!And she loved her Grandson so much!"
"Xavi’s first public statements as Barcelona coach were a surprise for some who thought they knew him as a playmaker-philosopher mostly interested in complicated team tactics and perfect pitch surfaces. At his presentation he sounded a lot like an old-school British manager complaining that standards around the team had slipped since his days as a player, but making clear that nothing but maximum commitment and discipline would now be allowed."
"Slept great, woke up and thought it was all a dream until I got a text from my coworker lmfao"
"Yet, if your attitude is the attitude of those who want to play with our toys and fuck with our hobby, then I suppose maybe we'll end up deserving it as a whole."
"Similarly, if your problem is that commuting in cars is a debt trap for people with lower incomes, motorcycles can be much cheaper to manufacture, and are a win. (And, because light weight isn't as much of a concern, motorcycles can actually beat the higher-quality electric bicycles in cost.)"
not proper driving but on my electric scooter i often crash into bins because i’m speeding too much and i sometimes get beeped at by angry cars because i don’t check the left and right cars turning in somewhere. i went on holiday to new york and went on electric bike and i nearly died like 20 times
The other day I saw a lurid headline about an e-scooter that had run over someones dog and killed it. Obviously cars kill many more animals every year.
"It cost me about $4500 between the (broken and crash damaged) bike, the gear to ride more safely, and the parts to fix said broken bike, but I'm saving $200+ a week in gas and parking, so it does add up.  I'll break even by the end of summer, just in time to need to buy warmer winter gear.  That said, if I ride through winter, I'll save a few thousand dollars I would have spent on gas and parking, so the gear will pay for itself as well, and I actually enjoy my commute now.  It's just more fun on two wheels."
"Dude asked if I was okay, I said ""Yeah sure haha"" to not let him on to my internal bleeding."
"If you're not consistently commuting with it, I think you'll be okay. But anytime you're on the road, you gotta drive defensively. Doesnt matter if you're on a bike, or skateboard, or car. Tgeres more risk on things like a bike for injury during a crash. The roads are a battlefield."
"I think one thing we could do to help those understand urban mobility is that increased car traffic means nothing. Yes cars get stuck, a blocked traffic light will cause lots of problems and a crash can block lots of cars for a while. But, all the forms of transportation we advocate for are not affected by cars or traffic jams."
That could explain things.
Beastie Boys were super influential. Their first album was ok. It was kind of a joke album but they put out Paul's Boutique in 88 which was amazing.
"It does not matter the number of cars that travel through an intersection or the average speed of a car from point A to point B. The metric that matters is how many people get through the intersection or how fast a person can get from point A to point B. Bikes, scooters, skateboards or just walking can move huge numbers of people through an intersection with zero risk. Buses and trains can get soo many people from point A to point B really fast. We don't care about your car problems, they are only problems with cars."
"I'm currently using a Uscooters Booster GT SE. It's bloody expenny at $950, but it's worth it for me because it's a 30 lb scooter that hauls ass up SF hills, and it's tiny."
Same speed limit applies for all on of those vehicles on a footpath. Dude was going way faster than 10Km/h and should be dealt some form of punishment.
"You might say, “I’ve seen a vehicle-to-vehicle collision on a 30mph road and it didn’t look too bad”, but what you’re seeing is a collision where the driver braked first so the actual speed at the time of collision might have only been 15-20mph. If there’s no braking before impact, things are bad - like if the driver was drunk/distracted, or didn’t see a passenger/scooter emerging from behind an object etc."
“You okay back there?” The taxi driver asked. I sighed and was about to attempt an explanation when my phone buzzed again.
"The physics of the scooter fall are very, very different than on a bike. On a scooter, you fall towards the front most of the time (unless you are being hit by a vehicle); thus, if you value your upper extremities, face, and knees, you need the appropriate equipment. I had a friend that fell in an Unagi at 15mph and had broken teeth and serious surgery to his chin."
"I’m disabled and use a powerchair (earlier on used a manual chair/crutches) and it struck me immediately that aspects of nannying and pet care (specifically walking dogs) are difficult to do if you have injuries to your feet. If I were looking for a place to live or employment, I would always say what access requirements I need and also key things I don’t need (e.g. wheelchair access required but not a hoist - as otherwise people may assume you need more than you actually do)."

"“What he was doing in Qatar was to prepare for Barcelona,” says the source who knows Xavi. “Experimenting, looking at different ways of doing things, what role would each staff member have. They had their objectives at Al-Sadd, but the final objective was to be ready to come back to Barca.”"
"I think TSLA will shit the bed and AAPL will be neutral, reversing the MSFT gains. Unless the FED announcement today is great"
When you have the infrastructure it just makes sense. I get to work as fast as if I was on my motorbike. I pollute less and it gives a bit of excercise.
Anything else you question.
"At the brass tax, the conventional regulatory apparatuses don't work for these new categories and have to be reformed, this is inescapable.1 But the cynical people like at Bird or Uber exploit this dynamic in bad faith."
"Ted: When you rode it did you straddle it like a horse, or were your legs pointed forward like a fairytale princess in a ball-gown?"
All I need on a daily are listed below.
I have an electric scooter that can top out at about 20mph. I wiped out at 10 and had a limp for a week. I can't imagine how much it would hurt to crash one of these super fast scooters.
"James: Whoa Ted, check it out! Some dingus wants to buy this helmet for fifty bucks!"
My sisters dog did this to some random kids on a scooter the other day and the kid fell off his bike and hurt himself. I gave her an earful. And I kind of wish they would have it happen to them and get a small injury just to see how dumb it is.
The city’s jail boss revved up the feds’ frustration with conditions at Rikers Island by missing a meeting with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office and going to a car show.
"“Look, I promise I won’t use it for anything sinister,” I said and smiled at the AT&T lady."
"My biggest advice to you is to get a knee scooter! So much easier to use than crutches. I was in tears every time I had to get to the bathroom on crutches, just because it’s so slow and annoying. Plus with a knee scooter you don’t need to hold something in your hands to stand up, so you can do a little more around the house.I rented one from a pharmacy, but  I realized a lot of people buy them when they have an injury and then try to get rid of them. A neighbor saw me with mine and offered me hers for when my rental expires. If there’s a buy nothing group in your area you might be able to find one free. I got a bag for mine that fits on the handlebars (like a bike bag) so I can carry stuff around from room to room."
Ah man you did nothing wrong. You sound like a badass manager/trainer to have.
"I’m 36, 6’1”, 260, ok shape. Had one standstill spill in the first week and landed on my back. I’ve dislocated both my shoulders 4 times (previous stuff), and tweaked my right one a little on that fall. I’d say it took maybe a week for it to feel normal again and my back maybe two weeks for it to completely stop hurting when sitting down, but I continued riding this whole time. Years ago I used to wakeboard and skateboard, but was always way more careful on a skateboard because they can get out from under you so easily and you’re always on a hard surface. The Onewheel isn’t like that. It’ll balance under you and hold you up with regards to front & back, but side to side is moreso directly up to you so you’ll need to develop good foot and calf muscles (worry not, riding will do this for you), keep your legs always bent a little to act as springs and develop skills slowly. Always be aware of what you’re about to roll over. Even small things can affect the tilt of your board and it’s better if you can anticipate them (when learning. When off road, it’ll bounce around a bit. Many people lower their tire’s air pressure.) Do not ride through foot fatigue until you get accustomed to moving your feet around on the pads to relieve it, get off and walk around a little. Fatigued feet basically stop working and you’re asking for a crash. Also, onewheels can go off road, so if you wanna learn something that you’ll fear you may fall on, try to learn it in a way where you fall into some grass. BTW, bumpy grass will also slow you down and make the motor work harder, and it’s a much more intense time for your muscles, so if you end up falling a lot on grass compared to harder surfaces, that’s not too uncommon until you get used to riding on it. Packed dirt is the best off road surface for riding."
Definitely worth the post mate looks like the helmet saved you allot of damage I wear full motorcycle gear man i had a crash and came out fine Even if you only got a slow scooter get some form of protection
Thank you for the video. Here's some uncalled for musings about the subject:
The best designed game is the one that you can release at any point during development where it will still be a game and not an art project.
"This! Helmets are single use after a crash. Crack could be hairline. Learned this from skateboarding days. Op if you need a new full face I just got a 100% status from planetcyclery.com on sale for $60 c: there are quite a few around $75, I too am a fan of full face helmets. What I don't want are dental injuries, they are some of my least fave."
"Since leaving radio he was working, proudly, at Costco."
"Correction Commissioner Louis Molina Correction Commissioner Louis Molina (Barry Williams/for New York Daily News) Both Williams’ office and the federal monitor Steve Martin have been pushing the Department of Correction to hire outside experts to help run the agency, but Molina has instead hired several top officials from other city agencies with no correction expertise."
"However, if I were in her position advertising, I’d want to be a lot clearer about this. I get not wanting to say too much about your disability in advance thinking it may put people off, but the way this is written with the injury prominently mentioned at the start, I think lots of people reading it would also be put off as they may assume the level of impairment to be worse than in reality - thinking that if e.g. you could manage stairs, you’d probably say that, so not saying it means you probably can’t."
The auto show started on Friday and goes through April 24.
"So although I do think riders who put others at risk using public roads as racetracks or stunt sets are idiots, I don't judge ""squids"", nor the guy with full leathers on a 50cc scooter, nor the crazy stunt dudes who try that in safe, closed areas."
"The admittedly pretty rough statistics for injury/fatality can be halved by wearing a helmet, halved once more by riding sober, again by being under 60 and then reduced even more by wearing armour and riding defensively."
The autoscrubber.
"I've always worn a helmet, a habit from cycling. I've only ever hit my head once, in my years on a bike or scooter or skateboard, when I had to bail out on an incline I wasn't ready to take on my board. No injury, and I walked it off just fine, but that was enough to remind of just why I wear it. Don't let anyone tell you that helmets aren't cool. Ending up in the hospital with a head injury is way less cool."
"Same thing my dad does whenever we go skating, he doesn't bring his board bc he feels like having an electric scooter pull him along is easier post car accident, yet every time I mess up a trick, he grabs my board and gets on, fucks up or completely nails the trick, and says ""like that"""
"Bands like DOA, SNFU, 7 Seconds, Youth Brigade and more and I listened to that tape for a week straight. When I got back, I begged my mom for a better skateboard and was hooked."
"I don't believe anyone doubts protective gear works; between riding completely naked and with MotoGP rated leathers, airbags, helmet, boots and gloves, there will obviously be a progressive injury severity result, all other things being equal in an accident."
Accidents are a leading cause of death of all ages
"honestly I think this subreddit gets a little overwhelming at times with the whole protection thing. take for example Druski's latest post here of him doing a top speed test and his buddy falling. there was over 200 comments of people criticizing his stance and gear. like, damn, we get it, they fucked up. but 200+ comments? its a little much imo. say it once or twice, its fine. but at some point it gets a little annoying. Druski isnt new to e-skate either, he knew very well the risks he was taking. we dont need to send him and his friend 200+ comments explaining said risks."
"So sad. Everyone please be careful on the Lime scooters, and drivers be alert! If you have any information about the accident contact the Georgia State Patrol."

I currently use the Herschel Little America 25L and I have a couple of gripes.
"- E-bikes aren't as great for getting into and out of subway stations.  They are bigger than e-scooters, meaning they are more awkward to carry around.  They are heavier than normal bicycles because of the motor & battery.  I used to bike to the subway on my way home, and it was a nice exercise to get there, then to lift the bicycle over my shoulder to carry up/down stairs and over the turnstile (it's more acceptable to use the doors now).  But this was a non electric bike.  It's probably more of a chore to lug a heavier electric bike down the stairs."
Warning - they are not cheap lol
"“There was a relaxation of the standards,” says a source close to various Barca players. “The minimum at all clubs is an internal disciplinary code which the players know and respect. That is essential, and Xavi has to mark out that line. Talent on its own is not enough, and even less in today’s football; the day-to-day work is key.”"
My question is how do you folk feel about golf carts? We have a lot of them here too. Personally I like them
"I've given them a bunch of free fixes (such as the independent chargers creating ""bird nests"" on private property, essentially leasing space and doing a revshare or a partnership with local businesses through swiftmile (which already has the freaking docking station ready to go) similar to the volta model with whole foods). They could fix their legal problems at like zero cost but the idea of it taking non-zero effort makes them not care because all they see are the arbitrage opportunities. it's pretty gross. They take great solutions and recklessly transform them into new problems."

"and a one-block-long car-free multi-use space for play, student drop-off and pick-up, and outdoor learning outside each of New York City’s 1,700 public schools;"
NO DRUGS.  NO. Just...don't. Risk not worth the benefits.
I shoved the envelope into my jacket and hurried out the door. Once I got onto the sidewalk I went to pull out the envelope when my phone buzzed.
"Most of the gear for me is helmet, earplugs, gloves, armored jacket or “overshirt”. Sometimes armored pants. Very rarely CE rated footwear. If I lose a foot, well that’s the way the cookies crumbles."
"I crashed at 35MPH wearing full moto gear except riding pants on an electric unicycle. I was alright but banged up and ripped my jeans. Couldn't imagine doing this at 75MPH on a god damn scooter with only a helmet and skateboard pads, you'd fucking die. You need armored gloves, jacket with pad inserts, sturdy boot with ankle protection, and probably kevlar pants. I hope the helmet is Snell rated."
"Now, they became more popular in my country, and, as far as I know they are still going strong, so I believe with proper care they should last for a while."
"The next thing I did was go into the bathroom that was inside my room, and it had a shower.. and I always finished showering cold on a daily basis, but just felt like shit due to the accident and injections and shitty food they gave me."
🤨“SPOILER ALERT: The President will address the nation from the capital city to announce a state of emergency in four hours”
...do they tho?  Because the cities data seems to indicate that of the 58 people killed and 181 serious injured last year... 100% involved cars or motorcycles.
"""You the guy?"" a thick-necked man in a blue jumpsuit asked. He stood behind a counter that looked like it served fast food."
"It didnt seem sketchy, if anything it felt like a safer version of long boarding because it had brakes & went 20mph max."
"Also, think of it like this, if you really dislike them so much, then try voting for more bike lanes and better public transportation, you will absolutely see less bikes, or even electric kick scooters (I have a segway ninebot max G30P, goes 18 MPH and I just plug it in my wall, and can throw it in my shopping cart at the grocery store with how small it is), on normal or main roads if there are more bike lane options, or even entire roads only for bikes/electric bicycles/electric kick scooters."
The investigation is being handled by the CHP (not UCSB PD) to prevent risk of bias.
The stars.
Also worth noting - the CMs are great at accommodating this. My mom hurt her foot while we were there and had to rent a scooter for her with zero research done ahead of time.
your advantages on any 2 wheeled vehicle are
"there could be other factors though. diet/nutrition. (as well as diet timing. do you always get some carbs as part of a pre-workout to fuel these exercises?) vitamins, sleep, stress, other exertion throughout the day. another factor could be rest days. if you work a muscle group, it may need a day to rest and repair. if you are trying the feat everyday, that could possibly explain some inconsistancy."
"The thing I am trying to figure out is if this Aer bag fits with what I need. Also, I am wondering if this bag would be available for purchase in person where I am as I am located in Canada and Canada has god-awful import tax rules that do me over every time. If I order this bag on their site it will be no exception. Aer's website claims that Nordstrom carries the bag but neither have I ever seen it in person nor seen it on their Canadian site. It is on the US Nordstrom site tho."
"Obviously I can’t speak for everyone, but I’m certainly not going to hold anything against an at the time 19 year old for fucking about a bit. His performances dipped when he signed a new contract which was a bit annoying but could have just been coincidence."
"It's the rental scooters that are the problem. Most private scooter owners know how to ride one and don't particularly want to crash as they don't want to get injured and fix/replace their scooter. I say most as like any form of transport, there are always a few morons ruining it for everyone."
"Three weeks back at Barcelona, after six years away in Qatar, Xavi has already begun to set in place the deep structural changes he has long planned to make on and off the pitch at the Nou Camp."
"I can't believe how desensitized we all are, particularly Americans, to auto related violence: I actually read this post and laughed sadly to myself for a second thinking of how many dozens of times I'd very nearly been hit on foot, on a bike or on one of my scooters (I'm in the NYC area) and then it dawned on me like oh... I HAVE been hit by a car twice but not catastrophically enough to immediately stand out in my mind."
But that’s not directly causing it?
"I looked around and saw the taxi driver getting out of his busted cab. I screamed and he looked over, “Hey, it’s Sam right? You okay?”"
"If your front tire gets stuck hitting something it can't roll over (curb or giant pothole or other), all your momentum can go into rotating around that point of contact and you faceplant."
"Definitely, I deliberated about getting a scooter or electric wheelchair for years. I got a push wheelchair two years into my condition and while at first it was useful in getting me out and about, I found not being in control of movements made my fatigue worse. What stopped me from getting more equipment was cost, I knew it'd be useful for me, but it's expensive and I sat on the fence for a year and a half longer until I finally decided to not only get a scooter, but to apply for disability to pay for that and any other equipment I needed."
A Power Brick
"I did a pistol squats every day. I didnt do a lot of them, just like 5 on each leg. But i was consistent. Every day, as best as i could manage. They also force you to use a lot of stabilization muscles."
The bag is top accessed which means if I need anything I would have to take out everything from the top in order to access anything in the bottom.
"Bro are you taking your anger out on me or something? Just say not feasible and move on. Obviously there isnt an electric scooter repair place in NYC, however there may be a possibility of a place that fixes vehicles knowing how to work around my issue."
"Electric Scooters are less safe. rarely anyone ever wears a helmet, so you'll probably eat shit, especially on the roads of Berkeley. That said, don't even think about an electric skateboard, cus you'll DEFINITELY eat shit. So make sure you use bike lanes as much as possible, get a bell, and proper light."
Out of date vehicle standards. Technology exists which can alert drivers of high vehicles when an unexpected object enters the truck drivers blind spots; yet such technology isn't compulsory in most developed countries. Why the fuck not?
"While deaths are low, my understanding is that there are many hospitalizations per trip, which is something we as a society should be taking into account. I’d be really interested in seeing electric biking vs electric scooter injuries per mile."
"Electric Bike or Electric Skateboard, had a OneWheel XR that I loved to death with 1000miles but got a seriously bad injury when It flew me off like Superman and it made me rethink about using one and I sold it, and I’ve definitely had other falls on it before, not safe if you’re trying to go even 19mph it you’ll just be cruising at 15-16 mph to be safe, which is boring lol"
An unexpected snow day.
"The dog was owned by Brandon Hayden, 19, and was in the charge of Amy Salter, 29, whose house the dog was staying at. The pair pleaded guilty to being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control, causing injury resulting in Jack's death. Around 30 members of Jack's family sat in the public gallery to hear the sentencing."
Couple of Pens
"This model is meant to be attached on the existing holes of the board, 4 holes where the original fender is screwed on, plus 4 holes where the pads are screwed on. The fender only goes over the pads by 1 cm, not taking too much space for your feet."
"I live in a ""retirement community"" and a lot of people here drive golf carts which serve a similar purpose as your mini cars (and also use bike lanes)... but I could not step up into one or use it because of my need for hand controls to drive."
"Emmanuel Goldstein (nice reference by the writers, btw) had become a big time Chief Security Officer at XYZ corp. They've recently been getting cyber attacks and something feels familiar about it... turns out it was CRASH OVERRIDE, the black hat who went deep underground sometime around 2000."
the longboard. Don't know. didn't read because I don't care about this guy's skateboard injury braggadocio.
"Again, the cliche might be that traditional fans and pundits would have also wanted to hear Xavi talk about Johan Cruyff’s legacy and the difference between a No 6 and a No 8 in his favoured 4-3-3 system. But his call for more discipline around the squad was widely welcomed by socios who shared this idea that the players needed a stern talking to."
"There are ""No basketball"" clauses in many players contracts, where they can lose guaranteed money if they miss team events or games due to a non-football injury."

"Stupid road design.  1. Footpaths/sidewalks abutting roadways leave zero room for error in case a driver fucks up, or a pedestrian fucks up."
Thrashin movie from 1986 is a good example. You can see a punk influence and alternative subcultures:
I was sitting at a red light Friday on my way home from work (by bike) and a guy on a scooter almost got hit by a car crossing on a no-walk. Thought I was going to end up with a severe injury / death on my GoPro
"Being a car guy is awesome, being a car guy with an electric car hasn't been as much fun but it's getting better. There's more and more people each weekend more curious than hostile. More questions than sneers. I get it's not your thing and that's okay. I'd encourage you to go to your nearest supercharger sometime or ask around in your Facebook car group, you might encounter an owner who's a weiner but most are like me I love giving people rides and changing opinions."

"Glad you're ok OP. It absolutely sucks how much damage you took, but still, it could've been much worse. Your story like many others on here are absolutely priceless for new scooter users who are just starting out and just don't realise how dangerous riding can be. It's because of these posts that I got a full faced helmet on day 1. I've got 700km in and have yet to have a serious crash, but every so often, small stuff ups where I lose balance or my wheel slips under me while I'm turning (on wet pavement) continue to keep me humble."
"If something like that happens, immediately take a picture of the QR code on the the scooter and note the name/brand of the company (if it’s a rental). It can be tracked to the rider by the time and the unique code. By contacting the scooter company or a personal injury lawyer you may be eligible for damages."
"Always keep an eye at the road in front of you, consider boots as well to protect your ankles from banging against the side of the scooter (hella painful)."
"The 80 pound Vsett 10+, while heavy, is also a significant percentage of the total weight of me plus the scooter with most of that weight down low because of the motors and battery. So it lowers the center of gravity, helping to keep both tires on the ground."
"Ride within your limits, learn the board and gear up and you will be relatively safe. Dont regret mine one bit. I wish I had another one and I ordered a second onewheel (GT)"
"Don’t expect everyone to speak English. You’ll be understood by younger people in the bigger cities and touristy places but that’s about it. If you happen to speak Russian, that might help, as it’s the most widely spoken foreign language. If you learn a few basic words in Armenian, locals will totally appreciate it."
"Like my other comment said, I checked multiple posts over on r/ skateboarding and all the comments were encouraging and about the hobby itself or skill being shown. Its socially acceptable to not wear a helmet when you're skateboarding, but nobody makes fun of you for wearing one. And you arent looked down on for choosing to wear or not to wear one. I believe in risk assessment and injury mitigation. That is all subjective to the rider's skill and their risk tolerance. The pros getting paid millions of dollars do it, the teens at the skatepark do it"
Falling asleep on the couch.
Stock Car Boy = SCB
“I am looking” means one is interested. I don’t even live in London yet.
"Side note: A fairly decent number of folks I know who've smugly given lectures on the dangers of motorcycles have had zero qualms about shooting between cars on an electric bike / scooter with nothing but a singlet, shorts and a little styrofoam cap for a helmet. Also had no issue with riding home from the pub after a few."
I ordered a Bing King crash bar last week and was looking for skateboard wheels for it this morning 😅
Notice how they don't mention his motives.. Because he is radically anti-white and anti-jewish.
Yeah these deaths make me aroused:
"For direct combat, Ravee emulates a hero that her br-* someone that she knew told her about. By having Winona gellify Ravee’s arm, Ravee can use Act 1 to compress it with kinetic energy, causing it to build up tension and pressure. When the time is right, Ravee can release the arm and add more energy to it, causing it to rocket out forwards with immense speed and force. This is the Swar Kata [Chikari] technique or as the character called it “Gomu-Gomu No Pistol”."
"Not only that but the lie she told to cover it up, a skateboard accident. I mean I was howling with laughter."
Much more attentive to me instead of the environment when at the side. With the two dogs together was less likely either would veer off trail or get distracted. Catching them before they escalate out of control was also quicker and easier.
"Edit: Also in bikejoring the dog is not attached to you but in skateboarding you are running a huge risk also with a crash on to asphalt or into traffic, so super dangerous. Canicross obviously the dog is attached to you but you are not on an unstable object going 20 miles per hour lol."
"Tell me I'm pulling it out of my ass, you know I'm right"
"I hope this will inspire some of you, don’t hesitate to PM if you have any question or recommendation."
"Gino chuckled. ""It is if you sign that waiver in your hands. Technically, we'd be contracting you as a freelance stunt driver. All above board. But we don't cover medical costs. You've got insurance, right?"""
"Every thing that has wheels from a skateboard and up that's on a public road has danger spelled all over it. However, the chances of crashing head first on an electric pole at 130km+ is more on a 200cc bike with 25BHP @10K rpm is much bigger than that of having the same crash on a 100cc scooter with 7.68BHP @8K rpm."
"I would suggest learning basic motor control on a brushless DC motor. A great starter is actually with racing drones. Another great start is also with doing a conversion for an electric moped or scooter. However, that has way way more inherent risk compared to a racing drone. A car battery can kill. A NiCad battery really only has that issue if it massively overheats and even then it is more likely to just cause injury."
"RadiKS called, and they want their skateboard back."
its just the nature of it.
"Son was stupid enough to ride his motorized scooter middle of the street, and father was also stupid enough to give this kind of toy to child. Favara was innocent, this accident occurs because of stupidity of father and son. Favara was in wrong neighbourhood."
The electric scooter is good
Wtf are you talking about??
"There are different kinds of scooter controls.  Some twist, some are levers, like you said, but others still have a bar that passes through the control column, so when yoh have it parallel to the handlebar it stops, when it is closer on the right, it   goes forwards, and when it is closer on the left, it goes backwards. That way rather than having a spring, the only resistance is pressure you apply with your other hand.  Many targets have scooters with this control scheme you could try out."
"as for the assumption that divinium injuries can NOT be healed, this would mean that any injury of that nature should be fatal (ie : wounds won't ever close) like if you got stabbed by a divinium butterknife, you're gonna have a permanent blood faucet in your backside."
"My solution was a motorcycle.  I'm a construction worker, and I do own a truck that I use for renovations on my own property as well as hauling materials and tools when I have to.  That said, I went from 10 mpg to about 55 and I'm saving $21-57 a day on parking because of reduced rates for bikes and scooters.  In some areas I can even park for free at bicycle racks.  (Pro tip, put a cover on your bike and everyone assumes it's an electric scooter and leaves it alone even if it isn't technically allowed.)"
"Is that worth it to you? Sure, you're looking at a little better than half the price per round, but you're going to be dropping about $150 (before shipping) on just consumables, and that's 5 boxes of ammo from your lgs right there. You'll have to pick up more projectiles and jugs of go-dust if you plan to use up all those primers too. That's without the cost of all the tools, the dedicated space you put all the stuff, and however much you value your time."
Will Dustin's leg be the same next season? What about Steve's bites? Will these impact our characters next season?
"And then we get into EV motorcycles. There's two huge problems here: cost, and aerodynamic drag. You can avoid both of them by aiming for a lower performance level - those 50 or 125/150 cc classes are going much slower and drag is much less of a problem, which reduces the amount of battery needed, which reduces the cost. And, get the batteries small enough, and you can make them human-portable, making charging easier in denser housing (instead of deploying charging at on-street parking, increasing the sunk costs of that parking and making it harder to get rid of, you can simply have people carry batteries into their home to charge), and making battery swapping practical for longer journeys (see things like the Gogoro Network)."
"As a very strong wheelchair user who once used standing mobility aids, even I get tired at Disney and need a power assist.  If you use a knee scooter for miles a day, not only will you likely cause a stress injury in your hips, you also will likely experience great fatigue in your hands and arms due to maintaining balance."
"Then 4 kids got killed in an accident involving a Stint and a train. The Stint was a electric transport vehicle used to transport kids between school and out of school care. This of course caused a huge outcry and an investigation. It was found that the oversight by the RDW was not strict enough. This led the RDW going from one extreme, almost everything goes, to the other extreme, we really need to know about all the safety implications before we give the OK. So the bar to get a e-scooter legal in the Netherlands is very high and most manufacturers don't care and the importers don't have the budget to go through the process."
Russian Doll season 2 is very good so far. I didn't know where they were going to go with it after season 1 but the approach they've taken is very good.
"We don’t have a pit, but their dog who is huge loves to suddenly take off running at other people or dogs- never attacks but thinks it’s fun to run full tilt at them barking like a maniac and then stop 2 feet away to wag their tail. And my parents are like “oh he won’t hurt you!” While they chase him laughing, and I’m thinking that if a huge dog came running at me I will fucking kick it and its irresponsible as hell to let dogs who do that off their leash."
"When I worked at target, everyone knew about this old man who would ride around in one of those electric wheelchairs. He would constantly knock down the Starbucks shelves on ""accident"" and speed away on his scooter."
"I was riding my skateboard through town to meet a friend at a restaurant. I was going downhill, and didn't see a chunk of sidewalk just, missing. Ended up crashing face-first into the pavement, breaking my nose and fracturing my elbow. I was in pain, and I was bleeding profusely from my face, but all I kept thinking was how I was going to clean up the blood so I could meet my friend, and that I hope he didn't see that embarrassing crash! Those thoughts started to go away once I got stuffed into the back of an ambulance, lol. Funny how that's basically a universal experience."

"2 parts for the base,"
Shooting someone for throwing a rock at you is unjust.
"Without a crash/stunt cage and a skateboard strapped to it, this is just 2-wheeled insanity."
I’ve had people help me when I fallen before while riding my scooter and ask me if I was ok but it’s unfortunate that’s the attitude of society right now is a lot of people have little sympathy for someone crashing or getting hit by a car. It’s not like this type of victim blaming isn’t also common when it comes to cyclists or pedestrians being hit though
he probably got into a fight or is just another skateboard injury lol
A scooter has a lower center of gravity and tend to go a bit slower than an electric bike so I was thinking of getting one so I can get around easier.
"Once, there was a Mother with her child. She was once crossing the street at night, and was unfortunately run over by a Vehicle (different versions have different vehicles). She was flung away from her child. She crawled to her child, only to find out he has passed away. She died before she could even reach him. It is said that her Spirit haunts that area starting from 11 p.m. A friend told me a story that happened with his uncle there~"
Molina even tweeted pictures of himself at the car show with Deputy Commissioner Patricia Lyons and his security aide Captain Davelle Williams on his official Twitter account.
If you did this intentionally you did something illega and you gonna go to jail either wayl.
"Hayden was seen on a number of occasions on November 4 struggling to control the dog as it lunges towards people walking to and from the shop, including nearby children. Salter can be seen to be present during some of the incidents, including while the dog is barking viciously and pulling towards a young girl, who looks fearful and retreats behind a car."
"I was in a college program and had to be held back due to an electric scooter injury. I heard that the classes after me, during orientation get coached not to use electric scooters."
So what do you mean by 'bikes make roads more dangerous for everyone else'?
"Vehicle crash deaths are down in the city so far this year, the NYPD says.As of Thursday, 107 people have been killed in car crashes, eight fewer than this time last year, cops said.Pedestrian fatalities in the five boroughs have dropped 22%, from 62 at this point in 2021 to 48 so far in 2022, NYPD statistics show. Six bicyclists and five people on electric scooters and other electric devices have died so far this year ― the same as died in the same period of 2021, the data show."
I'm in the US and have had nothing but problems with them since ordering a board in August of 2021.
I’ve literally seen the imported ones that can go at 60km/hr among car traffic and always think to myself you’re gonna end up dead if you crash. Or worse with spastic paraplegia/quadriplegia and a life not worth living.
"Yeah, I had a head-on crash with two drunk girls on a rental electric scooter. They flew around a blind corner on the pavement and the one driving panicked and hit the power hitting me at full speed."
This happened in Wisconsin. Also you’d probably be acquitted in Virginia too. I spend a fair amount of time there and the self defense laws are pretty permissive compared to some other places.
Blowing out candles on your birthday.
"The biggest danger to bikes and e-scooters are cars. They did do a study and found e-scooters are 7 times more likely to get into an accident (0.07% per 10.000km) but that was with an incredibly small sample size and e-scooters are a new thing so it could just be an anomaly, but I haven't looked into the study yet. Also e-scooters are only allowed to go 20 km/h which is slower than what I used to do on a bike, sadly I can't do that anymore because of chronic health problems like chronic pain so it's mostly a mobility scooter for me."
"He didn’t provoke anything. He walked towards a fire from a Blm right where people were planning to blow stuff up, and he was attacked. He didn’t force them to attack. He even lowered his gun when he saw people stopping."
Thanks for any advice!
Sucks? Yes. Massively safer than drunk driver deaths? Also yes
😮“SPOILER ALERT: A major earthquake will hit your neighbourhood in sixteen minutes”
"I called my brother last year when he had fallen off his electric skateboard and apple alerted me. His crash helmet was nearly destroyed as he smacked it hard. He didn’t know why I was calling and was very confused as he had just come off, had concussion and needed to get checked out at a hospital. It’s a great feature."
Also booties might be something you want to look at as well depending on your area and your end goal. Asphalt and concrete can get hot and there’s always potential here for glass or garbage around the sidewalks and roads. Even sharp rocks and gravel.
"As a frankly ludicrous amount of corpses scatter the stage, poor poor Errok won’t be able to get a bead on his mark. Once this combo gets going, it’s hard to stop, baby! But all good things come to an end, and after a few minutes the Infinite Death Spiral will rev down…"
"Even when I was working at my start up gig, I often went without eating three square meals a day. Now that I was out of steady income, I figured the whole not being able to die thing would make it so I didn't have to eat anymore. Funny thing about that. I didn't need to eat anymore, but it didn't make the hunger stop. Didn't make the pangs subside. The headaches. The delirium. Six weeks without a meal and I was staring at my own arm like it was an uncooked roast waiting for the oven. Those were dark times."
"Senior dogs and dogs who are injured or ill. Medically fragile dogs still want to enjoy the outdoors too and their humans are often already under the emotional strain of injury/illness recovery or end of life care for a beloved pet. Maybe the dog is just a grumpy, arthritic senior. They have likely chosen a designated on-leash area for a reason. They deserve to walk safely and in peace as do all dogs."
"“Mom, are you okay?”"
"At 1:28 AM Saturday, July 9, 2022, Bulloch County 911 dispatched Bulloch County EMS to 620 Fair Road, directly across from the Food World grocery store, for a Lime electric scooter accident. Statesboro Police officers were on the scene and reported the male victim was unresponsive."
From the original video:
I think that is a great idea; my only two comments are:
"Meanwhile I see bicyclist, scooter riders, and pedestrians acting as if there are no cars, or even other bicycles, scooters or pedestrians on the road at all."
"Spent 4 days in Thailand, in Kho Tao,  number of years back before going across to Vietnam. A good number of people in crutches with leg injuries and a much larger number with bandages on their inside legs from scooter exhaust burns. Drunken scooter riding was the norm and seemed to be the main cause of injury."
Good night sleep before
"Though if your interested in skateboarders going down hills at speed if look into bombing, those guys scare me, there's a guy in New Zealand who should be a poster boy for practically all helmet companies, he goes raw and on thin ass wheels which scare the hell of me cause I expect tricks on his set-up"
"It's not necessarily bad, but forcing you to draw insurance on every electric scooter you own is an unnecessary cost considering electric scooter riders are the less likely to survive a crash between an actual motorvehicle and a 5-30kg, 13mph limited electric scooter."
"If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me.  I actually have been thinking about learning to be a travel agent since so many people don't know this stuff and there currently aren't SEOed travel agents for Disney that specialise in accessible travel besides for young kids with autism.  If you think that might have been useful to you, let me know.  My wife is pushing me to do it, but I am not sure how much interest or demand is actually out there."
"Mr James said: “Beast jumped up and put his two paws on his shoulders, causing him to fall to the floor. That is when Beast was seen beginning to attack Jack.”"
i was skating down a steep parking lot and i went so fast the only way to stop was by jumping off of it. a car was coming towards me from the left and i jumped off the skateboard just as we were about to crash. i was fine but the board got stuck under a car and getting it back was a pain in the ass
"A few weeks ago after the fight had happened, two of the younger kids were involved in a electric scooter crash, they both went to hospital and one is in critical condition. I would not wish that on anyone but I can’t help but think of how karma has taken place here."
"No. Thatcher was responsible for the holocaust, the Armenian genocide, WW2, the Korean war, the Vietnam War, 9/11, the Arab Spring, the Crusades, the Islamic invasion of Spain, the formation of Israel,she was also responsible for driving the Jews out of Israel in the first place,in fact the Egyptians did nothing wrong; it was Thatcher who was responsible for enslaving the Jews. Thatcher is secretly a scaly and one day while she was wearing her snake suits she tricked Eve and told her to eat the apple.she also killed Abel.she also led the Mongol invasions everywhere. And the Hun invasions. And the Mughal invasions of India. And the Viking invasions.Thatcher was the one who started colonialism. After Thatcher tested positive for Covid19,she spit on Native Americans, nearly driving them extinct. Thatcher also killed all the dinosaurs.she was also behind the Bronze age collapse. Thatcher single-handedly did the Triangular Slave Trade; hellshe was the guy Thatcher bought the slaves from. Thatcher also beheaded a French teacher for disrespecting Muhammad, and blamed it on wholesome Muslimerinos. All the blood diamonds are produced by Thatcher.she was the one who cut Congolese workers hands off because they did not meet Leopolds supply. Thatcher chased Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha with a skateboard and beat him up and snatched his rifle, and used it to kill Jacob Blake. During the BLM protests Thatcher was the one who looted and burned all the stores. Even during the Charolletsville incident, they were all shadow-clones of Thatcher. Thatcher did Pearl Harbor and bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Thatcher was the mastermind of the Holodomor, she ate the grain and blamed Stalin, the Great Leap Forward, Thatcher was involved, not Mao. Thatcher grilled the last dodo. Thatcher shoots Palestinian kids for fun and shoots missiles at Israeli civilians.she killed all those Rohingyas, and Uyghurs.she was also involved the current Hong Kong situation; so much involved that she was the one who sold opium to the Chinese. The Irish potato famine, Africa, the Bengal Famine; all because of Thatcher. Thatcher commits human rights violations on North Korean citizens everyday. Al Qaeda, Mujaheddin, Boko-Haram, Taliban; Thatcher.she also killed the prophet of the wholesome 100 Muslimerinos, Sulemani; in a missile strike.she also did the Rape of Nanjing and it was Thatcher who ordered and supplied all the Korean comfort women. Thatcher personally snitched on Anne Frank. The Jim Crow laws were passed by Thatcher, as well as the war on drugs. The partition of India was Thatcher's fault, as well as the resulting Kashmir issue.she also starred in the Cuban missile crisis and started the cold war. During the Russian Revolution, Lenin understood that Nikolai II's family was innocent, and would offer them a chance to leave, but Thatcher massacred them. Thatcher tried her best but failed in preventing the French Revolution, but she got back at them by causing the Reign of Terror. Thatcher tortured Louis XVI's son and forced him into saying that she had sex with his mother and aunt, and promptly guillotined them. Thatcher invented pineapple-pizza and Tofu-Chicken.she was the guy who snitched on Alan Turing, revealing that she was gay. The judge felt that such a respected professor could be sent away with a slap on the wrist, but Thatcher rigged the jury and sentenced him to hormonal therapy. Thatcher rigged the New York Stock Exchange and caused the great depression. In the town of Waco,sheraped a woman, blamed it on a black man and lynched him by burning him alive.she was the leader of the Khmer Rouge and wrote the plot for the Star Wars holiday Special. Despite making up only 3.0211238398812703164724804575659e-7 % of the population Margaret Thatcher commits 100% of the crimes. Thatcher also was the dictator of Uganda. Thatcher regularly kills journalists and opposition leaders in Russia.she was behind Princess Diana's car crash. Thatcher fucked a monkey and started the AIDS pandemic.shestarted coronavirus and ebola and the Black Death and the Spanish flu and the Bubonic plague and the syphillis outbreak and the Trojan war and the Bush war and the fall of Rome and the Dark Ages. After taking a dump, Thatcher leaves her toilet paper like this. Thatcher burned down the Notre Dame, and kneeled on George Floyds neck.she also sold drugs to George Floyd. Thatcher is the reason I am the only person in my class who doesn't have a girlfriend. Thatcher is the reason why the Armenia Azerbaijan crisis is even there."
Late night phone conversations with good friends.
"The result is incredible and beats my expectations. The fender adds about 6 pounds to the board, but I can ride what seems like forever compared to what I was used to. Technically speaking, I haven’t managed to discharge the battery completely, riding for more than 2 hours is a leg killer and I need to stop. The most I’ve managed to do was 23 miles with 8% battery left, according to the Onewheel App. Not only the range improvement, a noticeable change is how the board handles uphills now, having extra capacity provides 2 major improvements:"
He then returned to the scene and has been cooperating with FHP investigators. He was not injured in the crash.
What happens as it is if a cyclist is drunk or is in a crash?
"A pebble weighs a couple grams and a person weighs hundreds of pounds, and yet it can still fling you off a skateboard."
"A motorcycle isn’t always the best transportation solution. However I come from the world of cycling, over there I was bombing hills and burning bridges at 20-60mph in essentially tissue paper for clothing and tires the width of skateboard wheels. The gear I wear on my moto is exponentially improving my margin of safety in comparison. I understand my regular pants and shoes wont hold up in a moto crash but that’s the risk I take with “most of the gear most of the time”."
Still needs a pack / module. It’s a structural pack. The entire pack provides rigidity to the car “skateboard”.  Versus the current pack is not crash proof.  Needs and exo frame to provide increased rigidity.
"She and her friend are so flipping rude. Assholes for sure! Someone shows care and concern and yes, has probably seen plenty of broken noses and concussions so knows a little bit and they mock her? How is that kind and Christian? Ugh."

"NTA. Your wheelchair is your mobility aid. It is not a storage place for everyone else. I use a mobility scooter because of cancer in my spine. I've also used a wheelchair. When people put their stuff on the chair, it can unbalance the whole chair and cause the chair to fall over which is extremely dangerous. Items can also hit the person using the wheelchair causing serious injury. Plus expecting you to sit on a filthy and sticky chair is disgusting. You deserve to be comfortable and safe when out and about in your chair."
Did doggo crash into the scooter at the end?
"The most visible immediate changes have been with the team — in Xavi’s first three games in charge Barcelona have been playing with more confidence and intensity, pressing higher and harder, taking more risks, breaking forward with more players."

first time getting crossed. haven’t eaten anything all day except some shitty pizza n i go out to a bar cause we don’t start work til the next week as RAs and onlh have the soccer teams on campus at the moment. Ive had a couple beers but i’m absolutely cooked and decide to blinker my pen in the bathroom a few times before we leave.
"If you are comfortable pushing and falling, the sky is the limit."
"I can't imagine riding my electric scooter seeing that there is a pair of headlights in front of me. I'd move the fuck to the side especially in a lot like that. No awareness for someone who rides a motorcycle, this is really bad."
"I've ridden an electric scooter home from Bunnings with 20kg of stones in a backpack, nothing like the thrill of 'if I have to brake/swerve I'm crashing and dying'. I am a colossal idiot."
"Now, I bought another no brand electric maxi scooter, and it has gone through hell and back (literally, check my post history) and it's still going strong, battery still holds 85-95% of the original charge after a year of constant use, motor got slightly damaged in the crash, so it lost like 1/3 of power, but I can see myself using it for at least 5-7 years more."
"In a moment that isn’t so doom and gloom, take the scene where the skateboard kid returns the cross necklace lost at the scene of the accident. Binoche laughing in the cafe is one of the great cinematic laughs in a very similar way to Garbo doing the same in Ninotchka for me, in it feeling very pivotal for such a closed off character to express momentary and unplanned joy and getting lost in the moment. Although for a second I thought the joke she was explaining meant diarrheaing will distract the woman from the cough, but it’s actually a vomit joke. And people say arthouse movies are too remote. But the grimmest moments truly will devastate anyone with a heart. 5-year-old Anna in the last moments of her life being the first character we meet is just brutal. And speaking of that first scene, Kieslowski cannot be denied a master’s title and here’s the proof: We see Julie’s husband stretch on the driver’s side so it’s established that way that the accident was truly out of Julie’s hands. Let the helplessness of the situation dawn. I didn’t even notice this until this last viewing."
A quick sidenote... Just because my scooter is better at stopping doesn't mean I'm more reckless on it. I still don't want to come off or crash into someone. I'm just saying compared to a bike they are safer than most people think and should be legal.
"duck! I've gotta admit, I'd still be remembering that one with embarrassment if I'd done that. Not a huge deal, though."
"Question 1: is it likely this thin layer of dirt is the reason I was losing grip, or could I just have shit technique?"
You can absolutely do this.
I appreciate the kick in the pants I honestly needed it. My doctor just put me on a knee scooter and the idea of rolling into court and jail on that thing is psyching me out. But you're right that I need to just do my best and if I crash and burn so be it.
Indian here. In the Capital of India (New Delhi) there's been an urban legend for a particular borough of the City. It's called Delhi Cantonment area. The urban legend goes like this-
"That person who complains that Wal-Mart is somehow responsible for ruining their lives, but never leaves."
"And whilst it **LOOKS** impressive (thanks to the camera gear), it isn't that impressive. If you can hit 35-40mph comfortably, 50mph isn't a stretch"

"James: A truck is a truck, Ted! If anything the fact that it was an ice cream truck made it worse, on account of all the laughing children... I feel like you're not grasping the gravity of the situation. I had to get ambulanced to the hospital, Ted. Ambulanced!"
"This all from a messily 12 mph. I’m not trying to lecture OP or be rude but going 60mph on one of these is down right dangerous. Please be careful, this gear would save you a lot of the damages this woman had in a 12mph crash, but I don’t think it would do much at 60mph. Source: I also ride! I had in the past 2 Suzuki gsxrs (no longer ride due to heart issues) so I switched to e scooters for a much safer thrill. Now have 2 segway ninebot."
the wife.  The boss was clearly NOT mortified. This is OP being weirdly mortified for another person who... get this... has a sense of humor about their minor error.
I had an electric scooter growing up. Didn’t have an injury once and think they’re great.
"you likely just need more practice until its second nature, like breathing."
"The scooter can go through every queue line at DCA. It cannot go in every queue line at DL. Instead, you can talk to the cast member standing at the exit of the ride. If you have a LL pass, the cast member will scan you there and let you walk to the ride via exit. If you don’t have a LL pass, they will give you a return pass with a time equivalent to the line’s current wait time minus 10 minutes. Example: if Peter Pan’s current wait is 40 minutes, the cast member at the exit will give you a return pass for 30 mins from that moment and you have a 10 minute window to use it and walk to the ride via the exit."
"Yes, I think it's important to be safe. Some of the most important steps to being safe are; (1) learn the terrain you will be riding. (2) Know how to properly handle your scooter."
Almost died nearly avoiding a bus which was my oncoming traffic. Was able to slow down enough to get back in lane. Never wanted to kill a person so badly in my life for the stress I've been put through.
How long ago was the injury? Is this pre-opp or post opp (if needed)? How long past the opp?
"I ride a OneWheel, which is an electric skateboard. I have had pain in the blade of my lead foot for about a year, which I attributed to also having plantar fasciitis. Recently I rolled the ankle of that lead foot while riding and the pain in the blade of that foot got worse."
"I'm the same age as you but I switched to an electric skateboard since I don't fancy tricks anymore, its an accident waiting to happen."
"Definitely has much more hill climb power, I was able to claw right up Octavia into Layfeyette park, climb out of the Marina, even went up the cable car route from the wharf past the new Russian hill park.  Sure it slows to 6-8mph on a good climb, but I didn’t encounter any stalls.  These places are a total no-go for the L9."
"Had an interesting one the other day. So I have this mountain bike helmet that I wear when I ride my electric skateboard. It has a sun visor, which I had removed and lost. I was thinking about how I'd like to find it, but I actually assumed it was left in my previous apartment by accident and possibly gone for good. But later that day I was in the car and dropped my phone under the seat. I reach under the seat to get it, and boom, the visor is right there. Don't know what to make of that."
"Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office, declined comment Wednesday. The Legal Aid Society, which is representing the plaintiffs in the Nunez case, also declined comment."
"Autonomy: managed to ride for 23miles, but never managed to completely dry the battery out."
"I'll be happily chasing an adrenaline rush and then suddenly I run out of spoons, get super tense, and crash and burn (sometimes literally with the crashing of bikes, electric scooters, and me on roller skates)."
"Sure, so, I sold it a while back cause I got a gf and needed a 2 seater."
"While sequels White and Red would go on to involve themselves with the trio’s others of equality and fraternity, the age-old French conception of liberty is what kickstarter Three Colors Blue pertains to at its heart, and it is I would say a “freedom from” over “freedom to” type. The ability to do things freely is what people tend to want to die for and what they think freedom means before anything else, but just as valuable is feeling safe and secure in the assurance that threatening forces aren't going to be penetrative. In this case, that is excruciating memory. Julie, the principal character of this installment, is in a cell of fate’s making, and posted at the top of that prison is “Grief.” The most personal loss of life for many is worse than losing your own, and if it’s in doubt the first act we see Julie take is treating that as a more acceptable alternative. Through the course of Blue she repeatedly endures sudden voids of energy and drive even after attempts to continue living, and in this despondent funk she’s propelled forward by purely mechanical movements."
"Molina tweeted the pictures on April 15. But well-placed sources said the images were snapped the day before, when the meeting with the feds was held."
Every crash I've had on the onewheel was user error. I was being a dumbass and the board let me know it.
"If you have no interest in learning tricks and just want an efficient method of transportation, a longboard is the way to go over a typical skateboard."
That's like asking if you are going to crash your car someday.
Check out canicross or bikejoring. There are a lot more resources you can check out on those topics that can be relevant.
"Just as you want to stay ahead of the pain with ibuprofen and RICE, stay ahead of depression by addressing mobility and hygiene challenges now."
"When both batteries are balanced and need charging, I can just turn the switch on and charge them together using the board charger port."
"Also, your skateboard example. Did the child crash with no pads or helmet? Where were they riding? What were the conditions? A 5 year old with no pads or helmet on a wet busy highway after dark. A 5 year old fully padded in a quiet grassed park."
Now you can stand back and ride your fav deck. It’s like finally attaining the ability to enjoy the cruise without feeling like you’re gonna crash at any moment
Riding without a helmet is a good way to leak your spinal fluid out of your ears :)
"I do not have a positive history with dogs, most places I lived dogs were mean and wanted to hurt you and people wanted them to hurt you or they thought it was funny. I like em now, but am still wary."
My phone buzzed.
"Although their sense of balance had been trained by years of flying, 100 French airmen recently found cycle skating was more difficult than piloting an airplane when they took part in a race in Paris. Many accidents resulted, although all of the fliers were ardent bicycle riders who, despite their air duties, have never wholly forsaken their training on wheels."
"ps anyone who honks at people are dumbasses who shouldnt have a license because they are unfit to drive responsable and safely, road ragers should have their licenses revoked for scaring other and new drivers by making them crash and miss their turns."
"Humans without dogs who for whatever reason do not wish to be approached by your off-leash dog in an on-leash designated area. They may be fearful, allergic, injured or infirm, have small children in tow, be on a bicycle, skateboard, or scooter, or simply not want to be approached by unknown dogs at that time. They deserve to use the public space safely and in peace too."
Even if TSLA beats earnings they’re still overpriced compared to everything else that has gone down. They almost have to correct
They knew that child can be sick yet they choose to breed. That should be enough. Maybe they even had genetic condition and they knew that child had 50% chance of developing painful kidney failure.
"Oh, reddit's favorite objective argument: Assuming the guy who's arguments you don't like is ""too young"". Still number one right in front of just making up percentages to make a point."
Another Electric Scooter Catches Fire; Third Incident in a Week
I won't preach... I will just let others do it ;)
"Always wear a helmet when unsecured on wheels (bicycle, skateboard, roller scates, hoverboard, etc). If you have a serious enough crash to call for emergency services, don't take the helmet off until they arrive."
I really don’t trust escooters - they’re so much more unstable than bicycles but people charge around on them at speed with no helmet on.
"That feeling is also shared by Xavi. “Xavi is the most excited of everyone,” a source who knows him well tells The Athletic. “This is a dream he has been working towards for a long time. He is very convinced that everything will go well — he and his staff.”"
A few suggestions:
James: We've been over this. I never scooted a damn thing. It was a vehicular cycling device.
And felt absolutely pumped and amazing!
"If I were OP in this situation my ""proactive driving"" probably would have just been to take my foot off the accelerator and pre-load the brakes in case I needed to stop, but I in all likelihood would not have visibly slowed down much from the perspective of the dash cam. In fact if you look closely, you can see the front of the car in the OP dip slightly as it approaches the crosswalk, indicating he was probably already on the brakes as well. In the end, the guy running the light got through without incident, and at those speeds even if scooter bro had stopped suddenly dead center in the crosswalk, a car with good tires and brakes and an attentive driver could have stopped in time to prevent injury."
"Everything started when my girlfriend bought herself an electric scooter. We wanted to go on long rides and cruise around the hilly San Francisco together. As a Pint rider, you can imagine that competing with her 20miles range didn’t go so well for me. 3-4 miles into the ride, we had to turn around or keep going to the 8 miles deadly limit and pay for an Uber / Lyft back."
One of the screening mechanisms I used with dates as a teenager was to show them the movie Kids because I found that the kinds of girls who could see Chloe Sevigny get AIDS and not be completely turned off were usually the kind of freaks I wanted to know.
"Driving without functioning or illuminated headlights, unless no headlights are functioning or illuminated and the sun has set. (Cal. Veh. Code § 24400(a)-(b))."
"In China some 15 years back, there was an explosion of e-scooters and mopeds and they were clearly preferred by the average city dweller but according to Chinese authorities, they were causing a nuisance parking wise, spilling all over pavements. In spite of the fact that obviously they take up less space than cars. Then they moved to discourage them. Prior to this in just a year or two I recall that some 5 million e-mopeheads had been taken up and were wildly popular."
