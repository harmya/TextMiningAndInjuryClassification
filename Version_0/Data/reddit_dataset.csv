"say, for example, you're watching this skateboarding video and these skaters get into accidents, like falling down face\-first or grinding down a railing then slip and land on their genitals.or if you are standing on a bridge and look over the side and see the deep, vast expanse below and then bam! jelly\-like feeling and you are left immobile and crouching."
"let's say you want to reload gr projectiles with imr . again, just an example, as there a ton of options. the recipe calls for  grains of powder. a lb jug of powder is  grains, and that figures to something like -ish rounds. that jug will also cost somewhere around $ (according to the hodgdon site). on a lark, you spent $ dollars at the winchester site and picked up  large rifle primers. assuming no errors or accidents (lol), those are good for, well,  rounds. you also went to the same random reloading supply website i clicked and picked up a  count box of  grain poly-tipped spitzers for about $."
"the handshake. again, the only mortifying thing was this person's reaction. ""oh god! i didn't land the handshake perfectly!"" what is wrong with these people?"
"looking at converting  percent of the space currently devoted for cars into space for people, here is one vision of what new yorkers could have instead:"
"just last week i crashed on my electric scooter into a guy on a bike in front of giesel, broke my hand, got surgery ( screws and a plate) at ucsd jacobs medical center and now i’m home  hours away from campus and i can barely move my hand. y’all be careful for real out there!!"
the investigation is being handled by the chp (not ucsb pd) to prevent risk of bias.
"i only have a helmet right now, but will be getting knee, elbow, and wrist guards soon."
"spent  days in thailand, in kho tao,  number of years back before going across to vietnam. a good number of people in crutches with leg injuries and a much larger number with bandages on their inside legs from scooter exhaust burns. drunken scooter riding was the norm and seemed to be the main cause of injury."
hey all. i’m trying to find a sub where people post their skateboarding fails and bails. some like thrasher’s hall of meat. i haven’t been able to find anything. thanks!
"my understanding of it means that the batteries are part of the car for life. so, no more removable packs. if something goes wrong with them, the car is essentially financially totalled from not only the cost of a replacement, but the cost of labor as well. if it's even at all made possible."
"just today i overhead a tourist telling another his friend got sent home with a head injury after flying into a barrier. with the lack of strict road rules in place, no protective gear and a lot of tourists (many drinking of course) why take the risk?"
"“shit,” i mumbled to myself as someone pushed past me, coughing. then my phone rang, it was mom."
there's always an anarchistic period that comes with disruption. the bad faith actors try to prolong it while people like me advocate for new equitable classifications.
"if you like to cycle around a lot, use a skateboard or a scooter, learn to roll with your landings, for when you crash or find yourself having to stop very abruptly. it minimise damage and ensures that you have the reflex to avoid landing on any single part of your body if you get launched into the air."
"my friend just told me i can find a used boosted deck as it already has the cable 'well' already in it and in some cases, comes with the cables. i'm just not sure if they'd be compatible with the esc of my exway. if anyone has any help or advise i'd really appreciate it. i love in the uk if that's of any help. thanks in advance guys."
"like if you’re learning to skateboard and you scrape your knee, if you go running home instead of trying again you won’t become the next tony hawk."
i have to remind myself it’s their risk not mine. but i still couldn’t live with myself if i managed to accidentally kill one.
"additionally, performance matters a lot. (i'll use cc here to describe classes of motorcycle, even when referring to electric.) a  or a / cc motorcycle is a completely different beast from a // or even a  (unless it's something low-revving like a royal enfield, where their  performs like a ).  cc stuff may even struggle to keep up with cars on current american surface streets, / cc stuff often can't go much faster than that. therefore, both of those classes can reduce urban sprawl compared to a car just through being slower. (however, the / cc class can absolutely do a lot of damage in a crash if ridden irresponsibly, significantly more than bicycles.) the faster stuff, though, once you're freeway-capable..."

"i ride a onewheel, which is an electric skateboard. i have had pain in the blade of my lead foot for about a year, which i attributed to also having plantar fasciitis. recently i rolled the ankle of that lead foot while riding and the pain in the blade of that foot got worse."
this is just to funny > [ some digging and it turns out there was a round  very recently > [
"and i was in there cause i crashed an electric street rental scooter somehow when i wasn't looking, and i woke up in an ambulance van, and i was yelling at them to take me home, not cause i was going crazy but cause i was actually scared and scared of the bill i was gonna get lol."
"i chose bike because one wheel is more likely to cause a faceplant when it’s broken, and skateboard is more likely to crash down hill(bad braking power, i almost ram one over…."
from the original video:
he was then laying in the outside lane when a  dodge charger ran over the victim.
"back before the tinder days i met a random girl from the internet at her apartment for the olden days version of a netflix and chill.  she was telling me how she worked at the hard rock as a housekeeper and that one of the perks of the job was that pretty reliably she would find leftover bags of cocaine and other drugs in the rooms after guests checked out.  that story along with a few others made me feel pretty sketchy but i had poor impulse control so we had sex anyway.  it wasn't really going very well initially, but at some point it started to get really good.  after we finished i realize that the part where things got good were because the condom had broken and i started having a mild panic attack about the possibility of getting this chick pregnant because as bad as all my stories were she was worse.  she doesn't seem concerned and just takes a shower and goes to bed but i can't rest at all, as soon as the sun comes up i take off to the pharmacy and show back up at her door about an hour later with some plan b pills and relay the pharmacist instructions to her."
"looks like one of those chicks that grabs a guy’s skateboard, to flirt, can’t ride so the guy has to help her not crash."
here’s where i think you should direct your focus.
"they are being walked by someone other than their owner. shelter dogs out on field trips and client dogs out with pet sitters, trainers, & dog walkers are a normal part of the community. they deserve to walk safely in peace as do all dogs."
"“hey!” the driver shouted but before i heard anymore i jumped from the cab, rolling onto some grass on the side of the road. a moment later tires screeched and the cab ploughed into a traffic light, glass smashing everywhere."
"ok, i know this sounds weird, but when i was quite young i watched a tv movie about the beach boys. at some point in the film there was a scene were one of them was being dragged behind a car on a skate board and was hit by an oncoming car. this member (too long ago to remember which one, but i always assumed it was brian) was left a bit brain damaged, but years later recovered enough to fight be able to play a concert again.now this doesn't sound like anything that i can see actually happened, so either i've remembered the movie being about the wrong band, or they just invented it as a way to not tall about brian's mental health issues.does anyone know about this movie or the actual events, if any?"
ipad pro .
and its a stupid reason. there is no logic-based reason an electric bicycle does not need a license and insurance but an electric scooter does.
...do they tho?  because the cities data seems to indicate that of the  people killed and  serious injured last year... % involved cars or motorcycles.
"just wanted to know before i buy one, my area sucks for walking"
____________________________
how many students use bikes/skateboards/scooters to get around campus? i'll be an engineering student so i suspect i'll have to get to the equad often which is in the corner of campus. would it be worth the investment to get an electric scooter over a manual bike based on the terrrain of campus?
"also, deliberately pushes his (possibly rental) scooter under the bmw in order to provoke an accident."
"hear me out. now i have fantasy booked guys like mjf, danielson, wardlow, miro, kingston as potential winners of the battle royale - and while all those names would make for a fantastic match at the end of dynamite, i'm not sure any of those names in an improtu (unadvertised) main event with moxley - who is likely winning the match - would benefit aew's ratings or whoever takes the loss. most of those names - particularly wardlow and miro - should not be losing right now anyway.now perhaps i'm taking it for granted that moxley is winning on dynamite. between the built-in history between moxley and tanahashi, the fact he was the first person announced for this eliminator-style tournament (despite being # ranked before rampage aired) and the battle royale winner having to wrestle twice (giving them an automatic out for losing) - it just seems like a foregone conclusion that moxley will beat the battle royale winner on wednesday. so wouldn't it make sense to use that battle royale spot to elevate someone? someone who likely won't get a title shot against moxley and/or cm punk down the line? someone who will have a great match with moxley at the end of dynamite, but also won't be hurt by a loss (if it's in a competitive, brutal match)?with injuries to cm punk, kenny omega, adam cole (and potentially scorpio sky) - elevating someone unlikely feels like the smart move. aew has always done a great job of putting unlikely people in high profile spots and having them shine. darby allin against chris jericho (on one of the very first episodes of dynamite), jungle boy against kenny omega, orange cassidy against pac, private party against the young bucks, dante martin against kenny omega and the young bucks. a battle royale stipulation also means that nobody is going to look weak losing to an up and coming star. we've seen moxley have star-making matches with guys like wheeler yuta and daniel garcia of late - i would love to see the battle royale winner be someone unlikely.my # pick would be **ricky starks**. admittedly i'm bias - he's been one of my favourite wrestlers since his nwa days - but starks is a guy who feels like he's getting more and more over with every passing week. all he needs now is that one ""star making"" performance to push him over the edge. this could be it. i truly believe a blackpool combat club-style match (which we know he's capable of - thumbtack skateboard anyone?) with moxley would be what gets him there. we've seen the showmanship and flamboyancy of ricky starks - this would be an opportunity to see a more serious side of his wrestling persona. to see if he can be believably brutal and violent when in the ring with a pitbull like mox.another great option would be **swerve strickland**. he's someone who came in with a lot of hype, but didn't quite have the fanfare of the other recent ex-wwe signings (being that his entire nxt run was during the ""wednesday night wars""). he's gotten great shine from being paired with keith lee and is starting to build momentum in his own right (after winning the triple threat against jungle boy and starks). a big-time main event dynamite match with moxley could be exactly what he needs to kickstart his singles career.there are so many incredible options up and down the roster for this spot. **buddy matthews** is another guy that we know is capable of star-making performances (anyone else remember his main event smackdown match against roman reigns a few years back? - now imagine if that momentum had been followed up on and wwe had done something with him off the back of it). he's someone who hasn't been given a singles match in aew yet and has explosive talent that the audience needs to be reminded of.**powerhouse hobbs** is another guy who looks ready to explode and a brutal match with moxley could be exactly what he needs. he's improved all facets of his game out of sight in the last  months and i think a singles match with moxley would go much different than his matches with moxley in .**kyle o'reilly** is someone coming off a big win against darby allin and, much to my surprise, looks like someone tony khan sees as a big player in the aew singles division. while i think there's much more value in redragon as a team, if you're wanting to put kyle o'reilly over big as a singles competitor, this would be a great way to do it. a match with moxley would definitely give him credibility with the aew audience (who have seemed lukewarm on him since his arrival).**lee moriarty** is someone that has been ear-marked for the bcc by fans and hasn't really been given an opportunity to show what he can do yet. i wouldn't be disappointed if he found himself in this spot - particularly considering the storyline ramifications off the back of it.just food for thought as everyone fantasy books this battle royale leading up to wednesday. i just really hope aew doesn't go for the obvious (and put someone who is already made in that spot). or use it as a vehicle to continue the jas vs bcc feud.there is plenty of time for jon moxley vs eddie kingston, jon moxley vs bryan danielson, jon moxley vs miro once the aew interim championship has been established. i don't think we need to rush those scenarios - particularly when the main event match won't be advertised ahead of wednesday."
"hi, i m a newbie roller blader, ( week old). i was practicing at a park but got injured  times - dodging a skateboard and dodging a kid on scooter. i was wondering if you know of any basketball court, which is publicly accessible at night (-pm) and which mostly remains empty? i want to practice without crashing into others during my initial learning phase!i live in downtown, so anyplace close by would be perfect."
"yta   i’m a nurse and the one time i wasn’t home to make him wear a helmet he crashed his skateboard and got a head injury.  head injuries can be serious and preventable with a helmet. again, yta"
"name a stock in history that ever came close to being as over valued as the tsla bubble.   guys, it’s a car company. you ever ride an electric scooter? yeah, that’s basically a small version of a tsla and you guys bid it up to a trillion dollars. you can stop now."
"there’s cool stuff in the us, but all these problems don’t exist at once anywhere else unless the us has had a direct hand in causing those issues (like mexico, se asia and the middle east)"
accidents are a leading cause of death of all ages
almost every scooter crash has the potential to be face first. it's very different than a bike. i strongly recommend full face for any electric scooter.
that could explain things.
"honestly, it's just funny that every skateboard post that's ever been on reddit gets a bunch of people who seem to think they need to tell everyone to wear a helmet. .% of people at this level don't wear helmets. i know a lot of people here think it's just because they want to look cool but i assure you, it's not. are you hearing about professional skateboarders sustaining crazy head injuries all the time? if you're knee jerk reaction to that question is, ""well it does happen, and they should just wear helmets in case"" then it's probably more about thinking you know what's best for others rather than caring for their well being. there are plenty of scenarios in life and especially sports where a helmet would be beneficial in an accident but aren't commonly used for various reasons. major league pitchers don't wear helmets and they get line drives to the head occasionally. i'm sure plenty of soccer goalies get concussed taking shots off the dome. no one's up in arms about them wearing protection"
"in cctv footage shown to the court, shopper michael ball was minding his own business when beast ""lunged"" at him causing injuries to his arm. and a judge was told that beast leapt up at two women - frightening one so much it caused her to drop her belongings."
"i am a m ’  pounds. i had a skateboarding injury today and rolled my ankle. however, upon taking my shoe and sock off instantly, it was super swollen. ive had plenty if sprained ankles from skateboarding injuries, but this one is like really swollen. this happened  hours ago and i had it iced but i put a compression wrap on it. is this a fracture or a sprain? should i go to a hospital?"
"this all from a messily  mph. i’m not trying to lecture op or be rude but going mph on one of these is down right dangerous. please be careful, this gear would save you a lot of the damages this woman had in a mph crash, but i don’t think it would do much at mph. source: i also ride! i had in the past  suzuki gsxrs (no longer ride due to heart issues) so i switched to e scooters for a much safer thrill. now have  segway ninebot."
"that place is crazy, makes me appreciate dallas."

"just wanna pop my  cents in. here in germany the max speed on e scooters is  kph (roughly  mph) we have cobble stone roads all around us. sometimes a road will be pavement and turn into cobble stone. i was riding on my way to the zoo , and a lady hit the edge of a piece of cobblestone just right and was wearing a helmet, and flew off her scooter. all i can say is there was blood every where. i stopped to help her until paramedics arrived. she was disoriented, kept asking me what happend, asked me if she was in her scooter, where all the blood came from ect. she has a nasty concussion! a huge gash on her face. her clothing was ripped denim pants and luckily she had knee pads and elbow pads. this woman was battered! her skin in some spots where the holes were was… well it wasn’t there anymore."

"a bike on the other hand can be ridden for months or years with no falls at all. this doesn’t include mountain biking, which you will eat shit if you mtb. but just riding a road bike your likelihood of falling is small. however, when you do crash on a bike the probability you get severely injured is way higher. go over the handlebars and you will probably break a collarbone. get hit by a car and it’s over. road biking is relatively safe until it’s not and when it goes wrong it goes really wrong."
"welcome to the infinite death spiral. where before marissa was getting fancy, now she’s going to speedkill lomo as quickly as humanly possible. a single explosion (if its frags are positioned properly with telekinesis), can be used to kill lomo  times. once with the initial blast, then once more for each second he respawns, until the three second timer runs out. with her godly sense of timing, the poor fool won’t even have time to think before it’s lights out, as the deaths are so tightly timed together it’s almost as if they’re one contiguous death…"

"i have to bring my eskate with me to college and i was encouraged when i learned that you can skateboard on campus, except on the housing rules it says you can’t store any motorized vehicles! ridiculous! is there any storage available for that, or could i put it in the bike storage?"

"signed, a husk"
"i’ve been riding motorcycles for  years without any major incident.  a lot of my friends are similar.  i’ve got a handful of bad stories but they mostly weren’t being defensive riders or were just being outright asshats.   i’ve also got some scary car, skateboard, rollerblade, boat etc stories."
"""the gig is simple,"" gino said, pointing at the scooter with his thumb. ""we pad you up. you hop on and we push go. the vehicle goes and we analyze the data of the crash. there's a recovery room near the office. once you're feeling up to it, we go again. any questions?"""
"i use a swagtron swagger  commuter, and probably upgrading to an emove cruiser. $ and $ respectively, both have the required weight limit.  they both have much shorter range and lower top speed, mph and  miles is about what i get currently with my swagtron."
"i'm interested in owning an electric skateboard but, i don't know if i need to do some paperwork or not🥲"
"explicitly telling someone you’re going to kill them before attacking them (rosenbaum), hitting someone in the head with a blunt force weapon (skateboard guy), and drawing a handgun which you point at their head (grosskreutz) are all things that can get you justifiably shot. in virginia and wisconsin."

"so i was thinking of getting an electric scooter. ideally a pink one and i’m ’. i was reading how there’s been more and more explosions from e scooters. i found out it’s mostly from faulty batteries/ cheaply made scooters often from china. but even if it’s not faulty, the nature of the big battery apparently there’s always a risk of it still exploring. either you leave it plugged in too long. if you leave it completely empty on no charge. don’t expose it to heat etc. don’t damage it etc. check the battery for signs. with my paranoia, i don’t think i could handle that! i just want to ride and forget it. it’s not the same as our other electronics … don’t have to worry about it exploding. i don’t want to worry at any moment that it could just decide today is the day and explode on me. the risk seems like a huge one in my opinion. but then again i’ve never owned one. i’m wondering what other peoples opinions are like if it’s safe or not? am i overthinking ??"
thank you for coming to my ted talk lol
when i was initially doing my research another brand that stuck out was apollo. a few of those babies can go up to mph! i'm not certain how good the quality is but if you're looking for speed you should check those guys out.
"in a moment that isn’t so doom and gloom, take the scene where the skateboard kid returns the cross necklace lost at the scene of the accident. binoche laughing in the cafe is one of the great cinematic laughs in a very similar way to garbo doing the same in ninotchka for me, in it feeling very pivotal for such a closed off character to express momentary and unplanned joy and getting lost in the moment. although for a second i thought the joke she was explaining meant diarrheaing will distract the woman from the cough, but it’s actually a vomit joke. and people say arthouse movies are too remote. but the grimmest moments truly will devastate anyone with a heart. -year-old anna in the last moments of her life being the first character we meet is just brutal. and speaking of that first scene, kieslowski cannot be denied a master’s title and here’s the proof: we see julie’s husband stretch on the driver’s side so it’s established that way that the accident was truly out of julie’s hands. let the helplessness of the situation dawn. i didn’t even notice this until this last viewing."
"meanwhile i see bicyclist, scooter riders, and pedestrians acting as if there are no cars, or even other bicycles, scooters or pedestrians on the road at all."
"i hope this will inspire some of you, don’t hesitate to pm if you have any question or recommendation."
"the all-encompassing point of the movie appears to be that no man is an island, we can’t live on bread alone, all that.  julie’s decision to self-isolate is a reflex more than outstanding desire to do so. if that was the case everything would be peachy keen, but i’ve long felt anybody that responds to personal tragedy or any setback this way doesn’t really mean it when they say they no longer want the company of people. it’s more that they no longer know how to be among people, and this is a frightening thought than one that’s easy to confront. i believe the movie backs this up. it will be a slow process but julie accepting olivier finally (who does seem like a decent enough fellow to me, though i can understand if some won’t like him for the whole tracking her down maneuver), along with making peace with patrice’s mistress and forming a meaningful connection with her ostracized neighbor lucille, means she should be okay and life won’t be over for her just because her family is gone."
it does in the context of being chased down the street by a mob of people talking about how they’re going to kill you.
"you can pretty easily reach km/h on a bike, and if you crash into a pedestrian, you can do some serious damage. only vehicle i think is tolerated on the sidewalk is non electric scooters, skateboards and rollerblades. then again you can't go faster than - km/h on those vehicles anyways which won't cause much damage to pedestrians in case of a crash, then again common sense should apply, but there are too many self centered assholes everywhere."

"i believe that it’s the panic and the wanting the weight to be gone now that has led a lot of us into crash dieting and drastic measures that can’t succeed long term. i have certainly jumped into a diet craze desperate for this one to work, fallen off it the way i would fall off a skateboard, and ended up feeling worse and more hopeless each time."
"yta. keep your dog on a leash, first of all, unless you’re in an area where it’s permitted to let him off-leash. when you let him run loose, you put him and everyone else around in danger. he could run onto the road, or into the path of a bicycle/scooter/skateboard. he could knock small children over, or scare the ever-loving shit out of anyone who is afraid of dogs. he could walk over broken glass or something equally detrimental to his health, or eat something that could make him sick."
"this isn't always going to be true. some pavements are designated as shared bike/ped paths, which means bikes and (trial) scooters are allowed to travel on these paths. and the new highway code reinforces the legal position of bikes/peds(/scooters?) having right of way if you're turning into/out of a road (or car park presumably)."
"so basically, i had an incident where i landed on my leg, twisted it nearly  degrees, and tore my hamstring. i'm starting to feel good enough to skate again and attempted to last night. but i felt an incredible amount of anxiety and nausea everytime i was about to push off. anyone know techniques to rebuild confidence?"

"that one maintenance associate that seems to find you wherever you are at literally the most inopportune time, and decides to try and come down your aisle."
"so ... it turns off, and i go sailing to the blacktop, beer goes crashing down, phone skids away and i slam my entire side down from like mph."
so i started skateboarding a few weeks ago and during one of my first time trying it i broke my foot. i had lots of foot injuries in my life and i think my ankles and feet are fragile. i want to keep skateboarding but i also don’t want to break my foot. is there exercises that can help to strengthen my ankles and foot or tips to avoid injuries ?
"absolutely... i'm a biker (and still am)... sounds weird but, you have to have a first accident to ""focus the mind"" - when you're a biker you read the road far ahead.... on a skateboard x that by . ive always maintained that an electric skateboard has brakes which is way safer than hurtling down a hill on a regular board... for example."
also open to local stores to rent bikes/scooters for a day or by hour!
"most of the time, because the pedestrian/cyclist is seriously injured, even if they were at fault, they wont charge them."
"i don't believe anyone doubts protective gear works; between riding completely naked and with motogp rated leathers, airbags, helmet, boots and gloves, there will obviously be a progressive injury severity result, all other things being equal in an accident."
"i've been seeing universal remotes for sale, and wondering how they could possibly pair with all skateboards. you see i broke my verreal remote, but verreal is a small company in china. do different countries use different standards?if there is such standard, are there any notable skateboard/skateboard brands that don't follow the universal standard?"
"mr james said: “beast jumped up and put his two paws on his shoulders, causing him to fall to the floor. that is when beast was seen beginning to attack jack.”"

"i'm not a fan of scooters generally, but if you want transportation, a scooter makes a lot more sense."
"let's say my weight is  kg and i'm walking at  km/h. if i crash into someone, it will result in  j energy. run at  km/h -  j. if you accidentally bumped into standing people when you run, you know that results aren't very nice."
"i live near seattle and been needing to go there a lot recently, but don't like driving there so i take bus and get around on a my e-bike. it's small and foldable but it's still a pain to carry in on and off the bus, it hard finding places to put it when going inside different places and, it is difficult to ride up hill when the battery dies so i have to walk and push it half the time. will getting a e-scooter negate a lot of these issues?"
"i’m disabled and use a powerchair (earlier on used a manual chair/crutches) and it struck me immediately that aspects of nannying and pet care (specifically walking dogs) are difficult to do if you have injuries to your feet. if i were looking for a place to live or employment, i would always say what access requirements i need and also key things i don’t need (e.g. wheelchair access required but not a hoist - as otherwise people may assume you need more than you actually do)."
"after i hurt my back i couldn't really ride my road bike anymore. i tried a few times and it didn't really work out that well. i could kind of ride it, but then i couldn't really move much later that day or the next day and was in a ton of pain afterwards. i found a pretty cool electric bike that was affordable and rolled the dice with it. it's actually worked out really well so far. i'm more comfortable on that than in my vehicle...my issue is....everything thinks i got a dui, or  lost my license, or got it suspended or something...like everyone! i'm so sick of having to explain my situation and defend myself. i have a cdl and owned a trucking company when i hurt my back. if my body was up to it, i could go pull a set of triples or a tanker or whatever come monday morning. i still drive my car if i have to, but i try to avoid it bc its a beater work car with , miles on it and a crooked seat that's awful to sit in. i know electric bikes aren't that popular in this subreddit, but this is the main one i look at, so here i am lol. has anyone else had this kind of judgement when they ride their bike around all the time? i like going to the store or running errands, and just going anywhere with it when possible. i feel like if i'm getting this kind of judgement from family, friends, neighbors etc., i can only imagine what everyone in town thinks of the middle aged man ridding his giant electric bike around all the time lol. don't even get me started on the people that think if my back hurts so bad i shouldn't be riding a bike around. like sorry, back issues aren't a lazy person's injury. the more you move the better it's supposed to be...so they say lol. anyway...that's my rant. hopefully someone here can relate. i guess electric bikes are the new moped and everyone automatically assumes you're one your third dui if you're riding one and you're not a teenager...thanks for listening."
i’ve literally seen the imported ones that can go at km/hr among car traffic and always think to myself you’re gonna end up dead if you crash. or worse with spastic paraplegia/quadriplegia and a life not worth living.
"one night i was skateboarding home from the home of one such girl i had just finished sleeping with, randomly ran across a few girls i knew who were having a party to celebrate one of their friends from out of town about to get married.  tagged along with them to their pool, bride-to-be must have been looking for one last night with a stranger because she came onto me and i figured fuck it, i don't know her husband and hopefully i'll never see her again so we went for it while her friends were downstairs, then i continued on skateboarding home."
"that said, my situation is somewhat unique.  if you do not have tools already and can't do the maintenance yourself, it is probably more expensive than a typical car.  i can, so it saves me money, and my other option for transportation is a rather large and thirsty pickup truck.  i have friends in the trades who don't move tools and materials who have stopped driving cars and moved to everything from vespa type scooters (gas and electric, depending on need) as well as the really tiny battery powered stand up scooters similar to what are available to rent by the hour in many us cities."
“man rushed to hospital after his electric scooter collides with vehicle in downtown toronto”
"congrats, you're now a projectile in a vehicle crash and could kill someone else with your body. mandate seatbelts."
"i relate to this so much. together  years. i feel the same way, down to the not liking it and being hard to explain why. he’s just different and not the person i know. he gets really affectionate when drunk and i hate it, which to him comes across as me not being grateful of his affection. i am so turned off and i don’t want to give him affection when he’s like this. it just makes him act more affectionate and try to initiate more. i have a hard boundary of no sex while he’s drunk. he thinks he doesn’t have a problem because he’s not violent etc. however, he has done things like fall off a golf cart and ruin an expensive suit, ride and crash an electric scooter injuring his shoulder, and climb a stripper pole and land face first when letting go while upside down. he also doesn’t want me to tell him what to do. i went off on a tangent there but the fact that you are still dealing with this at  years makes me sad, i keep hoping he will realize it’s a problem and stop 😭 we’re trying couples counseling…"
i think that was the camera man at : saying “i missed it dawg”.
"my point is that any lane position is going to be fine when the speed is low and traffic is stopped. contrary to many on this sub, i actually prefer filtering on the far right, because it keeps me more out of sight of any potential law enforcement that might be lurking. as a moped driver, cars are way more tolerant about a moped filtering up on the right rather than between two lanes. i will occasionally filter in the middle, but i find the use of the shoulder to be of the same quality of safety as traditional lane-splitting."
"kph+ crash with no protection be it scooter, bike or skateboard and you are in with a good chance of ending up in the ""forever box""."
"in conclusion, this project was awesome. i love my pint more than ever. working on this taught me so much and i highly recommend to try it yourself if, like me, you are an electronic enthusiast."
"your cringe take is fair. i spent nearly  years from - give or take, skateboarding around downtown kingston. bombing hills, dropping large stair set etc. all of which was extremely dangerous, most of my friends broke multiple bones and had lots of hospital visits. i never got much more than a bruise though. through my -s i also had several friends get arrested for drunk driving and or get into bad accidents. i only had one accident, i was at a stand-still in a merge lane when a bus clipped me. my life is awesome. in reply to your last comment, my electric skateboard is neither an e-bike, nor a scooter. in the city of toronto, i've done extensive research and as far as i've been able to tell, it is a skateboard. skateboards must be used on city sidewalks, unless crossing a street at an intersection. however in the past  years i've blasted past so many police cars that never even batted an eye or looked my way. so, even if you were correct about my board being illegal, i'd still ride it every day bc just like jay-walking, they don't give a crap about it."

"hey all,a very close friend was run off the rode near the napili fire station on the honoapiilani hwy on saturday july th. he was riding a scooter and a phantom vehicle ran into his lane, causing him to crash and suffer extensive injuries.his uninsured motorist policy isn’t likely to pay unless there was a witness to the accident.by chance did anyone witness this? you would be doing him a massive favor as he is out of work currently due to the injury.thanks everyone!"
"arc updated their policy a while ago so that you can't bring electric scooters into the arc anymore, was wondering if that policy applies to all queen's buildings or not. i intend to just bring my scooter into auditoriums or labs for the coming year, was wondering if that's allowed or not.thanks in advance"
"yes, we are. most home insurance policies cover third party liability claims made against the policy holder or their family members who reside in the home."
"i agree, this will cause a decrease in ridership for sure."
"i have been a bicyclist for + years and scooter rider for + years. i've ridden on city streets, amongst traffic, in all weather conditions. i don't wear any protective gear or a helmet. nearly , miles on electric scooters, and countless (definitely in excess of , miles) on my bicycle. no serious accidents of any kind. in fact, only one slip and fall on the scooter (learned not to have solid tires) and one very minor accident on my bike. two minor incidents in + years."
"not a school question just a question for myself but don't really know how to solve it because i didn't take a single physics class in my life yet.supposedly you are on an electric scooter going . km per hour. the scooter is . kg and you weigh kg. if you were riding and suddenly hit a bad bump and were sent flying forward, how far would you fall forward? is there other information needed to solve this? if so what is it?\~much appreciated"
"fresh out of highschool,  year old making good (for a college student) money, i got myself a  jetta tdi from a delearship in the shady part of town (known to sell lemons, and just general used carsalesman type of practices) that particular dealership had nicer vehicles and had a nice new office built, but that was a sham. so first weekend driving the car the transmission broke down so the dealer had it replaced, car worked great after that but a few weeks later i gave my friend a ride after he dropped his bike off at a shop to get his seat reupholstered, and we were on the spaghetti bowl on one of the loops and i heard a weird noise and i kept hitting the break to slow down to turn and not hit the loops barricade but nothing. so we hit a barricade going  mph, somehow flew up in the air did a few barrel rolls, landed up right facing traffic and survived. thankfully everyone that was near us quickly stopped and helped us out of the totaled vehicle and no other car was hit and me and my friend were fine. i thought i only sprained my ankle because it hurt to out weight on it, but the next day i couldn’t walk and both my feet were swollen and purple. so i crawled to the bathroom washed myself, then called my parents to pick me up, had to crawl downstairs lay on a skateboard and used it to help me get to the vehicle, went to the er and waited like  hours to get a bed and get xrays. they originally told me i fractured my ankle, and were going to cast me up and release me and get me crutches but i was like the other foot hurts more than the break how am i suppose to bear weight in it with crutches? so this brand new ortho intern came in and wanted to take a second look and diagnosed a lisfranc injury on the left foot and took a look at the xrays on the other leg and saw that the fracture would need a plate because if it wasn’t reinforced there would be a chance that it could break again the bone could slice a major artery right next to it. so i was in surgery a few hours later, one plate for the lisfranc injury and one plate for the broken ankle. i had to go to the university in a borrowed electric wheelchair that stunk like cigarettes in lil shorts and exposed toes. embarassing. worst period of my life hands down. worst part is volkswagen was doing the diesel vehicle buyback and they offered me $k for that car i paid $k for, and i was  weeks away from finishing up the semester and was planning on not driving that car until they told me to take it to the dealership… i forgot to state the transmission work was shoddy and it basically fell apart on the loop and fucked up the brakes and thats what caused the accident."
"i ride a onewheel around.  i try to be extra courteous and slow down around anyone walking on the sidewalk.  i actually usually go in the grass to give them more space and i like riding there occasionally anyway.recently i had a bro on an electric bike wiz past me going legit -mph on the sidewalk.  did not slow down to pass narrow gap.  also, lots of those electric scooters around everywhere now (rental ones).  kids sometimes riding them on busy streets, already heard of a few deaths near me.  no helmets with rentals.i love my onewheel, and feel it’s a privilege to ride around on sidewalks and as suggested, i want to make sure others feel safe as well since it is something with a motor & people are often unfamiliar (don’t know i can stop faster than bikes).  i am afraid that the new prevalence of electric scooters and bikes, and people being unsafe, will soon have to crack down more and make it so i can’t ride the paths and trails i do.  anyone else?"
"ted: okay okay. look, the point is you can’t sell that helmet, it’s damaged. once its been in an accident the foam gets compressed and it's not safe anymore."
"i'm saving minimum $ a month in gas, we're ordering my wife a model y and paying for most of the monthly payment with gas savings, that's nothing to sneeze at."
"there are different kinds of scooter controls.  some twist, some are levers, like you said, but others still have a bar that passes through the control column, so when yoh have it parallel to the handlebar it stops, when it is closer on the right, it   goes forwards, and when it is closer on the left, it goes backwards. that way rather than having a spring, the only resistance is pressure you apply with your other hand.  many targets have scooters with this control scheme you could try out."
"lane miles of new protected bus-only lanes, so every new yorker lives within a quarter mile of a protected bus lane;"
"i took a spill  on an electric scooter (with a helmet on thankfully) and i was crazy sore the next day. my only apparent injury was a bruised, scraped knee, but i felt sore for days."
"long story long, i'd say years of screwing up my body, and then one pretty bad car accident will definitely cause  bulging discs in ones spine. back issues are no fun. it's definitely worth it to go to the dr if you're having pain that last more than a week. especially if the pain never lets up, in which case i wouldn't even wait a week to see a professional."
hypomania for me is getting a really stupid new hobby i would never do before like skateboarding and then hurting myself and being embarrassed and tossing the skateboard lol. spending crazy money on gifts for people or really random crap. everything is powered by this high energy and i barely eat. i get this feeling like bugs crawling under my skin in my arms and my brain will be buzzing with the same thoughts on loop or lots of music or ideas like my mind would be so busy and never quiet. i talk very fast too and sometimes get all my words mixed up because my brain is being faster than my mouth and i walk too fast for everyone. then i crash hard into depression when it's over.
"no buddha souvenirs in thailand - they take their religion very seriously and you will get grief. you can also end up in jail for failing to show respect to the king, which includes things like stepping on a piece of paper money to stop it from blowing down the street (his picture's on it)."
bucks for a belt driven skateboard that can go  km/h and has a range of up to  kmfor the people that don’t know much about electric skateboards this is a good price
"took the elevator, walked out the other side of the emergency room and started walking casually and a security guard told me to stop and that your committing a crime, but it was some old man, who was the only guard around at that time especially since it was like am all ready."
the city’s jail boss revved up the feds’ frustration with conditions at rikers island by missing a meeting with the manhattan u.s. attorney’s office and going to a car show.
"son was stupid enough to ride his motorized scooter middle of the street, and father was also stupid enough to give this kind of toy to child. favara was innocent, this accident occurs because of stupidity of father and son. favara was in wrong neighbourhood."
i won't preach... i will just let others do it ;)
"""in nice, a little ukrainian kid got killed in a shock with an electric scooter. the little boy, aged , was crossing the promenade des anglais in nice with his mother at a pedestrian crossing on wednesday when the accident took place."""
"i'm not disputing that the scooter shouldn't legally have been there, but that's a criminal matter. the fact that it shouldn't have been doesn't change the fact that it was"

"it does not matter if it is electric, hydrogen or or made of gold. it takes up way too much space for the people it serves."
bring a soccer ball/skateboard/something else to get moving and play with during breaks
"a motorcycle isn’t always the best transportation solution. however i come from the world of cycling, over there i was bombing hills and burning bridges at -mph in essentially tissue paper for clothing and tires the width of skateboard wheels. the gear i wear on my moto is exponentially improving my margin of safety in comparison. i understand my regular pants and shoes wont hold up in a moto crash but that’s the risk i take with “most of the gear most of the time”."
"ok so i commented this in the post-game thread on the main subreddit, but i feel it belongs here.i had a skateboarding crash in my mid s where i landed on the part where the palm meets the wrist. it hurt like hell for weeks, and for around  months it would hurt when i moved it certain ways.i think we are being lied to by the padres about the severity of this injury. i think tatis will be out for the year. i think even if he came back this season the wrist would be easily aggravated and force him out.i think even if he came back % our team has too many flaws outside his absence."
my only tip is don’t go in the toy story (dca) queue with the scooter if you can avoid it.
"in a slightly more awkward story i was out with some friends in high school, guy friend was driving, i'm riding passenger, back seat was a girl and a younger kid we all knew from my neighborhood.  i think we might have been drinking at some point because i don't really remember the details of how things got like this, maybe some kind of truth or dare situation, but as some point she climbs forward from the back seat and basically starts trying to give the driver road head. while she's doing that reaches over and starts giving me a handy, and our friend in the back seat was just losing his mind as this was way outside the level of things he was used to."
"i am considering purchasing an electric scooter for my last mile commute from the train station to my work. i am currently walking or taking the shuttle, but would like the convenience and quickness of an e-scooter.i would like one that is foldable and lightweight. it does not need to reach very high speeds, but should be able to handle small inclines well. my path to work is fairly flat, but there is one small hill to climb. in total, i would be riding the scooter about . miles a day for - days a week.not having anywhere to test drive a scooter before purchase makes me anxious, so any recommendations would be appreciated! my budget is <$, but would prefer <$. thank you!"
"so i ask, when considering there are some serious pros and cons, why must you think bicyclists are bad when they can turn into car or pedestrian when it's convenient? besides just being upset that they have some pros to outweigh the cons and you are jealous, what actual logical reason is there to be upset about that?"

"always with a smile and always up for chat when i’d see him, he would regularly send me radio industry news.   i always hoped he’d take me up on the offer to do a shift here and there on btr but he had moved on from radio and was happy."
"""investigators were “unable to locate any damages (dents, scuffs, scratches, etc. or any other physical evidence (clothing fibers, fingerprints, areas of skin oils transfer to the vehicle surface, etc. (sic) to either vehicle that indicated a collision occurred or a body rolled across the surface of the hood,” the report said."""
"start driving very early, ideally before sunrise (unless you’re not a morning person and this would kill you) for me this makes a long day in the car feel more natural"
will dustin's leg be the same next season? what about steve's bites? will these impact our characters next season?
"question : how do i pick a spot to ride? do i need to take into account the grade of the road? do i need to scout it out for cracks and shit? do i need to have an end spot planned that will have me slowing down on an uphill or something? there is a small mountain that my college is basically built on that i'm thinking would be fun to ride on, but i don't know if it's a good/safe place to ride/learn."
"in all seriousness, when you choose to disobey leash laws, you have the potential to cause a great deal of harm and you ruin the enjoyment of public spaces for a large number of dogs and people alike. furthermore, ask any local dog trainer if the majority of off-leash dogs they see have a reliable, distraction proofed recall or are exhibiting safe or socially appropriate behavior. the answer is a resounding and overwhelming no. it’s often a no even in off-leash designated areas but that’s another topic."
"duck! i've gotta admit, i'd still be remembering that one with embarrassment if i'd done that. not a huge deal, though."
"it's like a skateboarding place. so it's safer that there are no people in that space. if there are too many people, they will crash into the skateboard."
i've heard many places in the eu had horrible access problems... like no curb cuts on sidewalks.. and no handicap accessible motels... making it difficult for travelers.  do you think that's true?
"i also know a guy that used to ride one of those electric skateboards that you power via a handheld remote. i think it went up to like -km/h at top speed. when he first showed it to me i asked him if he'd ever heard of the law of conservation of momentum. he told me it's no big deal and the thing had brakes. i asked him about it recently, apparently he doesn't ride that skateboard anymore. i wonder what might have happened..."
just legalise pevs in a smart way. none of the max power nonsense (upto a limit. like kw sustained) then just implement speed limits.
"since you ride an esk i'm sure you already have gear, but incase you don't you also need to realize the sherman is essentially / a motorcycle with the speeds it can reach. you'll definitely want some chest armor, kneepads, an ece rated motorcycle helmet, etc."
"why all of your options are sus wheels if you plan to ride on smooth roads? also, there is way more maintenance on scooters, simply more moving parts, yet the same drawbacks and pros of being electric anyway. suspension on euc is really a preference and or enduro offroad feature, not a must like with scooters and bikes. it's also a little better to learn on non-sus wheels, it will develop all the right riding skills. you really need to know how to react to a bump even on sus wheels because if it ever bottoms out you just won't know what to do and crash at high speed."
"so when the job market tanked and i lost my cushy marketing job at [insert one of countless start ups here], being immortal didn't really help."
"do you mean a mountain biking helmet? it does sound somewhat unpleasant. also, bike helmets are designed to take one high speed crash while skateboard helmets are designed to take multiple slower speed hits."
that's sort of the precursor to the hip hop/punk/metal style that ratm is known for. urban dance squad was in there first though.
he probably got into a fight or is just another skateboard injury lol
"yeah, i’ll definitely try, but it’s not likely that i’ll be seen tbh. when my knee busted in  nobody would even see me in person at the health centre that i am a registered patient at due to covid, and i was told on the phone to just take celebrex. i even went to civic ed and was told to come back if my knee was locked because then it’s an emergency. my knee was locked right then and there and the md sent me home with a small piece of paper for a physiotherapist lol."
marketing first.  the companies that have done well on the 'fun' side of pevs have really pushed the marketing.

change of clothes (day or gym (depending on which i wear to go i would carry the other))
"i've always worn a helmet, a habit from cycling. i've only ever hit my head once, in my years on a bike or scooter or skateboard, when i had to bail out on an incline i wasn't ready to take on my board. no injury, and i walked it off just fine, but that was enough to remind of just why i wear it. don't let anyone tell you that helmets aren't cool. ending up in the hospital with a head injury is way less cool."
"this model is meant to be attached on the existing holes of the board,  holes where the original fender is screwed on, plus  holes where the pads are screwed on. the fender only goes over the pads by  cm, not taking too much space for your feet."
"for the recent espanyol and benfica home games, barca have used the nh constanza, a chain more popular with business travellers (and journalists on a budget, the athletic knows well). this was another message in itself for the players — no more lenience, no more pampering. it was now about the bare essentials, working hard and earning every crumb. those who do not like this idea, or still want an easy ride, will be told to get off."
"last may i was going about mph and this young adult on an electric long board was passing me (did not say a word....) and then he fell.... into my line of travel, and he caused me a major crash. we both walked away fine, and we were lucky a witness saw us and that we did not get high by cars."
"a young guy lost his life, that’s unfortunate.  how about we actually talk about something this guy did?  i don’t know who this guy was and all this thread taught me was motorcycle motorcycle motorcycle danger."
spin expects their scooters to start hitting the streets on monday.

"sex lab. would have been mortifying for op, but it was cleared up before it ever became so.  it's only a boring kind of mortifying to the hearer."
"at this point, i decided to look for solutions to increase the range of my onewheel:"
tech skeptics (usually on the non-mainstream left) love characterizing legal arbitrage as if there are no good faith actors and it's just a pack of thieves and useful idiots. it's a problem because then they just perpetuate a status quo that everyone agrees is unacceptable.
apart from the violence….i hate to say it but maybe having to scan a drivers license or permit and it having to match the card somehow? i don’t like having to put more info into companies hands and people not being able to buy their friends the scooter time but i’ve seen enough teenagers being straight up stupid and reckless (also drunk fucks) and me ending up in court/prison/debt/mental torment for hitting one of those snot heads isn’t something i want to deal with.
"red can’t use her stand to draw on gelified objects for fuel, as winona’s sheet states, these are semi-solids, not liquids."
"the arrest part is obsolete. i stated how i would stay to ensure the safety of the people, which considering your concerns stated throughout about a young child or elderly person being mutilated by this kg death trap, should be sufficient."
what has your doctor said? if they said stay off of it and rest stay the fuck off of it and rest.
"so say im riding an electric scooter, the kind you get your kids. im talking like a razor e, w power, mph limit, etc. how might my insurance get affected if i were to cause an accident or be a victim of an accident?"
"i’m cm (’”) and weigh around kg (lbs). i was looking into buying my first electric skateboard but i saw there’s a drastic decrease in range with these boards with just a few kilograms of difference. so is it worth it to get an electric skateboard with my weight, or would the decrease in range or other capabilities of the board be too much to warrant this purchase?edit: that’s my weight without any gear. additionally: i was looking into backfire boards.edit : thank you so much to everyone for your great advice and recommendations but my budget is around € which i know is relatively inexpensive for an electric skateboard but i wanted to go easy for my first e skateboard and additionally right now i don't have the funds for much more."
"aaaanyway, how is this relevant to metapets?"
"i currently use a non-electric kick scooter to get to my subway station  mile away.  it makes my commute (plus two subway stops from manhattan to queens) about  minutes, vs - minutes if i were to to take an additional subway & transfer."
"in the days leading up to the lad's death, cardiff crown court heard that there was four other incidents involving beast - whose owner ""knew"" about its behaviour problems. you can see full updates from the sentencing hearing here."
🤨“spoiler alert: i can see you. if you come to the google offices downtown you’ll be safe.”
"does anyone else feel like if the skateboard twins had just taken that job at davis and main, that mike would have never crashed into kim’s car, which caused gus to alter those mesa verde numbers and ultimately allowed kim and jimmy to break up, birthing saul goodman.what are some other unpopular opinions on the genesis of saul goodman?"
imo the bigger change will be flat floors as they can cut the transmission/driveshaft tunnel and just put the passenger compartment on top of the skateboard and have hub engine.

"tl;dr: i dont think the problem is that we arent telling people to wear gear enough. we definitely are. the main problem (imo) is that people underestimate how dangerous it is to be ejected off of a skateboard at ~ mph. they think a helmet is fine, because they dont realize just how dangerous a fall can be. we need to educate new riders on not only the importance of gear but also the true dangers of a fall."
"“did you feel that sam? that was incredible. looks like a lot of damage,” she said."
"thanks for reading this.  i’ll try and keep it short.  i’ll have to leave out some things.i have been on tons of antibiotics in my life. from the age of at least  until  my mother would give me antibiotics every time i got a cold or flu which was often.  i would get sinus and bronchial infections so the doctor would give antibiotics and then even when i was just having a bug my mother would demand antibiotics until he just complied.  she also would keep leftovers or some  of her own prescriptions and just treat me with those.  i also went from being pretty bright and able to focus to being a problem child and having periods of just feeling strange.  i’ll get back to that in a bit.then at age  i had a skateboarding injury that left me with an infected hip that turned into cellulitis and i was put on intravenous antibiotics and then a long corse of oral. shortly afterward i never felt the same again and endless health issues began.  i’m a  year old male.  i started to just feel out of it and not like myself.  no energy.  depressed.  a little like when i said i’d have periods of feeling strange as a child.  i started having terrible insomnia.  brain fog just kept getting worse to the point of depersonalization that has never gone away.  still have it.at  i got my first toothache and had my first root canal.  in about a week from then i had a pericarditis and was put on more intravenous antibiotics at the hospital.  i never thought to say i had a root canal and they thought i was having an autoimmune problem.  they started me on prednisone and imuran and was referred to stanford immunology clinic. i was on theses and other meds for around  years.  i just kept feeling worse and started having pustules all over my beard area and cystic acne, even on my butt which they gave me……..even more antibiotics  for.  just got worse.i left them eventually and found another doc who took me off everything and put me just on compounded dhea as mine was nonexistent due to prednisone.started feeling i bit better after awhile but never well.   i luckily never needed more antibiotics until around age  and i broke out in red dots all over.  a dermatologist figured it was fungal and gave me like  weeks of diflucan.  it cleared up and in around  months i was feeling the best i had since this all began.  it only lasted for maybe a couple of years.  since then my brain fog has worsened and now i am very dizzy feeling. this year has been hell.  i can’t stress how bad my cognition is.  i can’t follow tv or simple conversations.  i can’t think  a step ahead and forget everything.  and my head physically feels bizarre.  nonstop headache and strained eye feeling.  it is utter hell.  there is tons of sediment in my urine and it sometimes looks like thick soup.  i found this when i had to pee in a glass because bathroom was occupied.i have had an upper gi endoscopy, a colonoscopy, brain mri and ct, ultrasound of entire abdomen,   urinalysis, tons of blood work and an ultrasound of an enlarged parotid gland.the only thing that comes back is a small cyst in parotid gland, scattered liver cysts and a para pelvic cyst.  they say all are benign and nothing to worry about.i suspect that the cysts are fungal and caused by years of crazy amounts of antibiotics combined with the prednisone and imuran as well as bad diet.  my esophagus and colon showed no yeast growth.  i never have thrush or nail fungus.  candida diet does not help.  only relief i’ve felt came from the diflucan years ago and only temporary.i’ve made an appointment at the mayo clinic on august th.  i’m hoping they might be able to figure this out or in the least try me on some more diflucan as my doc has been unwilling.there is much more i can add, especially about how crappy i feel, but i’ll have to end this here.  any thoughts would be so appreciated. thanks 🙏"

"even a fall just standing is enough to kill you. doesn't matter how good you think you are you will crash eventually. not even a question of skill or awareness theres always factors outside of your control that can unexpectedly send you flying. someone might unexpectedly jump in front of you, a dog might run up to you, a random pebble or crack can give you speed wobbles, a sudden gust of wind can knock you off, you could get hit by a random frisbee, a large bug could suddenly fly into your eye, your board can slip on a surface with a bit of sand on it, etc. also good luck trying to bail at + mph. you'll be sliding on the concrete before you can even react. even if you can react there's not much you can do force multiplies exponentially with speed. whatever little bailing techniques you learned on a skateboard won't exactly transfer over so well at these speeds. from the sounds of it doesn't seem like you've gone on many group rides but i've heard plenty of horror stories from people i've met. i know i guy that even lost his fucking right arm dude. he also shattered his jaw in several spots and broke the tip of his stump in different crashes (jaw was from eskate stump was on a euc)"
"not necessarily. if you were in that situation you’d probably be the subject of a media character assassination campaign, rightfully acquitted, and then have idiots who didn’t pay attention to any of the trial information insist that you’re still guilty because they refuse to hear anything that doesn’t agree with their pre-trial conclusion of you."
both of these two are at fault but boy is that car driver distracted.
"electric skateboards are not legal at all! (surprised me too, i was under the impression that the  nys law that legalized e-bikes and stand-up escooters too covered lots of micromobility devices, but no. stand-up escooters are good, but legal devices have to have handlebars (seat or no seat is okay). no electric skateboards, no onewheels, no nmotion vs, etc., etc.)"
"i have never slowed down since my teen years, and i'm going to keep going until i can't anymore."
"what if red uses a bleeding body as an “open liquid container” to draw fuel from us?: not good, seeing as it fuels her while also making us bleed out quicker. but we’ve got a solution! winona already has a healing stand and can easily close up wounds on herself or ravee, though ravee will be more vulnerable because she isn’t guaranteed to always be close to winona."
"everything started when my girlfriend bought herself an electric scooter. we wanted to go on long rides and cruise around the hilly san francisco together. as a pint rider, you can imagine that competing with her miles range didn’t go so well for me. - miles into the ride, we had to turn around or keep going to the  miles deadly limit and pay for an uber / lyft back."

"literally anyone semi-serious about road biking out for a casual ride down a mountain or to get some kom. it's surprisingly easy to get up to -kph on a road bike, kph on a hill like this and even lesser ones isn't unimaginable."
"while it's easy to laugh, in reality it's very hard to escape the way you were raised, and americans are (sadly) raised in a culture of fear - not to mention a substantially higher violent crime rate. as a parent i can't imagine what it must be like sending your children to school knowing there is a low but real chance that a disgruntled individual could take an assault rifle and shoot up the school."
"but immortality doesn't erase your student loans. your landlord doesn't care that if you were to cut off your own arm, it would grow back like a gecko's severed tail. the economy, the mysterious and unpredictable force more fickle than any magical spell, wasn't interested in your timelessness--unless you were old enough to have seen and learned the patterns of commerce. and i wasn't."
"i swear i've seen more and more of these in the last few months. small electric scooters, not road legal being driven by people clearly without any knowledge of the road, on the road. i've seen kids riding them as well as adults near me. are these getting more popular all over the uk?how are more people not getting killed, because they look like death traps?"

"the thing i am trying to figure out is if this aer bag fits with what i need. also, i am wondering if this bag would be available for purchase in person where i am as i am located in canada and canada has god-awful import tax rules that do me over every time. if i order this bag on their site it will be no exception. aer's website claims that nordstrom carries the bag but neither have i ever seen it in person nor seen it on their canadian site. it is on the us nordstrom site tho."
"scooters are way quicker, and they're electric. if you get something with proper wattage (w+), it will haul ass up the big hills here. whereas on a bike you would have to expend decent energy. however, a bike would actually allow you to get some exercise while you're commuting. also, like the other commenter said, if you have back to back classes, i guarantee you'll be on time with a scooter, whereas a bike you would have to unlock, ride to class (less manoeuvrability in dense crowds, especially around the sather gate area) then find a place to lock it again. it's gonna be a pain in the ass."
"i was going maybe - mph on a side road. i was planning on making a right turn, but then i noticed a ditch of sand on the right. i instinctively leaned left to avoid it, but the scooter tipped over and i went on a concrete slip n slide for about a good  feet and dislocated my shoulder. just woke up from the anesthesia and everything was put back successfully. moral of the story be super careful on the road!"
that's like asking if you are going to crash your car someday.
"we don’t have a pit, but their dog who is huge loves to suddenly take off running at other people or dogs- never attacks but thinks it’s fun to run full tilt at them barking like a maniac and then stop  feet away to wag their tail. and my parents are like “oh he won’t hurt you!” while they chase him laughing, and i’m thinking that if a huge dog came running at me i will fucking kick it and its irresponsible as hell to let dogs who do that off their leash."

"the result is incredible and beats my expectations. the fender adds about  pounds to the board, but i can ride what seems like forever compared to what i was used to. technically speaking, i haven’t managed to discharge the battery completely, riding for more than  hours is a leg killer and i need to stop. the most i’ve managed to do was  miles with % battery left, according to the onewheel app. not only the range improvement, a noticeable change is how the board handles uphills now, having extra capacity provides  major improvements:"

"in canicross, which is probably the most similar, we do not generally run the dogs on hard surfaces due to the issues above. they are generally kept on dirt trails providing more cushioned running."
"the admittedly pretty rough statistics for injury/fatality can be halved by wearing a helmet, halved once more by riding sober, again by being under  and then reduced even more by wearing armour and riding defensively."

"highway  is dangerously boring. i absolutely avoid it as much as i can because it’s flat, straight, and crowded. feels like it’s putting me to sleep after an hour or two."
"i've had one accident very nearly happen, where a small boy on qn electric scooter came from behind a spruce fence to the cross walk right in front of my car. luckily i am not an -year old and i was driving under the speed limit and could stop the car in time. with your change to the law, if i had hit him, it would have been my fault."
"you would have no expectation of a vehicle travelling at speed on a footpath, neither would any reasonable person, the accident is almost certainly down to the scooter operator . i would take the view that you owe him nothing, and if he wants to pursue it, ask him to report the incident to police at which point he's admitting operating a motor vehicle on the pavement without license, mot or insurance."
"senior dogs and dogs who are injured or ill. medically fragile dogs still want to enjoy the outdoors too and their humans are often already under the emotional strain of injury/illness recovery or end of life care for a beloved pet. maybe the dog is just a grumpy, arthritic senior. they have likely chosen a designated on-leash area for a reason. they deserve to walk safely and in peace as do all dogs."
"children experience a greater rate of fractures and polytrauma from e-scooters compared to adults, but fewer facial injuries despite a similar rate of head trauma. the incidence of pediatric head injuries indicates a lack of helmet use similar to adults. lawmakers should consider bolstering e-scooter regulations to decrease pediatric injuries."

"nerve pain is a b!tch, but you can push through it and with time it gets better for most. first  years mine was / and no medications were helping and i did my best to stop taking any pills post rehab. i still have numbness in my feet and feel general discomfort but i've accepted that this is the new normal now. first  months i couldn't brush my teeth or feed myself. for  years my mom had to move in with me because my strength didn't come back to me as quickly as it usually happens for other people. within first  days of my injury i've lost  pounds of muscle weight, i was so pissed, i used to work out at least  times a week for years and it was all gone within  days!"
"if marissa somehow crash lands? rather than try to come to a safe halt she’ll embrace it, using explosions to align her vectors to shoot straight up (blasting a hole in the roof if need be). as she reaches the top of her trajectory, where the net forces acting on her are zero, she’ll form platforms of frags from various explosions to safely walk down."

the wife.  the boss was clearly not mortified. this is op being weirdly mortified for another person who... get this... has a sense of humor about their minor error.
"that said, in some cases you could get away with an ebike, but i'd argue depending on your situation they may not be capable enough. being able to substitute cars will depend a lot on your infrastructure, they'll be fine if you have robust bike lanes, but if you're forced to keep up with traffic it won't cut it, and imo even a cc scooter would still be a little underpowered, i'd rather get a -cc one so speed is not an issue. plus they're much quieter than those cc  stroke scooters."
anthrax really liked pe. so much so that they collaborated on bring the noise.
"op also wasn't clear about the scooter being operated outside of the trial schemes: even though it sounds like the rider was in possession of the scooter, it may be one of the perfectly legal long term voi rentals for example. though it sounds more likely it was an illegally operated scooter, so i'd be interested to know if that changes things."
"it's the rental scooters that are the problem. most private scooter owners know how to ride one and don't particularly want to crash as they don't want to get injured and fix/replace their scooter. i say most as like any form of transport, there are always a few morons ruining it for everyone."
"his uncle was driving a scooter (like a moped) at night, going back home from work. he saw a lady, who gestured for a lift. he stopped besides her and asked her. she told him that she needed lift till her neighbourhood. he agreed since he just wanted to help a lady out in need. after some distance, she asked him to drop her. he wished her goodnight, and went on his way. after some distance, he spotted another lady asking for a lift. that lady was also wearing a sari (traditional drape), but he couldn't recognise her face. she told him the same thing, and he helped ""another"" person. again, he wished her goodnight, and went on his way. while driving away, he had a cold shiver running down his spine. the realisation was starting to dawn over him, but hadn't quite yet."
i'd also recommend something with a top speed well over what your intended road speeds are. these would require an m-class license.

"you know what you should do, get both off amazon and return the one you don't like. but whatever you do, please make sure you have a proper bike light installed. most scooter lights are worthless, and you're bound to crash due to the potholes here at berkeley."
"yes, i think it's important to be safe. some of the most important steps to being safe are; () learn the terrain you will be riding. () know how to properly handle your scooter."

"rewind to a few months, maybe a year ago when i was riding a skateboard at full speed and hit a pebble. was thrown off and slammed into the ground. slid across asphalt and did a number on my skin, but my bones did not fail.&#xb;would have posted earlier and included images if i knew this sub existed at the time, very unfortunate i only found this place now."
"weightlifting is far more straightforward, especially with the newer, purpose built isolation machines that only move in one axis/rotation so that you basically cant fuck up the form. the advantage there is true isolation...if you need to strengthen your left minor oblong inner posterior glute longhead, theres probably some machine just for that. great for body builders trying to sculpt."

edit: the lawyer quoted in this article seems to think drivers hitting e-scooters will be held responsible by default - much like for hitting other more vulnerable road users.
"i  have observed that electric skateboards and smaller push scooters cost  just as much as a full blown electric moped. the full blown electric  mopeds have substantially higher range, bigger batteries, similar power,  and require more material to build. they still cost comparatively  lesser than electric long-boards/mountain-boards or push scooters.why  is this so? the electric long-boards also have substantially lesser  moving parts, smaller range, and fewer required materials. is it the  economies of scale that make these products nonviable?"
"i appreciate you trying to stick up for my parents and make me see things in a different light but i'm afraid that isn't the case in my household.there are different ways to make sure your kid turns out a good person- what goes on in my house, is not one of them."
a fiction book i read around . it has a brown cover with the main character on it. i think he was skateboarding. protagonist gets into a skateboarding accident on a bridge and dies. makes a deal with the judges of death to give him a second chance to finally seal the deal with his crush. he has a limited amount of time to do so. over time his injuries begin to get more sever and decomposition begins to set in. that is the most i can remember. please help!
here's old suicidal tendencies when they were punk.
"but really you should wear a helmet on a bike, ebike, skateboard, eboard, etc. all it takes is one bad hit and speed isn't the only factor. just wear the fucking helmet people."
when you have the infrastructure it just makes sense. i get to work as fast as if i was on my motorbike. i pollute less and it gives a bit of excercise.
"stop whenever you want: don’t feel like you need to keep driving, stop whenever you wanna take a break or look at something or stretch your legs. again, it makes the drive feel more natural instead of something you have to do. have some fun with it"
"as the pair quickly drive by the pit stop, ravee will use her free hands to grab onto any loose objects on the benches: car hubcaps and water bottles are prioritized, but if ravee can carry it, she’ll grab it. after grabbing what they can, the two will turn their sights back onto the track, where the rest of their plan will take place. provided red isn’t running towards them with reckless abandon, they take refuge behind a car for a few seconds. with this brief moment of pause, winona gels several of the hubcaps she’d taken and forms them into a board-like shape; a hubcap skateboard, if you will. while in the initial stages of the fight ravee will use this board primarily to escape and keep safe from red, later on it will serve as a mobility tool."
"…after all, it's time for the main course."
i ran a kitchen for about  years. i've been through a lot of this stuff you're talking about.

i feel like i get pulled to both extremes.
"his wife grabbed the open door, but lost the tug-of-war with the suv and fell under its back wheels. she was rushed to nyu-langone hospital-brooklyn, where she remained in critical condition saturday.ten miles away, at : p.m. friday, -year-old tyson anderson was injured when a mister softee truck struck him as he bicycled along hendrix st. at sutter ave. in east new york.tyson was reported in critical condition at brookdale university hospital medical center.the mister softee truck’s driver, juan rimigio, , remained at the scene of the crash and was arrested for driving on a suspended license and other charges."
similar to this. i’ve nearly taken out a kid on electric scooter a few times over the previous weeks.

"tell me i'm pulling it out of my ass, you know i'm right"
"keep in mind, the prices for tools and consumables fluctuate with the market. sometimes wildly, like right now. there should be a drop in prices at some point, but we can never know just where it will end up at any given time."
"my solution was a motorcycle.  i'm a construction worker, and i do own a truck that i use for renovations on my own property as well as hauling materials and tools when i have to.  that said, i went from  mpg to about  and i'm saving $- a day on parking because of reduced rates for bikes and scooters.  in some areas i can even park for free at bicycle racks.  (pro tip, put a cover on your bike and everyone assumes it's an electric scooter and leaves it alone even if it isn't technically allowed.)"
"when you start to learn, the skills and muscle memory you need to develop are as follows:"

"don't do it!!!!   read all the trustpilot reviews of people not getting their boards or their money back.  endless problems.  if you are not in china to have some leverage, don't deal with this company."
"this might go against the grain here, but you probably shouldn't rent a scooter. yes, you don't need a license to get on one, i'm on koh phangan currently and have been riding around a good portion of the island. i handed in the key and said no more today after a near miss yesterday. despite what anyone might tell you, they just aren't safe because if something does go wrong you'll regret ever hopping on."

"i crashed at mph wearing full moto gear except riding pants on an electric unicycle. i was alright but banged up and ripped my jeans. couldn't imagine doing this at mph on a god damn scooter with only a helmet and skateboard pads, you'd fucking die. you need armored gloves, jacket with pad inserts, sturdy boot with ankle protection, and probably kevlar pants. i hope the helmet is snell rated."

literally anything that could eat away at electricity would be worth doing. crypto mining (despite the recent crash) is the first thing i can think of that you could start making a profit on relatively quickly.

guys i just slammed my head and arm on the concrete today not even trying to do any tricks or anything. i was literally just trying to avoid running into these people on the sidewalk and ended up accidentally getting my right wheels off the curb which caused me to fall. the left side of my head bounced off the concrete like it was a basketball. it ripped a hole in my shirt and i can't move my arm without pain now. i'm pretty sure i dislocated my elbow and there's a lump on the side of my head. falling off a curb..... definitely not the coolest way to get injured skateboarding 😂update: my elbow is fractured big oof !!
"let's compare this situation to something else: driving. firstly let's consider the situation where driver is drunk (illegal) and that leads him to crashing into a pedestrian. this pedestrian now has a kidney failure and it's going to die unless you give them your kidney. so either you don't give them your kidney and going to jail for drunk driving with lethal outcome or you give them your kidney and going to the jail anyway because drunk driving is illegal but you are getting lesser sentence because death wasn't  an outcome (only great bodily harm). to sum up first example: you are going to jail either way but for more time if you choose not to donate, you are still not forced to donate those organs to the victim. now let's consider scenario where the crash was caused by car components failure and driver did nothing illegal. then the driver can just...walk away. they is not bounded in any way to the victim. and even if they decides to donate blood to this victim while they are bleeding out they can stop it anytime. so you have  options: compare sex and getting pregnant to criminal activity and give people sentences depending on pregnancy outcome or just accept that sex is legal and people can't loose any of their right because of participating in it. well, maybe there is a third option: taking your head out out your anus and be consistent without targeting only pregnant women. that means: forced organ, blood and tissue harvesting for people who caused any type of harm that needs such donation. no matter was it intentional, negligence or completely legal. forced life-saving activities. you made mistake and caused fire because you had faulty electric appliances in your household? now you need to personally dive into the burning building to save everyone. and of course we need to abolish any self-defense for people who caused the situation. kyle rittenhouse should go to jail, right? it's not only about pregnant women. that would make you misogynist and we don't want thatz right?"
at least a dosser driving an electric scooter won’t kill anyone if they crash into someone. can’t say the same for cars

"now, i bought another no brand electric maxi scooter, and it has gone through hell and back (literally, check my post history) and it's still going strong, battery still holds -% of the original charge after a year of constant use, motor got slightly damaged in the crash, so it lost like / of power, but i can see myself using it for at least - years more."
"inside it looked like a museum for the world's deadliest roller coasters. cars, motorcycles, golf carts, all sorts of vehicles were set up on tracks leading to thick concrete walls. squares of blue padding hung in the center of the walls with a white bull's eye painted on each."
"my city in canada recently got a shared scooter program, and i love it, but i would love to own my own scooter even more, because the kmph feels too underwhelming to drive on the streets, but the lack of suspension makes driving on my cities terrible sidewalks a nightmare. i would use the scooter for recreation (obviously they're super fun!) and to commute to and from work, between bus stops, etc. my budget would go maybe as high as $ -  cad, and i would like something lightweight enough to be folded up and taken on the bus, but also with enough suspension too smooth out those bumpy sidewalk rides. i've been looking at the apollo lineup (particularly city , air, & explorer, but also the niu kqi as i prefer its price point, though i am worried about not having suspension.any thoughts about these scooters here, or does anyone suggest any alternatives? thanks everyone!"
"for direct combat, ravee emulates a hero that her br-* someone that she knew told her about. by having winona gellify ravee’s arm, ravee can use act  to compress it with kinetic energy, causing it to build up tension and pressure. when the time is right, ravee can release the arm and add more energy to it, causing it to rocket out forwards with immense speed and force. this is the swar kata [chikari] technique or as the character called it “gomu-gomu no pistol”."
"moving away from that for a moment the color blue representing sadness is a simple idea and it feels innate to link the two, but being able to capture visually how the abstraction of a color tinges your lived-in experiences and emotions stemming is anything but simple to pull off and that’s one of blue’s biggest assets. your mind drifting off due to defense mechanisms in place to cope with pain and the impressions you get while you’re away being linkable to the stimulus of a color is something so unspeakably identifiable. this isn’t a very information driven movie but one that basks and ruminates in the consequences of the scenario. the associations of the mind are a pretty mysterious thing and this is tapped into beautifully. it’s also done with a soaring operatic musical score where fading out of a conversation is accompanied by it, because the human mind really does go to these primal places as we retreat inward. the movie’s a true etude in mood."

adhd is like riding a skateboard down a hill with the worst speed wobbles known to man. sometimes you can miraculously pull through and make it down to the end of the hill but most times speed wobbles get the best of you and crash.

he never took that route at night.
"oh and for extra information, especially with the electric kick scooters, recommend that they get a full face helmet with mips, since most crashes in kick scooters results in the face being hit, and mips is a layer that detaches inside so the helmet spins without snapping your neck."

(i know i might be a bit young.) last year i became part of concrete friend group. there are four of us (all girls), being: lily, the talented visual artist and singer, who is also the innocent and responsible one. sophia, who is the big brain math nerd, comes off as entitled because her family is very rich, but is actually really honest and funny once you get to know her. ella, who is very smart, bisexual, singer and plays volleyball. oh, and me. i'm the funny one, bisexual, athletic (currently incapacitated due to bad skateboarding injury. haven't walked in four months, it sucks ass). and visual artist. so, to begin the story: in july of , i came out to ella as bi, and to my surprise she came out to me as bi too! i was planning to tell sophia and lily as well, however me and ella had a mutual agreement that we would tell them together. ella wasn't quite ready yet, however, so we waited a few months. because of this shared secret, we had a huge trust increase. we grew really close, and we became really close within our already tight friend group. in august i started developing some feelings for her. i tried to ignore them as best as i could, but they wouldn't go away. this continued in september, when we finally came out to lily and sophia, who were very supportive and proud of us. this crush started fading when ella started being observably critical, around mid-october. me, sophia, and lily all agreed on this. she has a bit of judgy personality as it is, but it was getting harder to ignore. during these few weeks, me and sophia had a brief period of disliking her while lily wasn't so sure what to think. so, beginning of november and ella has gotten a lot better. lily and i both are trying to get things back to normal, but sophia still insists on this let's all hate on ella parade. she thinks i'm % on her side, while in reality, i am on neither. i told her that ella has gotten better and that i no longer have any sort of grudge against her, and she half-agreed and half-ignored it. ella is oblivious to all of this, and i think we should just put it all in the past unless it starts again, or at least gently bring it up with her. so, the month of november passes and december is here. my crush really started to pick up in early december, and on some days the thought of her was the only thing that got me out of bed. i've been actively trying to be a little extra flirty with her, and honestly, she's been sending it back. there are some instances where she's held my glance for slightly too long, and she's been very touchy recently. i actually have a suspicion that she might reciprocate my feelings. we've been getting along really well and the most recent class we had together was art, where we had two full scale laughing fits with laughter crying and we organized a horse funeral, which is an extremely obscure inside joke. it feels like we would work so well together, and i honestly feel like we have a chance at something here. however, i most definitely have my doubts about whether or not she likes me as well. she talks constantly of a girl on her volleyball team (the girl is gay, and ella, who is easily the most beautiful girl i've ever seen, definitely could get with her), adding that to the the way our friend group is structured, a romantic relationship would be very awkward and probably wouldn't work. i understand i am only in middle school, and i know it doesn't mean a lot to be in a relationship, but i can hope.  i figure that our chances of a romantic relationship will definitely increase in high school as the group will most likely drift apart slightly. &#xb;apologies for the length. it's a pretty long read. also i'm really sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. not sure where to go :(please leave any advice that you think can help. thank you! happy new years everyone."
it all turned very corporate after that. skating sort of died out until the tony hawk game came out which seriously revived the scene especially after stuff like x-games and warped started.

"vehicle crash deaths are down in the city so far this year, the nypd says.as of thursday,  people have been killed in car crashes, eight fewer than this time last year, cops said.pedestrian fatalities in the five boroughs have dropped %, from  at this point in  to  so far in , nypd statistics show. six bicyclists and five people on electric scooters and other electric devices have died so far this year ― the same as died in the same period of , the data show."
"even though it’s only small amounts, any object/creature within the hex would be directly affected (it doesn’t only draw ambient heat)? if realism is desirable, considering the effects on movability could be worthwhile. movement is heat, cold is retardation, rapid retardation is a crash, the level of rapidity is affected by the initial speed. i don’t know exactly how much it would take, but if i’m for example in the middle of a tall drop on skateboard, and my body loses a little bit of heat just before the landing, i imagine that could mess things up quite a bit. either the legs are simply too stiff to absorb the shock, or the sudden change in movability, even a tiny one, could cause me to miscalculate and miss the landing, suddenly the ground hits me sooner than expected."

"i want to preface this post with the following: i love psychedelics. and i truly appreciate their impact on my life. i don’t think they are harmful at face value and have great upside. plus they are fun.however, i think there is a point of unhealthy use that many people subvert, ignore, or deny. and i would like to cover both the positive and negative impacts i experienced while tripping twice a week on high doses for  months straight. my first trip: in october of  i was at a low point in my life emotionally. and while i seemed happy, motivated, and maybe even just in control of my life… it was quite the opposite. my use of marijuana had hit an all time high as i began to feel numb to the effects of the drug causing a psychological need for being high. it was basically an addiction at that point. i could not be sober at any point in the day.my good friends and neighbors who i smoked with had some experience tripping on both acid and shrooms and convinced me to join them. i was so down on life that although i was afraid, i could not care less at this point. i really just wanted to get high. i loved it. something clicked for me when i took my first tab that i still cannot explain. for better or worse, i needed to take lsd again. a sentiment that i have still not shaken to this day. the binge:i was taking at least -ug of effective lsd dose weekly, and - grams of shrooms. usually every - days i would trip, rotating between the two substances. and also i tripped on dmt on a less frequent basis (spirit molecule). this persisted for  months. the positive effects:- questioned more about who i was, what i believed, and what i should do with my life ultimately leading me to be happier with who i was- found peace in my mental health that i previously did not have. specifically a mental illness of sorts i have had to face that came to light a few months before all of this. not to say i cured it haha. but i feel better about my mental health.- loved my friends and family much more. this cannot quite be quantified. but i became much more sympathetic, caring, and kind.- started a blockchain data analytics company i conjured up in my head while tripping balls and have been able to create my own successful career around it. - bonded with roommates and neighbors a lot, we are all best friends who are actually emotionally connected on a pretty deep level. they are my people now. i am going to list some changes in my mental state that i noticed during or after this whole journey.the negatives (all of which i had not really experienced before or much after my binge):- i slowly lost touch with reality, but not in a fun or cool way. i was paranoid, as the rules of my life before psychedelics no longer applied. and it did not stop when the high ended. it was a constant state of mind.- persistent delusions of self importance or a belief that i was smarter than all of the drones around me who were not using psychs. i was awakened.- genuine fear of physical injury manifested and i was terrified of anything involving risk. i even had to stop driving because i was so afraid. i feared injury even when doing simple things like stepping off a curb, because i would be flooded with images of my ankle snapping in half and so on. i quit skateboarding. i quit playing pickup soccer. i quit rock climbing. the list goes on.- the basic rules that govern our lives became meaningless. nothing i experienced while not on psychs felt real. and i came close to losing my mind a bit i think. and perhaps induced psychosis on a few occasions. i truly had no fait that the ground i walked would not open up in to a chasm, or that a car would not come flying off the road in to my bedroom. or even that gravity would continue to hold me down. all of the things i never thought about suddenly felt like a real possibility.- gained a dependency on lsd specifically where i literally needed to trip somewhat often or else i would start to become less stable. - weed smoking got worse, like much worse. i was smoking well over an / per day- started to identify as a druggie and it shattered my perception of self worth - contemplated suicide more than what should be accepted as an occasional stray thought. why did my life matter when i was a meaningless human unaware of the greater things at play in our galaxy. i felt small and useless when i considered that i understood nothing important about reality besides the fact i cannot understand it. - became kinda obsessed with conspiracies, or rather the idea that we were being lied to constantly. and although it started in a somewhat logical manner... it quickly went out of control. a few things still stick with me today, but i never really went past the point of no return here. i have some freinds (i use this term loosely) who think we live on a flat earth and the sky is a firmament underwater. idk, i never went that far. but corporations fucking us, psyops, and alien cover ups... you could sign me up.  neutral effects (or at least not negative exactly): - no longer have any sort of religious beliefs that fit current forms of organized religion. if i were to guess based on my own dmt experiences we have eternal souls that get wiped of memory every time we are born. but when we die, the soul regains its memory and then upon birth in the next life or whatever you once again are a clean slate until death. this is because my dmt trips have a consistent theme where my entities that ive met are always telling me i have to complete my life ""mission"", and they dont know why i chose to do this one. and maybe in my next one ill pick a better ""mission"" of sorts. idk what the fuck all that means, but it sure feels more real to me than whatever religions people subscribe to here. but that opens the whole ""what if dmt is just a stupid drug and its all conjured up by your brain"". so, i dont really care to find out or consider what happens when i die. until i die. - i decided after some dmt trips that something greater is at play… but i don’t know what it is and it certainly does not fit in to the typical box of societal beliefs such as religion or anything else. - became a-political and could not care less anymore about what happened, mostly because i lost trust- more globalist, viewing humans as all one large culture nowadays largely due to the internet - stopped playing video games - i don't trust science anymore, especially given that i think we have no clue what the fuck is actually happening on this planet, in this galaxy, or in the universe.  - i have crazy lucid dreams now. and i remember them almost completely. was gonna put this in positive effects because its kinda dope, and makes going to sleep a lot more exciting. long term effects that i still notice now that i am sober:- i desire to trip, strongly. even after months of being sober. i think about tripping constantly.- i am afraid to take more dmt (still have like $ worth but i will probably save it for the future when i am ready again) - feeling like nobody knows how i feel anymore. besides a select few friends who i have shared with. how can anyone actually relate to my reality now that it has been so fucked.- harder to connect on a person to person basis when my more serious thoughts are so abstract now that they would sound too crazy to express to others and not feel judged. i always feel like i have a self imposed filter now. i truly worry if i expressed my thoughts on life and consciousness i would become an outcast.- content with my sober self, don't feel the need for drugs anymore besides a want to trip. the dependence is gone.- less willing to have sexual relationships with people i am not deeply connected to. i just cannot quite do that anymore. i don't really know why, but it has had an impact on my personal life, and habits.this is just what i noticed while using excessive amounts of psychedelics. i would in no way say my experience is telling or predictive of what you would experience if you did the same. ultimately it all came crashing down when i took  tabs of acid and just kinda had a breakdown internally as i was laying in bed. i just could not do it anymore. i also finally felt like i had a trip that ended with a closing of the book so to speak, almost like each before was just a chapter in my novel of a journey. not to turn this to a trip report but i wrestled with my ego and murdered it (all in my head of course) and ultimately woke up a very different person.as much as i grew and became a better and happier person by the end. it was a level of mental stress that pushed me to my limits and could have had (and still might) very real long term effects on my mental health. and i felt the need to share this somewhere, where people might understand or relate.i hope this does not sound like the rambling of a mad man, but rather an attempt at a self critical reflection on my experiences taking things too far. the rose and the thorns. as i think psychs are often built up to be one or the other. goodluck, and have fun tripping. it does not alway have to be serious. but try to be safe."

"well, only one of the articles mention cars being the issue (the galindo article is actually referencing the sepulveda accident...details on galindo is here: galindo he was riding at  am and not with permission. article also points out he collided with a vehicle). the other three were people who crashed their scooters. nobody wears helmets, and i'm betting that's a major contributor to deaths on scooters. those things are inherently dangerous by their design. decades of injuries from kick scooters validate that. add an electric motor for speed, and you've just compounded the issue signficantly."

"hi all! so i just can’t take not driving anymore, and sitting for any extended period of time is pretty much out of the question right now so i thought an electric scooter might be a good solution to get around.i’m not sure if something exists that could accommodate me, but it would have to both be lightweight, and have very good shock absorbers to not further damage my back.any ideas of models i could get living in canada at a reasonable price? i know i’m asking for a lot but i’m on long term disability so my income is very limited.this isn’t a massive rush though so if you think of something upper class maybe i could wait for a sale or black friday etc. thank you!!"

"and then we get into ev motorcycles. there's two huge problems here: cost, and aerodynamic drag. you can avoid both of them by aiming for a lower performance level - those  or / cc classes are going much slower and drag is much less of a problem, which reduces the amount of battery needed, which reduces the cost. and, get the batteries small enough, and you can make them human-portable, making charging easier in denser housing (instead of deploying charging at on-street parking, increasing the sunk costs of that parking and making it harder to get rid of, you can simply have people carry batteries into their home to charge), and making battery swapping practical for longer journeys (see things like the gogoro network)."

"there's a youtube channel of a russian scooter enthusiast who gathers footage of scooter accidents from the internet and packages them into sharply cut, highly educational videos.  would highly, highly recommend each and every rider to watch it all. if it were up to me, i'd make it a part of mandatory training course for anyone getting on a scooter. the creator does a bit of commentary which you can auto-translate as subtitles, but most of it, especially later ones is self-explanatory and quick paced. he does have a couple of his own crashes in the mix there too.it's not probably highly recommended by youtube algorithm because of its language, and because it's age-restricted due to content. just to calm people down, there is footage of crashes and falls, some of them quite gnarly, but there is no blood or gore or anything like that. just real world examples of *dozens* of important things people should learn to keep in mind while riding a scooter, that other people have learned the hard way.if you don't want to log in to youtube and give them your cc details and personal info for the age check, you can bypass youtube age restriction by ) installing a user script manager plugin such as [tampermonkey]( and ) installing in it [simple youtube age restriction bypass]( script. works for me.if you're in a massive hurry and only have time to watch a single reason why you should wear a helmet _and pads_, then personally [i would recommend this one]("

"i have reason to use a manual kick scooter for occasional transport.  i chose a scooter over a skateboard for two reasons.  a) less likely to fall off the scooter.  b) i have more control of the scooter in a crowd.  i can step on and off on a whim.  don't have to stop and bend over over to pick up the board.  and if i did fall, the scooter won't fly off and hit someone like a skateboard.  i chose a manual kick scooter over electric because a) i don't have to keep it charged and b)  it's easy to carry because it weights only  pounds and the handle folds down.  in good weather the scooter is efficient.  i chose an ""adult"" scooter because it has a higher weight limit and larger wheels.  i chose a scooter with hard rubber wheels that i don't need to keep inflated.  (small tires require air more frequently than say bike tires.)  down sides include that the front wheel can ""trip"" at a deep side walk crack or on a stick causing the scooter to unexpectedly halt, rain is slick, snow is slick, fall leaves are slick and hide things that will cause the front wheel to trip.  and of coarse, i need pavement.  these factors would be less if i selected a scooter with larger diameter wheels or maybe if i used inflatable wheels.  i've seen videos (in europe?) where guys were competing in the equivalent of mountain bike races on scooters.  these guys were bush whacking on the run up hills carrying their scooters and then kick scooting through some pretty tough stuff.  they had larger inflatable tires.  so there are off road designs somewhere.  i use the razor a lux.  there are other adult choices.  but don't go any smaller on the wheels than on the a lux."

"i was riding my skateboard through town to meet a friend at a restaurant. i was going downhill, and didn't see a chunk of sidewalk just, missing. ended up crashing face-first into the pavement, breaking my nose and fracturing my elbow. i was in pain, and i was bleeding profusely from my face, but all i kept thinking was how i was going to clean up the blood so i could meet my friend, and that i hope he didn't see that embarrassing crash! those thoughts started to go away once i got stuffed into the back of an ambulance, lol. funny how that's basically a universal experience."
"whats going on my skate community. so today as i was cruising home from town, i happened to get myself in a pretty fucked up situation. i decide to take this way that i usually don't take but i was like fuck it, i can do some flatground on this one street. so the end of this street (helen) gets pretty steep and lets out onto a somewhat busy road (king). usually it's clear to just bomb it and you'll be good but that was not the case today. as i'm on my way down, i feel good about being clear to go straight onto king but as i get on king, a car comes out of nowhere right to where i'm about to be. i could have sworn that her right blinker was on so she was turning onto the street i was going down but that was not the case unfortunately. right as i got onto king, she was inches from my face. keep in mind that i've been bombing this street so i'm going a good - mph and she's going about . my immediate reaction was throwing my arms out to embrace whatever i hit. i remember telling myself i was about to die. before i know it, i hear a huge shatter and i find myself standing in the middle of the road confused as shit. i look down and right arm is completely covered in blood. the blood-to-skin ratio was ridiculous. i notice i'm gushing blood from the spot on your wrist where you see the bulge of that purple vein. i got so fucking scared and then all of a sudden the woman driving storms out of her car, obviously extremely pissed off and terrified. she's definitely like  years old and had her young teenage son in the front seat. basically i smashed the entire back passenger side window. the thing is that i had my thick plastic water bottle in my right hand so that's what went in and embrace the impact and a lot of the glass. i am extremely fucking lucky i was holding that water bottle. my hand would be completely shattered if it were not for the bottle. the back of her car was completely littered with broken glass and i just had no idea what to do. i kept looking down at my arm and back up into her car and just being in so much shock.after screaming at me for a good  minutes, she gets me in the car and drives me home. my right forearm/wrist area was cut up pretty badly with a couple deep cuts with broken glass that i got out once i got home. i was taken the the er and given  stiches. today was wack"

"i rented my scooter from a small rental company. when renting i had to hand over my passport and i am also not covered by any kind of insurance. i thought it would be a good idea to ride late at night and when following a friend i took a corner wayyyyy too quickly and crashed head on with a brick wall (ouch). apart from a broken toe and a sore back i am okay but i am now very concerned about being ripped off by the rental company. the damage is quite significant with the front left panel being completely cracked and the front wheel is completely buckled and can barely turn. i think this is down to the forks being bent but i don't know enough about scooters to say this for sure. i am considering getting a quote from a small garage and seeing if they can do the work, although it was made very clear that all the work had to be done through the rental company. i was just wondering if anyone knew what kind of price range i'm looking at for the damage and if they really would know whether i had got work done elsewhere. if anyone has any better suggestions that would be greatly appreciated. thanks reddit"
"it takes surprisingly little impact to cause a traumatic brain injury. i see no reason besides ignorance, hubris, or vanity to not wear a helmet every time you are on a bicycle (or a skateboard or scooter, for that matter). it can and will save your brain if your head hits something hard. just falling over on your bike--not moving, not colliding with another bike--is enough impact to injure your brain depending on what object or surface you land on. and none of us are such perfect riders that we can perfectly control our bike in all conditions and control everyone around us. just wear the helmet. it only takes once for it to be worth it."

time and i'm trying my best. we're reaching, and passing, the top . the real core of the best of the best is coming up, and it's getting exciting for sure. many of these guys have been the best in whatever game they played in their prime, and many of these have had decade spanning careers. i don't know why i have such unnecessarily long intros. let's just get into it. &#xb;***\. otori***&#xb;[(meta knight)](#brawlmetaknight) &#xb;even before i started researching the brawl years for the first top , i was at least a little bit familiar with otori, the japanese player that ruled the international brawl scene in early . well, here he is, ""big bird"" himself. a name familiar to the readers of my brawl work but not much to modern competitive fans, otori was one of the world's best brawl players in his prime, usually regarded as one of the greatest players of the game.  although he played the game since its release, he only started competing in , to understandably limited success. however, through hard work and constant practicing, he had established himself as one of the best players in the east by the next year, but never one to consistently compete with the best in his region. for example, in , despite having attendance much better than the average japanese player at the time, he never made it past losers finals, always falling to some roadblock like b or nietono en route to claiming a title. otori's first trip to north america signaled a change in the times, and, at apex , he won the whole tournament in a massive upset over the best in japan and the americas, interestingly the first brawl tournament he ever won, regional, local, or national. now a top  player in the world and frequently placing well in both japanese and american tournaments, otori became in some ways, the precursor to the japanese players of today, traveling to american tourneys several times a year. you can’t talk about otori without mentioning his twin brother kakera who’s made his spot on the top  as well. as well as their history of traveling together across the world for tournaments, the duo was one of the best doubles teams in the world, winning the apex  doubles event over mewking and anti in two sets. in singles, kakera and otori were consistent names to tear up tournaments. at apex , otori's best tournament victory, his twin placed a respectable th, tying with another apex victor, ally. with just a glance at his results, anyone can tell that otori has clearly been one of the most important japanese smash players ever. unfortunately, his vibrant career stopped after brawl, citing disinterest in smash  and its successor in ultimate. nevertheless, he’s become an inspiration and rival to plenty as he evolved and redefined not only meta knight, but the way international players have been viewed worldwide. &#xb;***\. rain***&#xb;[(meta knight)](#brawlmetaknight) [(falco)](#brawlfalco) [(cloud)](#smshcloud) [(diddy kong)](#smshdiddykong)  [(wolf)](#u-wolf) [(joker)](#u-joker)  [(fox)](#meleefox)&#xb; you know a player's career is impressive when two of their best placings in tournament are  years apart. let's take a look. rain's breakout performance was at the jack garden tournament, where he placed th with his fox, and beating melee legend bombsoldier, one of two to do it ever, along with the legendary ken. after a hiatus from the game, he debuted his brawl career at apex , where he placed an impressive th place. rain continued achieving great results throughout brawl, dominating most japanese tournaments he attended, even over players like otori and a young ranai. after a th place at apex , he went through another hiatus before his smash  career, where he consistently placed top  in every japanese local and regional and placing well at american tournaments as well, like th at apex . after a brief respite from the spotlight of dominant japanese players, he achieved a th place at umebura smash final, smash ’s last major. rain has had a prolific and lengthy career, sure, but what was his peak? well damn, did rain have a peak.  brawl was a time of volatility, when mewking's handle on the game was in a bleak decline and several players struggled to snatch the throne. but who ended out on top? you guessed it: rain. in the beginning of the year, otori and nairo were often favored as the best player, but, through consistent firsts, a feat that neither or the two previous players could achieve, rain solidified his position as the world's best player, highlighted by a victory at the sun rise tournament in august. from sparce yet impressive results in melee to dominance in brawl to an underwhelming yet consistent career in smash , rain's lengthy smash career is definitely one to note. &#xb;***\. pc chris***&#xb;[(falco](#meleefalco) [(fox)](#meleefox) [(peach)](#meleepeach) &#xb;i remember a few melee summits ago when bts ran a skit titled [“the history of smash.”]([ . besides the unnecessarily mocking depictions of brawl and smash , the skit was a riot, especially for its retelling of early smash as we all saw it through the documentary. in their satirical zeal, bts made pc chris to be what pretty much everyone thought of him who didn’t know him after watching the documentary: emo skateboarder falco main. was he really that much of an emo skateboarder? ~~yes~~ well i never got to meet him, so i don’t know, but it’s pretty impressive for any player to make it onto any “history of smash” video, satire or not. before the days of the incredibly popular fox-falco combination, pc chris rocked the spacie dual main placing incredibly in tournaments throughout the world by hard work and adaptation. ever since melee released, he was always a good player, appearing in crew battles and playing at regionals before his claim to fame, but, when it was pc’s time to shine, he really made it count. in melee’s arguably first ever esports moments at mlg new york, he eliminated ken and became a hero in the eyes of the whole smash community. over time, he came to travel the world to compete and became one of the faces of the younger generation of melee’s greats and falco's first top level. in the documentary, pc said that a big reason he really got big into melee was because of an injury he received while skateboarding. injuries suck, yeah, but we can only wonder where melee, and smash as a whole, would’ve been without it. &#xb;***\. tweek***&#xb;[(cloud)](#smshcloud) [(bayonetta)](#smshbayonetta) [(wario)](#u-wario) [(pokemon trainer)](#u-pokemontrainer) [(wolf)](#u-wolf) [(donkey kong)](#smshdonkeykong) &#xb;from bowser jr. to dk to cloud to bayonetta in smash , then hopping between wario, wolf, young link, pokemon trainer, and joker, tweek is one of the most infamous main switchers and just one of the most successful smash  and ultimate players ever. aside from mkleo, many call tweek the most successful smash  player that never played brawl at a high level, and it certainly rings true. tweek started as the stereotypical player that was always consistent and scored high placements, but could never break into the highly coveted top . he tried everything. he switched mains from bowser jr. to dk and cloud, yet he still couldn't reach his goal. he moved from new jersey to ohio to live in a smash house, and that didn't work. but with a little bit of hard work and some use of everyone's favorite witch, tweek finally prevailed in mid  starting with a th at evo, followed by great placings such as winning mkleo saga and being the runner-up at shine. tweek finished smash  as the th greatest of all time, and nd best for , but he never truly reached international and out of game recognition until the release of ultimate. from his first win at glitch  to his most recent at return to yoshi's island, tweek has been heralded along with mkleo and samsora as one of the three gods of ultimate, and one of the four most successful players so far.&#xb; i could go on and on about his dozen or so tourney wins, exceptional set records, and his unique explosive, yet reserved playstyle. however, i want to highlight his relationship with his opposite and antithesis, mkleo. both players made a name for themselves starting in smash , yet the mexican champ had the headstart with his plethora of national wins starting any impressing the community at smash factor to blowing their minds at zero saga. tweek took longer to break into the top  then leo did, but even then, he still had the number so to speak on mkleo even when the marth main was considered more skilled. tweek’s big break and blowup moment ironically came at the tournament dedicated to leo: mkleo saga. leo struck back by winning the gg championship, then tweek did at momocon, and they’ve been trading national victories ever since. one half of a riveting rivalry, and an incredible player with years of success under his belt, tweek is one of the most skilled players to play smash, and one of the most skilled to ever play. &#xb;***\. alvin***&#xb;[(pikachu)](#spikachu) [(captain falcon)](#scaptainfalcon) &#xb;although he's a legendary player in smash  circles, many smashers aren't familiar with the undebatable greatest smash player from peru. in the early s, many  players heralded the almost legendary skill of the peruvian scene, mostly from the stories of superboomfan when he traveled there in . however, most were skeptical since no peruvian player had attended an american tournament. all that changed once alvin, after a shaky th at super smash con , started a reign of terror in the states, winning superboomed, ceo dreamland, and, most impressively, genesis , eventually scoring a nd place finish on the  league rankings at the end of . after ruling the scene in peru and reaching the caliber of top american players, alvin demonstrated that south america had more talent to give after zero's dominance in the west.&#xb;***\. adhd***&#xb;[(diddy kong)](#brawldiddykong)&#xb;while being estranged from most of brawl's veterans for not being successful in smash , adhd is definitely one of the most skilled and consistent players that have ever played any smash game. until the sudden rise of his tristate contemporaries, adhd was constantly in brawl's top , along with ally and mewking. he first made a name for himself at the original genesis, where he placed th, with a relatively easy bracket. most considered that a fluke, and that diddy kong, a character then considered to be a mid tier, couldn't compete with brawl's elite. however, the tristate diddy shocked everyone with a first place finish at pound  the next year, defeating mewking twice in winners and grand finals. from there, he proved that his signature technical style and strong fundamentals could triumph in the meta knight and snake saturated meta. four years in brawl's top ten proved more than diddy's potential at a high level; it showed that adhd's input intense gameplay is rewarded in smash's black sheep of a competitive scene. &#xb;***\. plup***&#xb;[(sheik)](#meleesheik) [(samus)](#meleesamus) [(fox)](#meleefox) [(mega man)](#u-megaman)&#xb;when it came to godslaying, leffen led the way. then, plup made it popular. a master of characters and platforms, plup has been one of the most adaptable, and likeable players of melee’s recent years. the only player to place top  playing  different characters in melee, the florida native has also been one of the biggest masters of diversity in recent years. he started competing in melee in  with samus. where the common grain of the time was for samuses, and generally everyone, to play campy and defensive, plup gave the space warrior a whole new spin with a balls to the wall attitude and slick new platform tech. he even reached the distinction as the th best melee player in the world in . the floridian still had much more to accomplish. after switching to sheik and placing in numerous top s, he was ranked th in . then th in . before being ranked th in , plup made history to be the second non-god player to take a legitimate set from armada since . then, just a mere two months later, he made history again to be the second player to win a melee major since the age of the gods. the unorthodox sheik main has been a mainstay top  player for half a decade, meta shifter, tournament winner, and the face of too many memes to count. especially with his recent success into ultimate with wins over respected players like salem and mvd, plup has easily solidified his position among the greatest players of all time. we can't wait to see what heights our favorite jorts are going to reach in the future.&#xb;***\. salem***&#xb;[(bayonetta)](#smshbayonetta) [(zerosuitsamus)](#brawlzerosuitsamus) [(snake)](#u-snake) [(hero)](#u-hero) &#xb;dammit. i wrote this long ass clever blurb on salem mixing in all of his various memes, iconic tweets and all, but now, a year later ""years of research"" doesn't hit as hard as it used to. huh. either way, smash's least favorite smasher until july th  more than earns his way into the list? even over tweek and plup? yeah, even over tweek and plup. salem's string of great performances was kickstarted by one of the most ridiculous tournament runs of all time at apex . really, i could write a good  pages on it's ridiculousness and iconicity. in short, i ranked salem as the th best brawl player in the world in . at apex , the first and by far biggest tournament of the following year, salem won. imagine if stroder, the th ranked ultimate player at the time, won evo? aside from the controversy that would stir because of stroder’s, uh, past transgressions, you can imagine the excitement and hype that would’ve surrounded an event like that. and salem did all of this with zero suit samus, sure, a high tier character, but absolutely unheard of to receive success at that level, especially at a time when % of player used meta knight and % were in favor of a ban. as much as we criticize salem’s cynicism of the melee and, really,  just the general community as a whole, you could say that it had an origin. after his miraculous apex run, many out of region foes were, you could say, skeptic of salem’s actual skill. a simple glance at his results following the tournament can say enough. i’ll just say that while brawl’s scene was active, salem only won a single tournament, being apex, and his results prior and following have much to be desired, a fact that many loved to point out in any smashboards thread for a tournament that he competed in. light derision soon turned to harsh criticism and even scorn at tournaments, especially by texas to xyro. his fellow tristaters were unenthusiastic in defense. combine this with the general hatred that the growing melee community had with the brawl scene (a game that salem continues to play even after two sequels), and you can probably see where salem is coming from. die a hero or live long enough to be the villain, eh?but what did salem do in response? not much, honestly. he slowly faded out of the top  in the following year, and, with a character crisis and general lack of attendance, he was largely written off in the first years of smash . then, the empire struck back. or should i say bayonetta struck back. i don't think any character really embodies salem's style as much as smash  bayonetta. years of an outsider status had hardened salem's already defensive zss play to a focused, well honed turtling machine in bayonetta. and did he succeed. when everyone wrote him off, said that his character carried him, and wailed at his incredibly campy gameplay, he finished his transformation into the ultimate villain by winning evo, sparking another worldwide debate on the character's legality. fire emblem saga and dreamhack atlanta were two more titles that salem put in his back pocket just in the second half of . now, heading into , what’s next for salem? he’s been on a steady decline since his legendary dominance in late , sure, but winning shine  and becoming one of the best snakes isn’t that bad. one of salem’s coolest, and i’d argue most iconic moments, was, well, at smash con, against his rival leffen. if there’s ever been an anime moment in a tournament, it’s this. the villain that became the hero vs the hero that became a villain. we can only hold our breath to see what the frieza of our smash community will accomplish next. &#xb;***\. superboomfan***&#xb;[(captain falcon)](#scaptainfalcon)

sweep western tournaments frequently. the most famous success story of this narrative is definitely super boom fan, who not only proved that western players could not only compete, but thrive against their japanese counterparts, but also that the era of the old guard of isai and sensei was over. his name may be hard to spell, but it's one that should never be looked over. with a deadly combination of captain falcon and pikachu, he's won tournaments the world over, especially within the north american scene in which he’s had almost complete control over. one of boom's most notable accomplishments was his winning streak in , , and . from boss battle  in september  to smash n splash  in june , boom won  consecutive tournaments, very reminiscint of armada’s  to  run or zero’s legendary  streak. and when i say  tournaments, these aren’t just locals. he won nationals and regionals alike even defeating powerful international foes already mentioned on this list like alvin, fukurou, and kysk. super smash con , genesis , smash n splash , big house , and, of course, super smash con , the largest smash  tournament of all time only just start to complete the canadian’s full list of victories. through his various accomplishments and sheer consistency over the tough competition of post- smash ,bboom has been the most active and one of the greatest professionals to ever play the n favorite. &#xb;***\. chudat***&#xb;[(ice climbers)](#meleeiceclimbers) [(kirby)](#brawlkirby) a wobbler since , chudat is one of the longest, if not *the* longest continuously competing melee players in the scene at the moment. since his career start, he’s been the source of countless memes, salt, and tournament losses for a good reason, he’s a fucking good at pressing the a button at a rythym. for real though, the face of ice climbers in competitive play since the mlg days, chudat’s sheer volume of accomplishments is impressive. by the time the competitive scene was in its infancy, he was immediately one of the best in the east coast. by the time tournaments were held regularly, he was a mainstage in the top , and he rarely dropped out of top . in , his most dominant year, the virginia native was consistently outplacing the highest echelon of players, like azen, isai, and chillin, only falling short of the immortal ken. in addition to his almost multiple decade career, chudat also had a brief brawl career playing kirby, and was a top  player at his peak. i could go on and on about each year he played in and how he performed in each. i could say how he was consistently top  in the old era of melee and is consistently ranked in the top  after the dark ages. i elaborate that he’s the only player to enter a reasonably big tournament in every year of melee’s competitive history. i could talk about how he’s considered the greatest ice climbers player of all time and how every icies player since him has echoed his style. just trust that chu is one of the greatest melee and smash in general players of all time. &#xb;twenty players left. until then\~"
"just my two cents, as a scooter rider, so take with a grain of salt:"
as always happy to answer any questions :)](r/daytrading/comments/scrvc/_live_trade_review_aapl_continuation/huhdr/)
"skateboarding was closely tied to punk from around  to  and to some extent -. wasn't always like that and it wasn't all genres of punk but mainly us hardcore punk and thrash/crossover, even darby crash from the germs was posing as a skater in the late s. although i only remember the late s as kid and observer, generally speaking if you did deep enough you would find new wave, thrash metal, goth, psychobilly and even alternative rock fans or people at least dressing the part who were casually into skateboarding which isn't the same today, of course skaters can listen to anything but it didn't attract as many alternative subcultures after the s. metallica had their own skateboard line in the mid s, it wouldn't be odd to look like street punk and skateboard back then either."
"in summary: get a bike if you want to exercise, and care about using it outside of just commute purposes. also if you care about safety, it's a safer option because it's generally slower and has bigger wheels."
walking a dog outdoor for long enough distances is very physically taxing on crutches (not to mention unsafe if the dog is liable to pull) or using a manual wheelchair. someone who is only recently injured is not likely to have the upper-body strength to do that for long enough distances. a powerchair or scooter is an option but then you’d think there’d be some mention of that as you’d need an accessible place to store and charge it.

"m. i went to the hospital a couple weeks ago after having a scooter accident, thinking it was my lower back cause i was having symptoms that reminded me of sciatica like shooting pains behind the leg, nonetheless i went to the hospital and the doctor that came wanted me to get a hip x ray, so i get the hip x ray and waited for hours and they said it was a hip strain and it looked like it was in or near my socket. they didn’t say how long it’d take to heal, and just prescribed me ibuprofen and that ointment that is like icy hot although i haven’t been using it. my question is is it normal for hip strain pain to last longer than - weeks? and does hip strain pain cause shooting pain in the calf as well? i’ve had shooting pain in the calf that comes and goes and sometimes it feels like i have a giant pimple on my behind but i know it’s just my hip/nerve, are those normal symptoms associated with a hip strain? also it still hurts to sleep at night even if i use pillows, i don’t have a primary care doctor sadly."

edit: i actually checked the open data for .  there was one instance of serious injury when a bike struck a pedestrian at a crosswalk.
"children are taught to manage danger and risk as opposed to avoiding it. for example, children as young as three will be taught to light candles and to cut their food with (increasingly sharp) knives. my four-year-old can already use a proper kitchen knife when she's helping me make dinner (although i certainly wouldn't let her use it by herself). if the kids get a small cut or a burn it's not a big deal, it will heal, and it will teach them how to handle these objects and situations, as opposed to simply being taught not to approach them in the first place (""learn how to make fire safely"" vs ""don't play with fire"")."
"also, please don't ride that thing drunk or stoned. we've had several posters recently who had thought this was an extremely clever thing to do (one hadn't even been here a week)."
"if something like that happens, immediately take a picture of the qr code on the the scooter and note the name/brand of the company (if it’s a rental). it can be tracked to the rider by the time and the unique code. by contacting the scooter company or a personal injury lawyer you may be eligible for damages."
"considering motorized anything arent allowed on the sidewalks what the motorcyclist did was very illegal they arent allowed to pass you and they arent allowed to use the bike path, they are road vehicles which means a scooter/moped and motorcycles are road use only as they hit over the speed limits and just like a truck and car they have to be obeying the behind the car rule, a electric bycicle(the ones that look like normal bikes)/escooter(the ones that look like normal scooters) is slower there for are allowed on the bike paths and side of the road only granted anything that goes khm and over is road use only and arent allowed on the sidewalks and bike paths."
"i haven’t fallen in the last  years. so electric skateboarding can be very safe. just slowly build up the speed and your skills. practice on empty parking lots and when you are well protected. make figure ’s , learn to make big carves, small carves, try turning by adjusting weight more on the front foot or back foot since you probably have a preference."
i’ve had people help me when i fallen before while riding my scooter and ask me if i was ok but it’s unfortunate that’s the attitude of society right now is a lot of people have little sympathy for someone crashing or getting hit by a car. it’s not like this type of victim blaming isn’t also common when it comes to cyclists or pedestrians being hit though

so i had a accident with a e scooter. i smashed mouth into concrete. i sheared off the back of one tooth and chipped another. these are front  teeth. the middle tooth didn't break. it also has a crown. today i got a crown on number . top left front tooth. the right top front tooth has a crown and no physical damage(tooth ) and then the tooth right of that one(tooth ) has a piece a missing. now since the accident tooth  feels funny. like it doesn't belong. numb to almost painful to bite into food with. tooth  feels fine. the dentist said basically shit happens. that i might get better or not.i cant even bite into soft bread at the moment with the issues tooth  is causing. i would almost have my top right tooth pulled if it doesn't go away.. i had  dentist look at xrays and they say it looks fine.  dentist said i had a small crack in my skull im guessing where the teeth meet the skull and that it should heal fine. dentist  did used the machine where it goes around your head like  times for xrays. besides that it all looks normal. even today i asked if it look all right at a nd dentist and said that it all looked okay.&#xb;any advice on this or have heard of this happening?

"tldr: could pems and headache be from csf leak and pacing is just giving it time to heal? bear with me as i might be talking absolute bollocks here but...my main long haul symptoms are next day fatigue after exercise, headaches and brain fog. my headaches are worse in the morning and feel better if i lie down. also entirely at the back of my head. i also get pressure behind one eye.for the first three months after covid, i was recovering very well slowly building up the exercising again probably at % workout intensity of pre covid levels. weight lifting, skateboarding, mini hiit sessions were all going well. pure cardio without a break seemed to be the last hurdle. after infection, three of seconds of running would cause me to crash the next day so badly that i could hardy move. after three months i could do  mins of decent intensity cardio without stopping. one day i got cocky and tried to go straight to ten minutes. at  minutes i felt this weird ""release"" in my head,but otherwise fine. continued my work out. next day i crashed again for the first time in six weeks. felt ok ish after another two days. so got back into the exercise. got carried away and went skating three days in a row. two days later i crashed again, since then i can hardly walk more than a few minutes and ive had constant brain fog and tension headaches for the past two weeks. the weird thing is, i noticed i get relief from these headaches when i lie down. googled that and the first thing that comes up is csf leak. so many of the symptoms match... i don't know if there's any science in it but i was wondering if the ""pacing"" i was doing was just allowing the leak to heal, and everytime i pushed it too far with the exercise the leak reopened and the headaches and fatigue came back. the worrying thing is that this time the headaches and brain fog have lasted longer than any other time that ive crashed. i'm awaiting results from a contrast mri and will see the doc saturday to discuss. for the more knowledgeable among you, does this theory hold water? should i discuss it with him? i also have a brain mri from  months ago but its from another hospital in another city, id love to get it for comparison but they're being super difficult and saying i need to go in person to collect it which is gonna be next to impossible before saturday."

not sure why she would have a hospital bill though. at the time of the accident she was admitted to a public hospital (alfred) via ed which is free (unless you decide to be admitted as a private patient which makes hospital care which would have been free subject to the excess charged under your private health insurance). perhaps she chose to have follow up shoulder surgery in a private hospital rather than public - understandable as it may have been quicker to access.

"i was on top of the world feeling very accomplished about passing a big milestone on my v. no hill was too steep for me after i got my esk. i shredded all my local spots and felt so comfortable about my environment. i was joking telling myself “ wow i can’t believe i haven’t even fallen off once yet” and the next second a deep patch of gravel came out of nowhere sunk my board and i went flying high. it happened so fast but luckily i was wearing a helmet and gear and only managed to scrape some skin off my right arm. gnarly but i got right up and got back on it. be safe out there yo, thanks to protective gear im hoping to get too  miles soon 🤙🏽"
"the upward tilt also solves for the problem of the rider's feet slipping off the front and rear of the footpads, causing falls and injury, as it positions the footpad decks at a net ten degrees opposite from each other allowing the riders feet to more firmly grip the footpad decks and prevent slippage off the front and rear of the one-wheeled electric skateboard."
"also, your skateboard example. did the child crash with no pads or helmet? where were they riding? what were the conditions? a  year old with no pads or helmet on a wet busy highway after dark. a  year old fully padded in a quiet grassed park."
"she and her friend are so flipping rude. assholes for sure! someone shows care and concern and yes, has probably seen plenty of broken noses and concussions so knows a little bit and they mock her? how is that kind and christian? ugh."
"i don't really know the skateboarding rules in vancouver. i obviously want to be as non-disruptive as possible - skateboarding is just a lot faster and more convenient and much cheaper than other forms of transportation. i always try to avoid ppl when possible because i don't want to run into anyone or anything, i just want to get from one place to the next. i also don't go super fast, and i've never crashed into anyone before. which one is the most accepted place to skateboard - road, sidewalk, or bike lane (and considering that there aren't bike lanes on every street)?"
"i don't know what you expect with so little information, but the market opportunity can usually be tested with a small subset experiment. point being you think about what you were offering then try to break out the smallest element or facet you can test. this is the essence of lean startup and the point of the stupid diagram with the car and then a sequence of a skateboard, bike, motorcycle and finally a car. nobody can figure that book out at all and pretty much all of them crash and burn. the principle is sound however."
"so why are they not replacing the defective controllers, but instead slapping a band-aid solution on in with added fuses (which should have been there from the start) and new chargers?"
"the quintessence of knowing the difference between a calculated risk and wanton recklessness. and one reason you haven't already sold your worldly possessions and are in vegas right now, taking a little break as you type your posts."
"the pros are that they are more portable and easier to store away, cheaper both buying outright and also cost to use vs gas cars, can be upgraded with an electric motor to go faster and still be cheaper than gas, better for the environment (just in air pollution, but also potholes since they are smaller and will not create potholes, or at least only super tiny micro potholes so roads will not need as much maintenance), easier to repair due to not needing jack stands and all that, cheaper to repair as well, allowed on other paths such as parks and hiking trails, can get through traffic a bit easier (either going through vehicles like motorcycles, or you can dismount and get on the sidewalk, not riding most of the time, just walking it side by side), and the fact that they can be treated legally as both car and pedestrian. when on the road, they have the same rules and laws as cars (although a few restrictions, such as they are not allowed on highways or freeways, so your talk of a true  mph zone means they legally should not be there at all), but they can also easily turn into a pedestrian to cross a crosswalk to safely do a left turn."
"both times i was fine but again, the fact that they didn't even immediately come to mind like just because we're pretty accustomed to the idea of getting mowed down by , pounds of metal and combustible fluid on a daily basis. related: cronenberg's ""crash"" is an excellent film."
"the angled frame rails of this invention and disclosure lower the center of gravity at the contact points--i.e. a rider's feet on foot pad decks--by as much as possible without losing any clearance at the front and rear bumpers, and tilt the gyroscope to change the zero-degree level default position to five degrees"
"anyone have a scooter with a wide deck where they can fit both feet side by side? either stock or modded? i've bashed my ankle at least   times now. have thought about modding my m knockoff to have a wider deck by attaching custom cut plywood on top and some skateboard deck grip. considering a tear-drop shape, wider up front for  feet side by side and tapering to normal width at the back. thinking the width + taper might help me avoid mashing my ankle on the kickstand, deck edge, or back axle. thoughts, anyone?"
"there are no 'no electric scootering"" clauses."
i was skating down a steep parking lot and i went so fast the only way to stop was by jumping off of it. a car was coming towards me from the left and i jumped off the skateboard just as we were about to crash. i was fine but the board got stuck under a car and getting it back was a pain in the ass
"you keep bringing-up cars like e-scooters could be a replacement for them. it's not a fair comparison, even if we both agree that cars are also a problem."
"be careful on unknown roads, go slower then usual. be very careful or avoid skating during rain. always watch the road for obstacles. and constantly anticipate the traffic ahead of you and what might happen."
"in china some  years back, there was an explosion of e-scooters and mopeds and they were clearly preferred by the average city dweller but according to chinese authorities, they were causing a nuisance parking wise, spilling all over pavements. in spite of the fact that obviously they take up less space than cars. then they moved to discourage them. prior to this in just a year or two i recall that some  million e-mopeheads had been taken up and were wildly popular."

"after riding the v on full tilt, none of us ever went out without a helmet ever again. shit was fast. so fast that, if something went wrong, no amount of you 'learning how to fall' would save you from whatever your head was going to hit . seconds after you realized something went wrong."
"a salmon fisherman who abandoned ship by leaping into the frigid waters of the columbia river last summer -- an instant before another motorboat crashed into his -- has filed a $, lawsuit against the other driver.clatsop county sheriff’s deputies accused boat driver marlin lee larsen of several crimes after the -year-old told investigators he couldn’t see where he was driving because he was sitting down and the dash of his boat was blocking his view. larsen said he probably should have been standing, according to the sheriff’s report, which notes larsen uses a motorized scooter to get around on land.larsen’s son-in-law, who also was on the boat, told investigators that he had warned his father-in-law to pay attention, that he sometimes sees his father-in-law using his cell phone while driving the boat and that his father-in-law had been off-and-on his cell phone the morning of the crash, according to the sheriff’s report.although oregon law heavily restricts cell phone use while driving, there are no such specific laws governing boating. but it is against the law to operate a boat without due care.the lawsuit, filed earlier this month, claims larsen was boating while distracted by his cell phone on the morning of the aug. , , when the crash occurred near the mouth of the columbia at the pacific ocean, just east of fort stevens state park.the suit was filed by bryan maess, , an off-duty hermiston police officer fishing with a law-enforcement co-worker, christopher mcmahon, . another friend, roni durham, , a clatskanie resident, also was aboard.a gopro camera mounted to the weldcraft fishing boat captured the frantic seconds as larsen’s bayliner trophy motorboat speeds directly at them. mcmahon can be seen waving his arms and yelling in an attempt to get larsen to steer clear -- just before the trio jump into the water.the video was shared with the oregonian/oregonlive by the publication salmon trout steelheader and angling oregon, the latter of which is an online fishing website of mcmahon's. the video encourages boaters to wear life jackets. maess and mcmahon weren't wearing life jackets. durham was, but it didn't inflate.sheriff’s investigators wrote that it was likely maess and the others would have been seriously injured or killed if they hadn’t jumped into the water.maess suffered vision problems, headaches and injuries to his ankle, leg and arm from jumping into the water or being struck by debris, according to the suit. five months after the crash, he wears a knee brace, the suit says.mcmahon and durham also suffered injuries, including cuts or hypothermia. they haven’t filed suit against larsen but have hired attorneys who say they plan to. portland attorney josh lamborn said his client, durham, also has suffered psychological trauma and, even though fishing is a big part of her life, hasn’t been able to go back out on a boat since the crash.larsen, a roseburg resident, told the oregonian/oregonlive by phone friday that he wasn’t using his cellphone while driving his bayliner and referred to such allegations as “fake news.” larsen also said a lawsuit seemed unnecessary because the people in the weldcraft weren’t hurt badly.the criminal case is ongoing. larsen has pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor crimes of reckless operation of a boat, fourth-degree assault and recklessly endangering the lives of others.the suit was filed in clatsop county circuit court. portland attorney james mccandlish is representing maess."

"i have been scolded so many time for not being fully padded from our friends in this group. i was mildly resentful and embarrassed when that happened.my son is young and always wears pads. i am always almost fully padded now. i had a huge fall/ slam in a bowl took me three weeks to get back on my board. if i had not been padded, there is a high probability i would have broken my hip and cracked my head open. definitely whacked my pelvis and have been feeling a bit of nerve shit on one leg. i’m back to riding but i’m so super cautious now. so from “mom” please please please make good choices out there. please wear pads. please wear a helmet. push yourself, have fun. wear sunscreen. don’t buy drugs from the kid at the park, go to the dispensary like an adult. love y’all thank you allfor being such a huge inspiration to me!! stay safe."
"if that accident occurs because the board malfunctions or is faulty then it’s on fm, but be sure i’m aware of the potential beforehand and taking appropriate precautions."
i shoved the envelope into my jacket and hurried out the door. once i got onto the sidewalk i went to pull out the envelope when my phone buzzed.
you could get a full face if you think you will wear one and don't mind the extra discomfort and size. i usually recommend the giro one as it is sufficient for around mph. as a bike helmet is it the best you can get without going full face for chin protection. i rather people wear a bike helmet rather than nothing.
"we could deep dive into specific statics on how probably +% of skateboards bought barely see any use. millions of kids buy a skateboard each year and never take it beyond the driveway, but statistics don't show that. only boards bought vs deaths. but that's a much longer study that would take quite a lot of time to compile. cars on the other hand see extreme use on almost every purchase, logging tens of thousands of miles and vehicle hours."
conclusion
"she and i were diabetics. we would sneak off to go shopping and actually go eat pretzels at the mall. so bad, but it was fun! she would crash her electric scooter into the shelves at stores. we always went shopping for christmas decorations together. she would go to baseball games and have so much fun!and she loved her grandson so much!"
this week i plan on watching the new tony hawk documentary. and it'll probably make me want to pick up my skateboard again.
"needing some reassurance. i’ve bought my skates and i’m just waiting on my protective gear monday before i start practicing. i’m excited to learn but also very scared. i am mainly scared of injuries. i have no health insurance and i feel like if i broke something i’d bankrupt myself. but it’s a bit ironic because i use to ride horses which i think is a little scarier than roller skating in my opinion. i’ve fell off running horses, i’ve been kicked and bitten by horses. i still have horses but don’t ride them so i haven’t really been “risky” i guess i think i just need some reassuring words about roller skating because i already feel like the fear of injuries is making me feel defeated. my boyfriend is not saying that to be controlling. i just think he knows that i am probably thinking about that (which i have been) what do you think?edit:thanks for input. i’m reading all comments still"
then it will be permissible (in the reddit hivemind) to make fun of him again.
also a friend went on his cc scooter to buy something to a nearby shop. it was summer so he went on tshirt. in a roundabout like mins from our place there was sand or something on the road and he fell going kmh. you can't imagine how bad the rash was.
"there are two buttons on the apollo, plus two turn signal buttons.  power on/off makes sense, but the other functions for turning lights on or changing modes are maddeningly obtuse.  frankly i have no idea how its supposed to work and used the app to change my mode.  handlebars are wider than they need to be.  suspension feels plush, but i havent tested on rough roads or curb jumping to see how well it serves its purpose."
"the issue with the irt trains (, , , , , , ) is that they are fairly narrow.  they are only  feet wide vs the  feet width of the letter trains.  so people will definitely notice a scooter and especially a bike when the train is crowded."
"with bicyclists, the cons are you can't go as fast, you have no weather protection, you need to buy and wear extra gear for safety (glasses for bugs and harsh weather to protect eyes, helmet to make sure your head doesn't crack like an egg, and pads so your knees, elbows, and wrists will be better off in a crash, and locks in hopes the bicycle won't be stolen), they also are way easier to be stolen, and very dangerous since cars either can't or won't look out for them, and many states will not allow them on sidewalks at least in busy areas legally."
"if you want to find an apartment for short-time rent, you can use list.am. it’s a local website for all kinds of ads and it has more options that international websites like airbnb. it can be cheaper, too. the website itself has an english menu, but some of the ads are in armenian only, so you might need to use google translate."
"my goals are getting better at riding the pool (drop-ins, also with surfskate), maybe some small ollies to get up and off sidewalks, infinite loops and better slides especially going off an incline."
yup that's all. maybe they can be priced according to the level of assist the person uses like full throttle or just a little bit to make them more economical.
"we also legally have to wear helmets here, not allowed on sidewalks (but i mean if there's no one on the sidewalk i may go there temporarily if the road is looking rather horrendous), and have a  mph (i think  kmh?) speed limit."
"what if red turns her gun into a car?: this is tricky. a small gun zooming around and sneaking through the pile-up could easily catch winona and ravee by surprise if they aren’t careful, especially with how fast it would be going. however, it’s still limited by a car’s movement, and tight control from ravee surfing on the hubcap board will let her essentially juke it out if it’s in the open, and stay behind cover if it’s trying to ambush us. plus, this means red is without her own gun, so winona has an opportunity to run up on her and stock car boy without her most reliable ranged option."
"oh, i have  made a list ( this was inspired by duncan macmillian and jonny donahue's play, ""every brilliant thing"" & i highly recommend you watch). so here is my list of every brilliant thing:"
the mother of all crash story threads:
"- folding e-bikes are probably a good middle ground.  i never liked normal folding bikes because they seemed too much of a compromise in terms of speed, but folding e-bikes basically remove the speed compromise.  they are more compact than normal e-bikes, and they can fold into a smaller shape (though that shape is more of a cube than a narrow shape).  plus, like all e-bikes, they allow you to assist with pedal power when going up hills.  the downside is that they are still slower than non-folding e-bikes (though not as bad as normal folding bikes vs non-folding bikes), and the folding mechanism may be a chore to fully fold & unfold."

"fun story: i’ve ridden  km on a xiaomi pro . after that, i sold it and upgraded to a widewheel which already has about  km on it. i am a car driver too so i have experience, but i bought a helmet just in case. anyway, familiar day, familiar road, dry conditions (summer hot), no fucks given…until i barely accelerated (max - km/h) and i somehow tripped over my wheel during a right turn. i was fine, the scooter is perfect (didn’t even scratch to my surprise), but what i did after i got up was feeling kinda stupid, still feels today."

"i saw two women on one electric scooter crash a few months ago. weren’t holding on tight and it wobbled and scooter went out to the side. one in front hit the pavement and went still. scary shit honestly, she woke up but ambulance came and took her on a stretcher."

"i'm filling out my own english to swedish notebook to study and take with me when i finally get to visit sweden and i'm currently writing down emergency/injury/sickness/health related words and phrases. i've got some basics down, such as ""jag mår sjuk"", ""var ligger närmsta sjukhus?"" ""min vän är medvetslös"" and ""kan du hjälpa mig?"". i like to skateboard, i'm hoping to take my board with me and check out sweden's rockin' skate scene (stapelbäddsparken here i come!) so i had a little chuckle writing down things like ""jag föll av min skateboard"" and ""jag tror att jag har brutit något"". (i know i know, skateboarding injuries are no laughing matter, but the thought of me looking up at a stranger saying ""hey man, i'm from the states and i've totally just wrecked myself, think you could help me out here?"" makes me giggle a little, having a good attitude takes some of the pain away)i'm also a woman in my early 's and i'm inevitably going to get my period at some point, so i was wondering how to best explain this in swedish? as i'm sure you know google translate is not the best, it gave me ""jag mens"" as an answer which doesn't sound quite right to me. i would also like to be able to explain to people that i am hypoglycemic, which basically means that if i don't eat enough and keep my blood sugar in check i have the potential to pass out (and alcohol kicks my ass harder and quicker than most people, booooo :[ )i would really appreciate some feedback, especially if i've made any errors in my previous grammar. tack så mycket!"

"so the story goes, around the time we received our last round of stimulus payments, i purchased a bird electric scooter, received it in march around the second week of the month, had no issue riding it but on june th i was riding back home from target going about  mph and the handlebars folded inward (it folds up and the handlebars attach to the back wheel) and my leg buckled underneath me, i fractured my ankle in three different places, fractured my fibula, and tore my deltoid. i was just curious because i know it’s been over  months since the incident i’ve just been preoccupied with other affairs and id like to know if it’s still worth filing a lawsuit given the situation and how much time has passed, how much money could it grant and is it to late? also it’s my first post so hi"
"the plan is put forward by ta - i don't know how much city support it has (despite what this article says), so i wouldn't get my hopes up, but if you read the plan you'll see that % can accomplish so, so much:"
"but the essence of working with the stats is calmness. you can do this if you are prepared to be slow and measured. quite literally. find out your stats, your tdee, your bmr, work out how many calories you need to eat to maintain your weight, work out what that is minus  calories or so to create a deficit. it’s slow, calm, slightly boring maths day after day. it’s a completely different animal from crash and burn diet tactics if you let it be."
"i've skated inline, roller skates, skateboard and mountainbiked, but this honestly seems like more fun then all tbh. look at them riding like skiers in the woods."
"honestly, it can be tricky too.  they will ride up on a scooter and try to snatch it from you.  the problem with this is potential injury as the camera is looped around your neck.  best advice is to have your friends cover your sides...and be alert.  take a look around before taking that shot, then put the camera away.  don't try to be the international press team."
psa to everyone out there. do not take your health and body for granted. a random act from someone could change it all in an instant no matter how careful you are! stay safe and please pay attention while driving. no one wants to be on either side of an accident like this.

"i would suggest learning basic motor control on a brushless dc motor. a great starter is actually with racing drones. another great start is also with doing a conversion for an electric moped or scooter. however, that has way way more inherent risk compared to a racing drone. a car battery can kill. a nicad battery really only has that issue if it massively overheats and even then it is more likely to just cause injury."
you should contact your insurance company and see if they can help you. at the very least i imagine they’ll point you in the right direction. you can also go to the police department (not  - that’s for emergencies) and file a complaint against the driver. there’s a police station on mlk downtown near the ymca.
was there last weekend & visited downtown. can confirm its somehow even more lawless and chaotic than dallas.
"aita for not wanting to replace a broken bottle of booze after a guy on a skateboard crashes into me? \+++tldr: while reading my phone and walking down the sidewalk, a dude on a skateboard carrying a bag of groceries crashes into me, falls, and breaks a bottle of booze. he thinks i should replace his broken bottle. i think the accident is his fault, so i walk away. am i the asshole for having done so? \+++nb: i had posted a longer version of this story that got removed for violating the rules of the sub. this version removes the offending portion of the story but gets down to the essential disagreement that started everything. \+++this story happens in paris, france, in a part of the city where there are very, very wide sidewalks—-think about  feet from where the buildings end and the curb begins. generally speaking, it's possible for about – people to walk abreast on these sidewalks, but when there are bars or cafés with sidewalk seating, the useable space of the sidewalk narrows considerably. also worth noting is the fact that paris is a world leader in protected bike lanes where cyclists, scooter riders, and skateboarders can safely ride on the street, off the sidewalks, without fear of getting hit by cars. \+++so here's the story: it's night time. i'm walking down the sidewalk and reading an article on my phone when i hear some guy yell, ""watch out!"" in french. at this point i should also mention that the wide sidewalks i had talked about before have narrowed because i was walking in front of a bar with sidewalk seating. instead of being  feet wide, it's about  feet wide now with pedestrians other than myself in the mix. so, to continue. a dude has yelled ""watch out!"" i'm walking down the street reading my phone. we're in a narrow space. i don't have much time to respond, and when i look up from my phone, there's a collision. turns out the guy who yelled ""watch out!"" was on a skateboard moving very fast. he's also carrying a big paper bag of groceries. because he's going very fast and because i'm a pretty big dude, the collision is rough. he falls off his skateboard and drops his grocery bag, breaking at least one bottle of booze and spilling at least one container of take-out onto the street. i feel bad that the dude crashed, so i go to make sure he isn't injured. i say, ""are you ok?"" in french. i say, ""i'm sorry,"" in french. dude is super, super pissed. he points at his broken mickey of rum and demands i replace it.at this point, i decided to walk away. the guy was not injured. he was just upset about the broken bottle of booze. i didn't feel like i should have to replace it because he ran into me, a pedestrian, while he was skating on the sidewalk instead of the protected bike line. aita?"
chose oncoming traffic because the parked cars give no space and either way i have traffic behind me.. hitting the person in front for cutting me off without a go pro is gonna be a terrible experience and i didn't want to get hurt from the drivers behind me incase they don't stop and run me over because tailgaters.
"# i am not op, this is a repost.original post from r/amitheasshole by u/helmet_throwaway**march , **[ (m) son (m) is a good kid and loves to skateboard. he's actually pretty talented, and is even ""sponsored"" by the local skate shop. he's skated since he was . until he was  or so i always made him wear a helmet. he started resisting wearing a helmet around then, and while i would prefer that he does wear a helmet, i know i can't control every aspect of his life. by that point his body had learned how to fall ""correctly"" when he screws up a trick (i used to skate back in the day, if you skateboard you know what i mean). so i made a compromise with him - if he's just out street skating with his friends, he doesn't need to wear a helmet, but if he's at a park that requires it or is skating a bowl or half pipe, or if he's otherwise attempting something dangerous for the first time, then he needs to wear one. he readily agreed and has been good about wearing a helmet in those circumstances.anyway, a couple weeks ago my wife (f) was running an errand the other day and saw our son skateboarding, doing tricks down a small -stair set, and he wasn't wearing a helmet. she flipped out, pulled over, yelled at him in front of his friends and made him come home. now... it's not that my wife didn't know about my helmet ""rules"", but in her view what he was doing qualified as dangerous (he can ollie down stair sets almost x that size). she's never really loved that he's been into skateboarding (she always wanted him to do team sports) and as such, i don't think she fully appreciates how good he is for his age nor does she understand that he knows what his limits are and what he's doing. she is now insisting that he wear a helmet at all times much to my son's chagrin.i pointed out to her (privately) that this is ridiculous. he's at an age where he can make this choice himself, and on top of that, our daughter (f) who does cheer and gymnastics and doesn't have to wear a helmet despite head injuries being fairly common in those sports. to make my point, i got one of those cheerleader helmets and declared that she now needs to wear a helmet too since her brother has to now. our daughter is kind of a weirdo and to her credit thinks this is all pretty funny, and said something like ""i will be known as the helmet queen"" and started wearing it at practice. my wife is now freaking out because she doesn't want our daughter to stick out at games or competitions and make people think that she's special needs (yes, seriously she said that). my wife is saying i'm both undermining her and encouraging our son to do dangerous things, and that our daughter is going to get bullied for wearing a helmet. so aita?**update is in the comments**[early-light-]( **(top comment)**>yta. you're too concerned with being cool to be a parent.  >  >everyone wears helmets, even olympic athletes.  >  >aside from safety, he could lose his sponsorship. nobody wants their brand tied to gross negligence and poor role models[helmet\_throwaway]( **(oop)**>this seems to be the most upvoted and widely shared judgment so i will accept it. though i will disagree about this being about me wanting to be the ""cool"" parent. as i mentioned i skated back in the day and i can tell you had my parents tried to force me to wear a helmet it would have made me absolutely not wear a helmet whenever they weren't looking because i was a dumb rebellious shithead. my kid is not those things, but my genuine concern was that forcing him to wear a helmet would be a fruitless endeavor because we literally can't always enforce that and maybe because of my own experience as a teenager i think it would have backfired.  >  >anyway since my kid is probably more likely to respond to edicts from the redditors than edicts from his parents, i sent him this thread and told him the internet thinks i'm an asshole and my new compromise is that he has to wear a helmet until he's . he thinks this is also hilarious and texted me, and i quote **""jfc i didn't realize you guys were beefing that much about me wearing a helmet. fine ill wear it. don't want you guys getting divorced because i don't want to look like a dweeb in my edits lmao guess i have to dweeb it up for now""**  >  >one last thing:  >  >\>nobody wants their brand tied to gross negligence and poor role models  >  >you know nothing about skateboarding companies lol**reposter's note: i have bolded oop's quote of his son because i consider it the main update. the conclusion is oop's son ends up agreeing to wear a helmet.**# i am not the original poster. this is a repost sub."

(check pictures)**battery life (/)**right pod died after  hours, left went  more minutes and died too. it can do  hours with -% volume. pods will beep once when they about the die and they will beep twice or  times when  minute is left after they die they make the disconnect sound.**sound and mic quality (/)**for real it's really good, i is (/) compared to this. it's clear, you can hear everything, it has a very nice bass, strong and powerful, it's well put together and i don't even use an eq yet maybe i won't even need it. nothing goes out of control well balanced lows, mids, highs. no output lag. my only problem is that the volume is like you are controlling % with half of your slider here is a picture what i'm talking about:  [ for it's price /. mic quality, i talked to my friend with it and he said it's nice there is no problem only a slightly echo but maybe because i was in transparency mode idk i have to try it again soon.**features (anc, transparency, touch, hey siri, wc, nc, gps) (/)****anc:**so who said it's not going to be real, you were right it's not real and tbh i can't hear any difference really if i'm turning it on and off maybe a little boost and nothing else. i'm slightly disappointed but i knew it's sounds too good to be true.**transparency:**transparency works, uses the mic and if you are not listening to music and you talk you can hear yourself talking twice, if you turn it off you can only hear yourself once. i was suprised it works but if you are listining it's not that good, better than nothing but not mind blowing.**touch controls, in-ear detection, hey siri, wireless charging, name changing, gps:**works fine with no problem.**overall (/)**for  bucks was it worth it? maybe, tbh i would buy a normal airpods hg clone from vincent because it's cheaper, it doesn't have that many new stuff which explains the  dollar price but this is only my opinion. i gpd for you guys and you can decide if you want to spend  bucks or not it's your choice. i like it and for me it was worth it, nice sound, stuff works didn't expect more from it."

"hi alli will be attempting snowboarding for the first time in a few weeks, however i was curious whether i should completely avoid snowboarding due to an old injury and stick to skiing or whether it may not have any affect at all.i have an old skateboarding injury where i broke both my tibia and fibia at the base of my leg, i have  plates and roughly  screws still there.although this injury has no effect on my day to day life (unless i manage to bump the plates) i am curious whether i should avoid snowboarding? or just be extra careful not to make it worse, or even have  ankles with plates & screws :)thanks"
"the government did push for cycling as a more widely used form of transportation all the way back in  or so under the walk cycle ride campaign. the gist of it is to get anywhere with a combination of walking, cycling and taking public transport. the initial plans were to pilot cycling paths in certain zones and increase bike stands in train stations just to name a few. these were good visions of course but the implementation was where it all falls apart. unlike many places in europe where roads were transformed into bike lanes, what was done instead was that the bike lanes were squeezed into pedestrian walkways. this severely limits the speed and comfort of both bike lane users and pedestrians. the uptake of electric personal mobility devices as well as bike sharing services also overtook the infrastructure development which never seemed to got out of the pilot phase. then in , an e-scooter rider crashed into a cyclist, killing her, which sparked an effective ban on e-scooters and many forms of pmds. all in all, back in , infrastructure design decisions as well as education on safe riding were already way behind the usage of pmds."

"winona, meanwhile, will set pits of gel around the arena to trap cars that try driving around. if she’s using the wrecked cars… well, f famously doesn’t do well on rough terrain. and for smaller objects turned into cars, these will just get stuck inside the gel pits. driving around on persephone won’t be as big an issue, seeing as winona is already quite skilled in navigating close quarters."
"oh my! i am sorry that happened to you. i was chased by a dog once and he legit tried to attack me, i was on my electric scooter and he saw me and ran after me growling and snarling and barking. my scooter goes pretty fast and he was able to keep up and was right at my ankle. i was so scared i was going to crash and that he would attack me. i had to keep looking down to see if he was losing steam, thankfully after chasing me a good - minutes he gave up and i was able to get away safely."
"buy the biggest wheel you can afford…folks have mentioned shermans.  i’d throw in the monster pro, the commander, or possibly even the nikola ar+.  i ride a suspension wheel and i even learned on a suspension wheel which most folks advise against as a first.  it was absolutely as hard as they said it would be but i knew that going in and was determined to learn on that wheel."

"side note: i was once called by a receptionist and shamed for seeing a walk in doctor that wasn’t affiliated with the office that i’m a patient of, lol. he ordered me my last mri for my previous sports injury. it scared me into never getting a second (or first, in person) opinion ever again because i don’t want to be de-rostered."
"so the only parts of me that used to creak and crack were my knuckles or my left knee (old skateboarding injury) however since starting bjj about a year or so ago my neck and my chest crack and creak too, this freaked me out at first but it's now just a daily occurrence that i've somehow normalised. how has bjj changed what's considered normal for your body?edit: i see i'm getting downvotes, any idea why? i thought this was a perfectly valid question?"
"managed to get the drunk kid and concussed kid to just go the fuck to sleep in the lounge, and then sent a nurse ra who we called in to administer first aid ride to the hospital with him."
student riding skateboard alleges he was riding across channel islands road about : p.m. he saw a silver/tan vehicle and the car neither slowed nor stopped.
"a relevant example of this is when he bought his first electric skateboard, a boosted board v. he only had one, but we would all go out with a bunch of normal boards + his boosted board. mostly we would take turns ripping it, but if it was just  of us we would use it to pull the non-motorized guy up hills & then race down."
"in the past couple of weeks i've noticed a huge uptick in the number of (privately owned) electric scooters along bike paths and lanes. obviously the weather has gotten warmer lately, but this is way more than i noticed last year too. are other people noticing the same increase? this is the by far the most i've seen since the short lime/bird trial years ago.note that this is not a complaint from me. more people using the bike infrastructure instead of roads is great, and if i wasn't physically capable of biking or couldn't shower at work one of these would be tempting."
"also please check local laws, many places in the us allow you to drive small scooters/mopeds on a normal driver's license. others require a learner's motorcycle permit. some may not require a license at all. in my state, anything going over i believe  requires a driver's license, anything over  or   requires a motorcycle endorsement of some sort."
"not that i wish ill, but my hope is that ) they do not procreate [we need fewer dumb people] and ) my tax dollars aren't needed to help them if/when they crash.  this applies not only to motorcycles, but bicycles and now those electric scooters.   these should help our gene pool in the long run."
"i had to write a paper in english a while back about rental scooters. the takeaways were that a lot of people don't really understand how scooters work and that a terrifying amount of people don't wear helmets. people were eating shit at a depressingly high rate either due to lack of experience, traffic not yielding, or just straight up incompetence. i've kissed the sidewalk on my own scooter before by hitting a bump at an awkward angle and losing balance. my paper's sources detailed emergency room visit reasons and a fair amount were related to vehicle impacts (though whether it was the car or scooter at fault varies at random). i have personally witnessed multiple people riding rentals and just slamming into curbs at speed thinking they'll just go up said curb. they do not go up the curb, they flip and eat shit. it's pretty sad to watch. people who ride more powerful/capable scooters generally understand the limits of the vehicle better and the handlebars make balancing much easier. they also usually wear helmets, but not always. conclusion: assume they are about to crash into you and steer clear if possible, especially if they're on a rental and not wearing a helmet."
i would never wear all that junk just to ride my scooter. i would also never own that scooter. if i wanted that kind of lifestyle i'd just buy a motorcycle.
"so i just saw a doctor for a follow up because my knee was still having problems a couple months after the initial injury. she brought up that she wouldn’t be sure until i got an mri, but she agrees with the previous doctor that i likely have a bone bruise and she thinks that in addition to that i might have a medial meniscus tear, mcl tear and some kind of patellar tendon issue based on the exam. she recommended i get an mri and physical therapy. i’m scheduled for an mri in  weeks but i’m really nervous about all of these potential injuries. does anyone have any idea of what to expect in terms of recovery or how this might impact me long term?"

"hi r/legaladvice!  i really need some help.someone crossed the street without seeing me and hit me while i was driving a cc scooter. in florida it is not required to have insurance for motorcycles under cc, so i was uninsured(my mistake). i went to er and stayed a day, did ct scans and everything. k total bill. the police deem the other driver's fault and my husband contact a lawyer in the same day.one month past, here is the surprise: my lawyer dropped my case because the driver's insurance from the driver claimed material misrepresentation for lying that he didn't have previous accidents, denying my claim for my medical expenses.so my question is: can the insurance deny my coverage in this type of situation? in my mind it does not make sense because when the accident happened he was insured, but only after the fact of my accident and later investigation the insurance claimed his policy was fraudulent and completely denied my case.one of my friends advised me to contact the florida office of insurance regulation and i'll do it as soon as possible, but i need more insight for this problem.thanks in advance for the help!"

couple of accidents already
"bro he popped his left arm out of his socket and needed a wee breather. i do this on the regular (old skateboard injury). hurts like a bitch, but you can pop it back in, rub it for a bit, then be off on your merry way. you just become more aware of what actions set it off, for example, reaching into the back seat while i'm driving will do it for me. hope that's all it is! the rest of his set was 🔥"
"oh, and anyone riding a full-on electric or gas moped on bike infra is the worst, but that almost goes without saying."
but that’s not directly causing it?
"a few months ago i was skateboarding on my university campus (skateboarding is allowed). i got up to full speed, because the pathway was clear and i was transitioning from smooth concrete to rough brick so i thought i would gather momentum. just as i got to full speed and the pavement changed, my skateboard hit a tiny metal prong sticking out of the ground (about  in.) from where a bollard (concrete pillar) had been removed and set aside to allow deliveries. this prong was completely invisible from my line of sight, but it was enough to send me flying off my board at - mph and leave an indentation in my board's steel trucks.    i got road rash all along my hands and arms, for which some small scars still remain. my wrist still hurts when it's cold or when i hold my cellphone in an awkward position, e.g. texting while charging (which never used to be bother my wrist before). i had to take a few weeks off from the gym, but i did get an xray and my doctor didn't see a fracture and referred me to a specialist, but i haven't been able to go. some of my property was damaged in the crash, like the backpack i landed on which was ripped. i talked with my university's ""risk management"" department and they offered me only $ compensation for all this, which i thought was low to waive all of my rights regarding the matter. i think i'm going to go to small claim's court and ask for $-k, so a judge can help us reach a more fair solution. is it feasible to do this on one's own? is this amount reasonable? is a lawyer necessary and would it make financial sense to get one for this purpose?"

i knew nothing about punk rock but these guys did and they were cool and fun to hang out with. one of them lent me a mix tape because i had to go visit my dad and had to take a greyhound. i was stuck next to some  pound redneck who slept the entire time while i listened to this new music on my shitty walkman.

[here]( are some pictures of the motherboard. four years ago i got an off-brand electric skateboard with two belt motors. there was this specific bump on the road that would hit the bottom of the board when i would ride over it. sometimes it would hit this bump and then turn off suddenly. but one time it hit the bump and it shot forward under my feet at full speed. i never got on it again. is there any hope of fixing it and making it safe enough to use?

"rocket punch! - every time errok takes his gauntlet off - it’s vulnerable. it’s high time to teach him why. whilst he’s using his extendo-fist, marissa launches frags at him with an explosion. these will hook inside the gauntlet itself, before shooting it out of his grasp at a pow. he’ll be forced to chase after it, but every time his arms close in, an explosion will send them flying away, making him look like a silly goon! every second he spends with his arm uncovered is one that’s taken from his three minute time limit. once marissa has had her fun, she sends the rocket fist careening right through lomo’s chest, letting errok fish it out of the corpse."
"although their sense of balance had been trained by years of flying,  french airmen recently found cycle skating was more difficult than piloting an airplane when they took part in a race in paris. many accidents resulted, although all of the fliers were ardent bicycle riders who, despite their air duties, have never wholly forsaken their training on wheels."
"insurers don’t need much excuse not to pay out, someone using an electric scooter breaks a number of laws making them personally liable for their own losses. the scooter it’s selfie has to be taxed, insured and mot’d as they are not legal for road use they cannot be insured, you can’t tax or mot them, and the rider would probably be breaking a host of driving licence rules as well, if someone is breaking the law, riding down the path on an illegal vehicle, the insurers definitely won’t pay out. would be up to the scooter owner to challenge that and prove why the driver should pay out."

"has anyone had experience with this or other motorcycle/personal injury settlements? % sounds like a lot, but it's hard to judge when you have no idea what value a lawyer could bring. and considering % would come out of the medical bills you owe, it seems like there is some level where you'll actually get less money by having a lawyer due to contingency.  but if having a lawyer gets you significantly more money from insurance than it would be worth it. but you don't know if it's worth it until you've agreed to it."

"background - us,  y/o male, electric skateboarding accident  months ago. my butt slammed down hard into concrete while in the seated position. instantly, i began having a salty/metal taste in my mouth, leaking sensation down my throat, and was very nauseous. i've never thrown up from this nausea.i suspected i injured my tailbone badly and went to the er a few days later. ct of pelvis/lumbar revealed no issues. i complained about the constant salty/metal taste and nausea, but they said it wasn't anything to be concerned about.about a month later, i developed severe neck tenseness and nausea. i wasn't able to move my neck at all. salty/metal taste and leaking sensation continued. after a few weeks of zero improvement and being unable to move my neck, i went back to the er. ct of the cervical region revealed unusual straightening of the spine, but nothing broken. they diagnosed me with whiplash and gave me a steroid shot and referred me to an orthopedic center.i was now able to move my neck, but there was constant intense cracking and crunching with any movement. the more intense crunches seemed to break some sort of membrane, increasing the leak sensation and taste in my throat. headaches and tinnitus became more common. pain between the shoulder blades when the leak is more present.a cervical mri revealed very slight chiari malformation and a potential syrinx. another cervical and thoracic mri with contrast revealed syringomyelia in more detail - but it was quite thin and left the ortho center's neuro surgeon unimpressed - no cord expansion. he wanted me to wait six months for everything to clear up.&#xb;as the months progressed, i began developing more symptoms - facial pain, pain behind eyes, twitching and spasms in hands, arms, legs, and feet, drooping jaw, intense brain fog. the leak sensation was constant, and begged the neuro to address it. he ordered a brain mri with csf flow study, which came back fine.i decided to drop it for a while, but then the symptoms kept getting worse - developing nerve pain shooting down arms, loss of dexterity - typing difficulty at work, dropping objects.the neuro surgeon referred me to a neurologist at a different practice. he performed all the normal tests - eeg, etc  - all which came back normal. we did another cervical mri to see if the syrinx in my spinal chord had expanded - but it hadn't changed. there isn't any chord expansion.the leaking is the only thing that hasn't stopped since april. i feel it in my throat. any sort of physical activity makes it worse.the neurologist ordered a cisternogram, which is now scheduled for next week. the more research i do on this procedure, the more concerned i get that this isn't the right one. it appears to be focused on the cranial region, while my symptoms are in the cervical region. some studies online even site that it's common to develop trauma-induced csf leak in the cervical/thoracic junction.is the cisternogram comprehensive? will it show potential flow abnormalities along the entire spine and reveal leaks that aren't in the skull?would a myelogram be better?this procedure is going to cost me thousands even with insurance, and i'm concerned about the risk of the spinal tap. i just want to be sure i'm pursuing the correct option."

i just started commuting to work on my kaabo mantis base. it’s so fun. today i was almost home and this car i front of me turned without signaling. i thought i was a reasonable distance behind about ten feet. but the brakes didn’t fully stop me and i hit the back of the car maybe a bit less than  mph s. scary experience. definitely a sober reminder to practice more defensive driving on scooter. didn’t get injured just a skinned knee and some ripped pants. scooter appears to be without damage. some small scratches on one side. i hope the impact doesn’t cause problems later on. the lady who was driving was definitely on something she was really out of it. driving in a car is scary to me often enough when i encounter careless drivers. definitely going to be more cautious with following distance.

"hey guys was hoping someone here could give me some advice on my situation. around : last night i was driving to my friends house to pick up my projector i left at his. on the way there   year olds who where riding tandem on one rented electric scooter decided to not stop and pull out in front of me from a side road. the side road they came from was a giveaway, i only had seconds to respond and started breaking hard cause i knew i would hit them at this point and tried to slow my car as much as possible. on contact the girl who was riding on the pack hit my car first both landing on my bonnet and windshield smashing it to pieces. i immediately got out and made sure they where ok and pulled my car to the side. i asked if they had any injuries the boy said he was fine and the girl said she thought she was concussed. i was worried and wanted to call the police but he insisted they would be fine and get a ride to the hospital after i offered. i got his contact name and phone number and made sure it called his phone and his mates phone as well. he assured me that he would contact me today and we would sort out after they went to a&e. today i realised i actually know both of them as they are  years younger than me at my old school and the guy actually lives right across the road from my best mate. i called him to inform him it would cost £ roughly to replace the front windscreen but he accepted then declined my call then let the next one go to voicemail.  at this point i’m thinking what my next move should be i will try calling him again later but if not would i be wise to go to his house and talk to his parents instead of him cause he can’t act like an adult. or should i threaten that i could get his provisional taken off him and get a fine as your not allowed to have  people drive on one rented scooter. i was completely sober had no alcohol in my system as well. any advice is appreciated."

"electric scooters outside of recognised schemes (scooters owned by companies) are not allowed on the road, i assume from what has been said it is he own privately owned scooter, therefore he was likely breaking a number of laws before you had your accident. in this instance you would not be liable for anything you have no obligation to be paying for an illegal scooter that should not be on the road."
"not an lirr rider, but i used to ride around queens before moving to the island. i personally loved my switch from scooter to electric unicycle. it takes longer to learn, but once you get the hang of it, it's far superior. i've crashed so hard because of the tiny wheels of the scooter. my unicycle has an  inch wheel, which can go over bumps and cracks in the roads. i used to ride it  miles back and forth to work too. not a problem with the bigger battery. they also makes smaller ones that have like  inch wheels that can fit in a backpack."
i hope this doesn't lead to a crackdown on people who actually follow the laws.

"get a scooter if you want portability, prevention from theft (as long as you're willing to bring it everywhere), and haul ass up hills. hell, i bring my girlfriend on my scooter sometimes, it works pretty well, although i'm pretty sure we make other people cringe so there's that."
"also, my boss has to cover % of the electricity used in my commute lmao"
"glad you're ok op. it absolutely sucks how much damage you took, but still, it could've been much worse. your story like many others on here are absolutely priceless for new scooter users who are just starting out and just don't realise how dangerous riding can be. it's because of these posts that i got a full faced helmet on day . i've got km in and have yet to have a serious crash, but every so often, small stuff ups where i lose balance or my wheel slips under me while i'm turning (on wet pavement) continue to keep me humble."
"personally, as weird as it may be to some, everytime i go faster than i can run, i will think to myself ""if i crash here, i will be thrown at the road at this speed.. is it worth it?"". this thinking makes sure i only attempt high speeds on roads im comfy on (hence why litterally all my top speed tests are on the same stretch of road). i also always plan an 'escape route' of sorts. if there's a fence next to me? im not going fast because i dont wanna be thrown into that. if there's grass though? i can steer/jump into that if i fuck up, so i'm more comfortable pushing high speeds. i am always aware of just how dangerous it is what i'm doing, and it keeps me from getting too comfortable. and this is especially important now that i have a board that can push  mph with ease. if i had to give people a tip, its to always realize that you can crash at any moment, and to think to yourself wether or not you'll be okay if you crash. if you think you'll be fine, keep going, sure. but if you think to yourself ""i wont be okay if i fall here"", then please slow down."

"hey guys, so i was looking to buy the tynee mini  (wh battery). the problem is i travel quite often, and so taking the board with me would be an issue when i take flights. according to this site:  traveling on plane is pretty much restricted to wh batteries.i had heard from others that when they travel, specifically with the exway wave, they take out the battery and stick a label on it (ex. wh label on a wh battery) and that it has worked out for them. i really wanna carry this board with me wherever i go, but as you can see it is not so easy.i wanted to know if any of you have had any experiences traveling with big battery boards and what you've done to get past without problems. in any case, i am not very fond of the idea of breaking aviation rules, so if you have any other recommendations or proven methods to solve this problem, please do let me know."

"the bottom line is the main focus of any laws or regulations should be on actual safe riding practices, and teaching new scooter owners how to ride safety in different city environments, not on simply limiting the speed or power and thinking that will make everything super safe."

"due to flinging myself down many stairsets and ""rolling"" or""spraining"" my ankle, the ligaments are now damaged beyond repair, i really miss it but now have to live in constant fear of spraining it again (it has happened - times in the last  years)"
these scooters have no design regulations yet as the law hasn’t caught up with them. so if you’re going to ride one on the road it’s at your own risk.

"the job was in the warehouse district in north brooklyn. the warehouse itself was tucked away in the back of a complex where other warehouses were either storing lumber or manufacturing sparks. the air smelled of oil and soot and of tamales from the vendor carts packed around the gate entrance. i damn near snarled at one of the carts as i walked in, but i'd already had a bite that morning. enough to keep the hunger at bay."
"and where i lived wasn't even far from, the hospital especially where i crashed which was closer."
hey jerry i’m real sorry to hear about what happened to you. i had a scooter when i was younger and got into all sorts of trouble. the thing with traffic collisions is that they can cause damage that’s not immediately apparent and it’s important to get checked out. it will also help you with seeking damages from the driver that hit you since you’ll be able to trace your injury to the accident.
"using a skateboard design gives you more interior space, lower center of gravity, better crash structure and is modular enough to build any size vehicle. i don't think any vehicle using the set-up you've described has a shelf life longer than a few years. additional frunk space is a big seller, especially for families."

"-  wear protection.  a helmet is the minimum for either, but scooters tend to require more protection.  a faster scooter might require a full-face helmet, gloves, and armor for your body and sensitive joints (wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads).  you may not feel the need to wear good protection, but will wish you did if you ever crash and get thrown off your scooter or bike."
"plus, even if the pavement is not designated for bike use, it's pretty commonly accepted that kids are allowed to ride on the pavement, so i'd be surprised if you aren't deemed responsible if you hit a kid riding on the pavement with your car."

"i’m , ’”, , ok shape. had one standstill spill in the first week and landed on my back. i’ve dislocated both my shoulders  times (previous stuff), and tweaked my right one a little on that fall. i’d say it took maybe a week for it to feel normal again and my back maybe two weeks for it to completely stop hurting when sitting down, but i continued riding this whole time. years ago i used to wakeboard and skateboard, but was always way more careful on a skateboard because they can get out from under you so easily and you’re always on a hard surface. the onewheel isn’t like that. it’ll balance under you and hold you up with regards to front & back, but side to side is moreso directly up to you so you’ll need to develop good foot and calf muscles (worry not, riding will do this for you), keep your legs always bent a little to act as springs and develop skills slowly. always be aware of what you’re about to roll over. even small things can affect the tilt of your board and it’s better if you can anticipate them (when learning. when off road, it’ll bounce around a bit. many people lower their tire’s air pressure.) do not ride through foot fatigue until you get accustomed to moving your feet around on the pads to relieve it, get off and walk around a little. fatigued feet basically stop working and you’re asking for a crash. also, onewheels can go off road, so if you wanna learn something that you’ll fear you may fall on, try to learn it in a way where you fall into some grass. btw, bumpy grass will also slow you down and make the motor work harder, and it’s a much more intense time for your muscles, so if you end up falling a lot on grass compared to harder surfaces, that’s not too uncommon until you get used to riding on it. packed dirt is the best off road surface for riding."

"if you decide to follow my path, just make sure to spend the money on quality gear and educate yourself (youtube is fucking awesome) on how to move in traffic and minimize your risk since you no longer have a big steel box insulating you from the negative health effects of yours and others around you doing dumb shit."
"if i learned something from this, is that no matter the conditions, you can still behave like a dork sometimes so always wear your gear! i didn’t at the time of the crash (it was hung on the scooter stem) at fortunately bothing happened (good reflexes + putting your hands first)."

(some existing comments about sub-par quality and materials)flying eagle: getting increasingly popular/mentions recently, probably due to competitive price point.. heard good things..micro: some would not consider them ""reputable"", due to how it was started, skate design, etc etc.. but ethical issues aside, good things were said about the physical products themselves..roces:  og of aggressive skates, like how rollerblade is to the non-aggressive side of thingsk:disroyal:bont:razors:&#xb;&#xb;# ----------# .) choose a boot that matches your feet shape# ----------skates (like shoes) are all shaped differently.. some skates are wider, while some are narrow, as compared to their length..it is important that you choose a skate that matches your feet shape, because an ill-fitted skate would mean you have extra room at the toes or at the sides, and this will affect your skating performance and comfort.. common complaints for this is that your foot is ""moving around in the boot"", and this can cause blisters, and lack of precise skate control..&#xb; way to help identify the shape of the boot is to take out the liner of the boot, leaving just the hard shell.. put your foot in, to see if the shell is just slightly (- finger spacing) bigger than your original foot (front-back and left-right).. this way, with the liners in, the whole boot is somewhat uniformly surrounding your foot..(i'm not sure if should include brand/model information, because these will be outdated with time, i'm not knowledgeable in all models, and it's hard to keep track of all skates, but let's see how it goes) (help needed!)credits: u/no_satisfaction_, u/therazorskiss, u/mrkangtastic, u/bonefragment|narrow skates|""normal"" skates|wide skates||:-|:-|:-||rb twister||rb cruiser, rb pro||||fr series (///x) (smaller at arch area compared to rbs)||flying eagle (all models?)|flying eagle f|||roces m|| roces th element ||powerslide imperial, swell|powerslide next|powerslide zoom|||||(generally this is more for hardboots than softboots, because softboots are more forgiving due to their soft construction.. also, if you are using a softboot, chances are you are not too concerned about fit performance in the first place)# ----------# .) sizing# ----------once you found a skate that fits the shape of your feet, then we can discuss sizing..in general, we would advice new skaters to get a size that feels smaller, slightly uncomfortable (but not to the point of painful).. if you feel comfortable in your new skates, it is probably too big..this is because we would expect the liner/cushion of your skates to break in and get thinner within the first couple of weeks.. after this the cushion would have thinned out to the exact shape of your feet, and it would feel great..contrast to if you were to feel comfortable with the skates from the start, once the liner thins out after awhile, you will end up with a skate that is too big.. common complaints for this is that ""you could feel your leg moving in the skate"", and that ""blisters are developing""..most good specialized skate retailer will also give similar advice about sizing smaller, having a snug fit.. however, it is also very very common for online reviews and retailers (usually non-specialized shops) to suggest buying a comfortable / larger fit.. this is largely because a comfortable boot will most likely make people happy initially, and thus people will not ask for refunds / return product / leave bad reviews, and afterwards, no one leaves a review or asks for a refund after skating a month or so.. many many beginners end up selling their skates nd hand, and buying another skate with better fit.. so just trust this sub on this, get a smaller tighter fit, and your wallet will thank you for it.. **for skate sizing, do not rely on your usual shoe sizes in us or eu sizes.. for one, we tend to buy larger sizes for street shoes, for comfort.. secondly, those sizes can vary widely from brands to brands.. instead, measure your feet from heel to toe (in cm), and look for ""mondo point"" in the skate sizes.. this will be much more accurate than talking about us or eu, etc..**# ----------# .) frames customization# ----------frames are the part of the skates that holds the wheels, and is the part that comes out of the bottom of the boot.it is always good to have a skate that allows you to change your frames.. that is to say, you can keep your boot, buy another frame to attach to your boot, and have a totally different skating experience.. as mentioned in (.), if you found a boot that suits you and your feet, keep it!! and just change the frames.. this will allow flexibility in future (and also to save money)..there are  types of mounting systems:&#xb;>fixed (not really a mounting system)* basically you cannot change your frames, and the boot and frames comes in a single unchangeable piece.. obviously this is not recommended..* unfortunately, a majority of softboots are fixed, and lack frame changing options, so fyi* if you don't see a screw from the underside of your boot connected to the frame, chances are that you have a fixed skate this is a mounting system developed & owned by powerslide* this means only powerslide makes these frames (edit: see next point), and if you have a powerslide boot with a trinity mounting system, you can only change your frames to those made by powerslide* (edit: some rd party frame makers also make trinity frames, but the point of restricted choice still stands, versus the below  other mounting systems..)* not saying the trinity system is bad (i personally found it innovative), but if you like flexibility in changing frames, this is a point of consideration.. mounting (including ///mm)* very very common mounting adopted by many many skate brands (esp. non-aggressive skates)* as such you have many choices of frames if your skate have a mm mounting.. eg. your seba skates is able to use a rollerblade or a flying eagle frame.. (seba, rollerblade, flying eagle being different skate brands)* heel is raised / higher than the toe* most support a variety of mount distances a common mount especially for aggressive skates* practically a standard for aggressive skates and every aggressive skate makers uses ufs mounting* unlike  mounts, ufs is distinctly level on the heel and toe area notes: no single mounting is inherently better than the other.. i guess my point here is to know your options when going for a skate boot with a particular mounting system, and the flexibility of changing in the future..&#xb;# ----------# .) wheel size# ----------***(in general, for new skaters, we tend to advice not going for a larger wheel size (more than mm), because it's harder to learn on.. learning skating is hard enough, a beginner don't need the extra balance difficulty to deal with.. mm wheels is a common start for beginners..)***there are pros and cons to larger / smaller wheel sizes, and you should make a choice based on the type of skating you do.. refer back to section (.) where we talked about the different types of skates and the wheels sizes commonly used..pros for larger wheel sizes:* better ability to roll over obstacles (pebbles, cracks, humps, etc)* higher top speedcons for larger wheel sizes:* harder to accelerate* higher skate height, due to larger wheels.. leads to harder on balance, especially for beginners..* larger wheels usually cost moreagain, relate back to your purpose of skating.. for eg, this is why aggressive skating usually have small wheels, because it is good for balance, and  ""top speed"" & ""rolling over obstacles"" are both not an issue for aggressive skaters (mainly staying at one spot, doing jumps on railings, etc)..(note: the size of your wheels does not affect stability!! see next section..)&#xb;# ----------# .) frame / wheel base length (stability vs maneuverability)# ----------***(for new skaters buying your first skate, this section might be irrelevant, as decisions on wheel base length only comes when you are changing / experimenting with your frames, which is not something a beginner will consider initially..)***your skating wheel base is the length of your wheels touching the floor.. for most cases, this is the distance of your st wheel to your last wheel, assuming all of your wheels touches the floor (ie. flat setup)..generally, the longer your wheel base, the more stable you are.. just imagine your feet glued to a long pole extending in front and behind of you, it is unlikely you will fall forwards or backwards.. conversely, if your wheel base is short, your stable area is small, and you will be less stable..however, stability and maneuverability is often directly opposite with one another.. again, just imagine the same long pole glued to your feet, most likely you can't turn very well.. with a short wheel base, skaters are less stable, but are more agile and able to make tight turns, and do tricks..larger wheels are often confused with stability, but it is not the case.. larger wheels may often result in longer wheel base, and that's where the stability come from.. as a counter example, just  large wheels may have a shorter wheel base than, say,  smaller wheels, and this larger wheel setup would be less stable and more maneuverable than the smaller wheel setup..&#xb;# ----------# .) flat vs rockered# ----------***(in general, for new skaters, we tend to advice going for a flat setup, because it's easier to learn on.. a rockered setup usually is a decision for more experienced skaters, and relates to doing tricks and maneuvers..)***in the previous section, we mentioned that all wheels touching the floor is a flat setup.. a rockered setup is when not all the wheels are touching the floor at the same time..this could be achieved by specially made frames, or simply buying different size wheels.. purpose for rockered setup is so that we reduce our wheel base (distance of wheels touching the floor).. this is to give us maneuverability, while sacrificing stability.. however, once the skates ""tip over"" from the center base, it rest on another base (eg. the front  wheels), thus not totally falling over, and having some semblance of ""stability"" within the length of the frame..there are various rocker setups, and the recent wizard trend is essentially a rockered setup on a long frame..  the nn frame makers have a very good write up on this, with many pictures explaining the concept.. [ ----------# .) bearings# ----------lastly, we have bearings, being the least of our considerations when buying skates.. the reason for this is because bearings are meant to be perishable (as with the wheels themselves).. they are meant to be used and replaced constantly, as long as we skate.. they get rusty when in contact with rain / water, and they will get dirty over time.. so even if you got a good / bad set of bearings that comes with your skate purchase, they will only last till the next time you change them.. (of course, its good to have ""good"" bearings, but they shouldn't be any deal-breaker of sorts)..then there is the issue of ""good"" bearings.. several skaters (including myself) do not think there is any difference in real-life skating experience between cheap vs expensive bearings.. there is an abec rating system for bearings, but it applies more towards industrial applications with high loads and high rotations, rather than our small load low rotation skating, so it's all marketing stuff and means nothing in reality.. however, there are also people who swears by certain bearings brands, and professed being able to tell the difference when skating, so there are differing opinions on this..on the maintenance of bearings, again, there are two camps on this.. on one side, we have skaters who feels it's not worth cleaning the bearings, and would just throw them out and replace with new ones when required.. on the other hand, there are skaters who would do regular cleaning and lubrication on their bearings to prolong their life..there are several kinds of bearings, and all of them will work, as long as the size is correct.. skates all uses the  bearings, so you can't go wrong buying  bearings.. there is -zz, -rs,-rs, but they basically differs in the shield cover of the bearings (again, all will work).. there is also ceramic, stainless steel, etc, different materials, which provides different levels of protection against rain / rust..ultimately, opinions on bearings are rather divided, so new skaters could simply just experiment themselves, and come to their own conclusions.. as mentioned, the worse that one could end up is a lousy set of bearings, and it's rather easy and cheap to change it (as compared to the other parts mentioned above)..&#xb;# ----------# section  - protection# ----------for beginners, protection is something that is practically essential in skating (and this applies to advanced skaters as well).. falling is something that will happen frequently, and you need protection to reduce damage to your body, and mental state, while learning.. the more you can reduce the toil on every fall, the more you can continue learning / stay motivated..(also, you would likely progress faster if you are less afraid to fall.. some skating instructors actually get students to fall purposely, so that they get used to falling, which any beginners will be doing very frequently, with protection or not..)below are the commonly mentioned protection that people use.. i would not necessary advice having everything, but it would be good to learn with as much as possible first, then adjust as your skill / comfort level / falling technique improves..&#xb;>helmetprotecting your head is very important, and it is advisable to wear one even if you are an advanced skater.. one wrong fall, and people do get paralyzed from head injuries.. this is especially so if you are into aggressive skating.. this is legit a life-saving protection..important to note that you need a helmet that protects the back of your head.. this is why cycling helmets are not good, as they generally do not have back of head coverage.. refer to this if you want to learn more about the differences: [ & knee & elbow  >  >(i'm putting them together because they usually come / sold in a set)..the wrist & knee & elbow are  most common parts our human body tend to naturally use to contact the ground when we fall.. as we fall while skating, we are likely falling while having some forward momentum, thus most of the damage comes from our skin being rubbed / dragged across the floor, rather than the downward impact..the general idea for these is to take / promote ""sliding damage"".. thus, it is important that we get these protection with hard shell, and not just a soft cushion-y pad.. the hard shell is meant to slide across the floor, redirecting your impact horizontally..(of course, most of such protection also comes with a soft padding inside to absorb impact, which is good).. the point is to not just have a soft cushion-type for these  parts.. pants / crash pantsunlike the ""wrist knee elbow"" protection, these are meant to directly absorb the impact on your bum / tail bone / hip bone when you fall on these parts (usually when falling backwards).. thus, these are usually thicker, and without the hard shell mentioned above.. there are a variety of protection coverage, but generally we don't need much protection / padding at the front (groin) cuz it's unlikely we fall front on the groin (we have the wrist, elbow and knees)..&#xb; mentioned, most skaters would reduce the level protection as they get better, and this is also related to the type of skating you do.. certain type of skating have higher risk of falling in a certain way / body part.. but regardless, it is highly recommended to at least have a helmet on, as head injuries are no joke, while the injuries to other body parts are less life threatening..&#xb;# ----------# section  - troubleshooting issues with skates# ----------&#xb;>**""getting blisters in the same place""**  >  >credits: u/zadak_leader* if in the inside foot area, check if you have an accessory navicular bone (this thing is not widely known about yet, and can save you a lot of pain). solution: use a heat gun to ""punch out"" the boot padding/area (e.g. [ for blisters in general, found out that there is an anti-blister stick from compeed [ it actually works well!* gel heels/inserts, myfit footies, donut foam pads, moleskin tape. all of this should be part of your arsenal in treating various pressure points&#xb;>**""already bought / own oversized skates""**  >  >**""skates broken in and got too thin""**main problem is that we have too much space in the boot, so we need to take up the space to solve the problem:* general looseness ($$ solution): buy a new liner that is known to be thicker.. known thick liners: myfit fatboy, myfit crown.. known thin liners (fyi): intuition, myfit nd skin, reign v* general looseness (diy): adding sole inserts, wearing thicker socks, wearing extra socks* looseness at the heel / toe: cut up socks for targeted padding at the specific area.. paid solutions includes ankle guards, toe guards and powerslide myfit footie..(more troubleshooting issues to be added in future)# ----------# section  - wheel rotation# ----------why?as we skate, the wheels on our feet will get worn out, and depending on a variety of factors (type of skating, skating posture, breaking methods, etc etc), different wheels will get worn out differently..(factor ) most commonly, the inside edge and outside edge of the wheels will be worn out at different rates.. this can be easily observed by the developing slant in the angle of the wheels.. in this picture below, it is obvious that the lower part is being worn out more than the upper part.. as the wear develops more, the contact point of the wheels and the ground will be shifted away from the center line, and it will affect your skating balance.. ) also, another factor is that individual wheels themselves receives different skating pressures.. for example, those skating forwards may tend to see that their back wheels wearing out more, due to how power is generated from the heel.. thus, as time goes by, the back wheels will get smaller, compared to the front / middle wheels..&#xb;solution? rotate your wheels! rotating our wheels, our aim is to ""even out"" the wear on all the wheels, so that these wheels can last us longer, and providing a more even experience..a very common question is ""when"" should you rotate your wheels.. this is largely dependent on how frequent you skate and the type of skating you do.. there is no hard and fast rule to this.. however, if you can visually see the uneven wear developing, or worse still, feel it while skating, then it is time to rotate them..here is one arrangement to how you can rotate the wheels.. the intention is to both switch the sides of the wheels facing outwards (factor ), and to shift the position of the wheels around (factor )..[refer to  .. recommended for worn side to face out, as it is usually the inside that gets worn more..]( do note that this is just a starting point for who are unsure what to do.. it is likely that as the more you do this, the more you are familiar with how your wheels wear down (different skaters have different wear patterns), and you would develop your own rotating arrangements which would work better for you.. tldr: every skater is different!!also, it is likely that you might intentionally want to purposely wear down certain wheels to be smaller than the other wheels, and keep them that way.. (refer to ""rockering"" above).. as such you may want to rotate/flip the wheels in place, and not shift their position.. case in point, here are  videos for tri-skates rotation:* by powerslide: [youtube video]( results in a more rockered wheel wear, as the middle wheel is kept in the middle.. (usually middle wheels receive the least wear, and this rotation will further add to the difference in wheel wear)* by rollerblade: [youtube video]( results in a more even / flat wheel wear (pattern similar to the -wheel graphic above)&#xb;# ----------# closing# ----------i hope this post helps any beginners who are confused with the various skate options.. feel free to link this post frequently to any new skaters asking the relevant questions in the q&a thread..again, i'm sure there are things that could be added to make this better / more complete / more correct.. do feel free to comment and suggest edits.. thanks!!"

"two nights ago me my girlfriend and two of her friends all hung out, let’s call them sarah and zendaya. the plan was, . take shrooms and . watch night at the museum. we had shroom gummies, we are all very familiar with these except sarah, i took , which in my past experiences is a very manageable dose, i went to the movie theaters on  before, we all started trippin everyone is laughing, sarah and zendaya are getting a little touchy with each other sarah starts getting touchy with my girlfriend, but i don’t really mind it’s playful and she’s never done shrooms before, i started to get super introspective got a little emotional, because i have a lot going on in life right now i was also overwhelmed, and very introverted, consumed by thoughts. about  minutes go by and around this time sarah is tripping hard, she climbs out of the window onto the roof above the community area above the alley and starts saying “i’m a gremlin” super loud i’m a creep voice and starts scurrying around the roof and throughout the building(my girlfriend lives in a huge empty hostile shaped like a u, with + rooms two story’s and a alley in between the u all to her and her moms self, anyways i start to get overwhelmed grab my skateboard phone and hit the city because i didn’t want to deal with everything while having a not so good trip. i start walking and find myself having trouble with accepting reality, i come to the conclusion i want to “feel alive” as well as having an intense desire to talk to someone sober, i call my brother and we talk for about  minutes as i walk up this super steep road. i get to the top and tell my brother “ i want to feel alive, i’m gonna bomb this hill” he gives me words of encouragement and i start heading down this hill.(i crashed bombing a hill at about mph  years ago, snapped my arm broke my shoulder messed up my knee caps and cracked my head open, i still need surgery on my shoulder because it didn’t finish healing naturally so it needs to be screwed together) i start cursing down the street and i feel great, i feel as one with everything the flow is amazing, as i’m flowing with life i suddenly start to get concerned about speed and the shakes i feel on the bored, i start to pay more attention and i realize i’m going around mph, i realize if i’m gonna slow down i better do it now, i get scared and freeze up, i have gone down about two more blocks now and i think i’m in the high ’s maybe ’s (i am blowing past cars going - and i accepted i might die, there was no going back and i had to grow some balls, focus and try not to fuck up, i am trying to focus on the road and make sure i don’t hit any rocks because if i do i will literally go flying and might die, as i’m doing this the light in front of me turns red and cars start going across the intersection, i try to sway to slow down a lil but when i attempt the back part of my skateboard almost fishtailed and sent me flying, so i decided i just have to hope i dont get hit by a car, i am mentally timing when i will hit the intersection and where the cars will be when i do, i calm down because it looks like i will hit an empty pocket this ends up being the case i calm down slightly and as i’m going down the next block my light turns red again, and i’m trying to time the cars and when i hit the intersection once again but this time in my head i will hit the intersection the same time as this car and i’m gonna die, i accepted there was nothing i could do and just had to hope for the best, as i go through the intersection i miss the car i thought i would hit but the car directly behind it misses me by inches, at most a foot, as soon as i got through that i felt my body deflate, my shoulder felt light and the sharp stabbing sensation in my chest disappeared but than the relief was gone instantly when i realized if i crash going  on this street with no protection i will still probably die, i focus, go down two more blocks a parking lot  and slow down on the main street that is empty at this time. i get off my bored walk to a rock sit for min gather my thoughts think about how dumb and selfish that was, how much pain that would cause my family if i died, than decided to walk back, i walk back and want to share what happened, it was one of the more crazy experiences i’ve had in my life and definitely the craziest shit i’ve done in the last  years, i felt like i had to tell the world, but everyone is trippin and nobody is listening to me so i leave again because it was stressful and i didn’t want to force the situation, i go outside and sit in front of the building on my bored on the side walk, i’m talking to my brother on the phone when  weird drunk guys are talking loud and seem super sketch, i put the phone down and i hear them attempt to whisper about jumping me, i get off the phone stand up, as they approach i say “ what’s up” than they start asking me where is a good place to party down here, i say i wouldn’t know and start to walk away, they walk away but than separate and start to circle back around from all angles, i decided fuck this i’m going back inside, i go inside and after about min my girlfriend and the two girls decided to go to mcdonald’s , my girl and zendaya are walking down and sarah is following behind them, they make it to the bottom of the stares when sarah as she approaches the stairs puts her hands on my chest pushes me around the corner puts her lips to my ear and says “i ate  yummy treats” she than takes a step back giggles, slaps the shit out of me and proceeds to bark  times at me like a dog, and than walks down the stairs.. at this point i’m just like why tf did indo this lol, i go to the bathroom, sit and chill for a bit, go back outside and smoke, apparently while smoking sarah got picked up by her friend at mcdonalds, and only my girl and zendaya where still sleeping over, we all go upstairs watch the movie zendaya leaves and i get to sleep peacefully with my girl."

"marissa’s initial goals are twofold! first, she’s gonna run around as much as possible to spread her footstep mines. as she builds up speed, she’ll eventually reach a point where she doesn’t even need to exert her muscles, letting blastforce steer her body. as she’s running, black moon partially summons its arms from her body, scraping them along walls, pews, or whatever the fuck it can grab ahold of, to plant charge above the ground. moon blasts chunks of wall into its hands, which can create pressure charged grenades that it can lob wherever it wants throughout the map! coverage is king. the sheer volume of footstep and other mines should compensate for her s time limit; marissa should always have frags available to control."
"i was at a store like hot topic or something and they were showing some really slow motion videos of some... seemingly extremely painful... skateboarding accidents.  it's really surreal to watch, and i want to see if i can buy those videos and ""experience them in my own home"" (if you know what i mean).so, what should i google for?  please just tell me what to type.example [here]( i mean professionally produced dvd's, not just some random kid on youtube.  i need multiple tens of minutes of accidents."

"others in my area were frequently hit, some killed, it was scarily common. i believe their thought process is they want hurt you bad enough you will never want to ride a bicycle/scooter/skateboard again and get a car instead, if not your death is an entirely acceptable option. the logic being 'if you had a car you wouldn't have gotten hit, or rather i wouldn't have had to run you over, so it's your own fault.' unless a street is completely devoid of cars i'll gladly take the sidewalk, even with all the cracks that have caused me a few spills. i never hit or was a danger to anyone."
"i’ll explain why. lechoke was responsible for the holocaust, the armenian genocide, ww, the korean war, the vietnam war, /, the arab spring, the crusades, the islamic invasion of spain, the formation of israel, he was also responsible for driving the jews out of israel in the first place,in fact the egyptians did nothing wrong; it was lefraud who was responsible for enslaving the jews. lemickey is secretly a scaly and one day while he was wearing his snake suit he tricked eve and told her to eat the apple. he also killed abel. he also lead the mongol invasions of everywhere. and the hun invasions. and the mughal invasions of india. and the viking invasions.leleven was the guy who started colonialism(only the invading part not the part where they provided technology and medicine to the natives). after lebum tested positive for covid, he spit on native americans, nearly driving them extinct. lefrozenone also killed all the dinosaurs. he was also behind the bronze age collapse. leragequit single-handedly did the triangular slave trade; hell he was the guy lebron bought the slaves from. legay also beheaded a french teacher for disrespecting mohammad, and blamed it on wholesome muslimerinos. all the blood diamonds are produced by lecarried. he was the guy who cut congolese workers hands off because they did not meet his supply. lenorings chased kyyle rittenhouse in kenosha with a skateboard and beat him up and snatched his rifle, and used it to kill jacob blake. during the blm protests le-- was the one who looted and burned all the stores. even during the charolletsville incident, they were all shadow-clones of lebum. leracist did pearl harbor and bombed hiroshima and nagasaki. leringchaser was the mastermind of the holodomor, the great leap forward, east germany and every time a tankie screams ""it was not real communism"", lebron was involved. leinsane grilled the last dodo. leterrorist shoots palestinian kids for fun and shoots missiles at israeli civilians. he was the guy who killed all those rohingyas, and uyghurs. he was also involved the current hong kong situation; so much involved that he was the one who sold opium to the chinese because he has no spine. the irish potato famine, africa, the bengal famine; all because of lechina. leownedbysuns commits human rights violations on north korean citizens everyday. al qaeda, mujaheddin, boko-haram, taliban; lesheep. he also killed the prophet of the wholesome  muslimerinos, sulemani; in a missile strike. he also did the rape of nanjing and it was lerapist who ordered and supplied all the korean comfort women. ledisney personally snitched on anne frank to lefrozenone. the jim crow laws were passed by lestatpad, as well as the war on drugs. the partition of india was lesitoutgamesagainstgoodteams fault, as well as the resulting kashmir issue. he also starred in the cuban missile crisis and started the cold war. during the russian revolution, the peasants understood that nikolai ii's family was innocent, and would offer them a chance to leave, but lemurderer massacred them. he tried his best but failed in preventing the american and french revolutions, but he got back at them by causing the reign of terror. lesnitch tortured louis xvi's son and forced him into saying that he had sex with his mother and aunt, and promptly guillotined them. lefailure invented pineapple-pizza and tofu-chicken. he was the guy who snitched on alan turing, revealing that he was gay. the judge felt that such a respected professor could be sent away with a slap on the wrist, but lerigger rigged the jury and sentenced him to hormonal therapy. lestripxkub rigged the new york stock exchange and caused the great depression. in the town of waco, he raped a woman, blamed it on a black man and lynched him by burning him alive. he was the leader of the khmer rouge and wrote the plot for star wars: the force awakens. despite making up only .e- % of the population lebron james commits % of the crimes. ledictator also was the dictator of uganda. lefaker regularly kills journalists and opposition leaders in russia. he was behind princess diana's car crash. lemagic fucked a monkey and started the aids pandemic. he started coronavirus and ebola and the black death and the spanish flu and the bubonic plague and the syphillis outbreak and the trojan war and tthe bush war and the fall of rome and the dark ages. after taking a dump, leshit leaves his toilet paper like this. lecovid burned down the notre dame, and knelled on george floyds neck. he also was the guy who sold drugs to george floyd. lecrybaby is the reason i am the only person in my class who doesn't have a girlfriend. lepeds is the reason why the armenia azerbaijan crisis is even there."
i'm still training my muscle memory to lean back and squat low while breaking to add to keeping the rear tire on the ground for the inevitable time when i'm going to have to break as fast as possible.

"however, if i were in her position advertising, i’d want to be a lot clearer about this. i get not wanting to say too much about your disability in advance thinking it may put people off, but the way this is written with the injury prominently mentioned at the start, i think lots of people reading it would also be put off as they may assume the level of impairment to be worse than in reality - thinking that if e.g. you could manage stairs, you’d probably say that, so not saying it means you probably can’t."

the child was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. police have area streets closed while the crash is being investigated.

"i was a teen in the early ’s, spent so much time tearing around on a skateboard listening to ratm (& saw em a few times live… fuck im old 😂"
rentable scooters are convenient but they would be much less so if i had to carry a helmet around to ride one. people are obviously responsible for themselves but i feel like ones that anyone can ride inevitably lead to more injuries.

"i broke my ankle on / and had surgery /. for me, the pain was worse for the first week after surgery- worse than the day after the injury. almost exactly  days out from the surgery the pain really changed. it can still be quite painful sometimes, but it hasn’t woken me up at night in the last few days and it’s not as sharp and intense. so, my experience is that the worst phase of the pain lasts for about a week and a half. you won’t feel the level of pain you feel now forever. it still sucks, but i’ve been way less depressed about it since i started feeling less pain. also, ice helps! i felt at first like it didn’t matter since i don’t feel it super strongly through my splint, but it definitely makes a different in the pain levels."

so a few years ago clash was the last operator to be added when i was playing this game religiously i climbed from bronze calibration (solo queues) and got to the final platform of gold and then i stopped playing for some reason i can’t remember. fast forward to  i came back i thought back to my previous time in the game where i’d have a positive kd ratio every game and would win four times out of five but it wasn’t happening. i can barely get three kills per match now an average of five deaths and all of my calibration games (solo queue) were losses and filled with negative toxic people. i feel like the main reason i’m doing so bad is due to a scooter injury i suffered in  i fell off my scooter when an object hit me in the eye (i believe it was grit from a road) and i landed pretty well due to safety position but i slammed my left hand on the ground as i fell and there was no damage to bones or muscle but the doctor believed there could be long time nerve damage in the underlining soft tissue. i feel it on rainbow  i feel so pathetic because my left-hand doesn’t function as well anymore i can’t lean fast anymore and my fingers lock up when trying to lean/crouch etc so my gun fights are usually losses now even if i aim for the head. is there anything i could use to try and get around this? i feel so bad at the game. some kind person suggested foot pedals or mapping my lean keys to my mouse and shoot onto my keyboard.i tried cod warzone and i go on massive killsprees but i want to play a proper game and i feel like i can’t anymore.hell i’m silver  currently but if i could go back to the final tier of gold like i did every other season i’d be happy.

"incidentally, i dont feel like surfing was as good at rehabbing my ankle. i strongly feel like there’s something about what’s required of the board foot when pushing a skateboard that really maximizes the use of everything in there. plus, its harder to switch stance in surfing so neither ankle is being exposed to every scenario."

"the only warning i'd give anyone about using a wheelchair/scooter, is that while it's great to avoid boom and bust cycles, try to make sure you are still doing whatever walking you can (emphasis on whatever you can- no forced walking) without crashing. before i got my scooter i used to do occasional walking (literally a few minutes here and there), it wasn't sustainable and i could walk so little i couldn't really get anywhere, but the alternative was staying in the house. when you get a chair you can get pretty much anywhere without walking at all, which is amazing and freeing. however, fitness does decline quite quickly, so when i first got my scooter i did notice a period where my actual fitness and strength felt lower. hard to tell if it was just my condition getting worse as my fitness did improve eventually which took very minimal strength/fitness exercises, and it might have been caused by something different, like changes in medication during that time. however, i believe that while people with cfs can to some extent gradually improve their baseline by very carefully reducing sensitivity to certain tasks, i also think that we can to some extent reduce our baseline if we completely eliminate certain tasks that we could manage beforehand."

captain crunch**anna  sets up the drug deal between eric and the commandos. she calls eric  and tells him where to meet (this is the text she had sent earlier to  the commandos). you can drive there as either eric (with bear and mickey in the car) or as anna by herself. the three boys pull into a parking lot. anna brings a sniper and an assault rifle to a vantage point over  the parking lot. the commandos roll up in three humvees, each with  passengers. they found out through social media that the dealers had  been wiped out and they were probably being set up. they open fire on  arrival. you can play as anna or eric, but eric and the homies are  taking cover behind their car. they don’t have the firepower the  commandos are armed with. anna uses her bionic eye to identify one of  the commando captains. she also sends a picture of him to eric. you have to make sure the captain stays alive to pass the mission. two or three  more humvees roll up on the parking lot and you have to kill them too  (without killing the captain).**cutscene:**anna  shoves the captain in her trunk. she apologizes to the boys for walking  them into a setup. the mission ends with you controlling eric, who now  has to drive his friends back to the club.**mission complete****mission  -

escaped prisoner # - earl meyers**escaped prisoner # is a famous meth cook. his special, flavored meth has been  popping up around lake miarce. using the stealth chopper first seen in  mission , anna uses her bionic eye’s heat vision function to look for  glowing objects in the middle of the woods. you see a few funny things  like a guy fucking a doll, a dude who shoots his friend with a shotgun, multiple people going to the bathroom, then, eventually, you see a few  armed men standing near “hot” ventilation ducts in the middle of the  woods. the armed men spot the helicopter and open fire. you can take them out with a sniper or with a heavy machine gun. a convoy of three  vehicles pops out of a covered garage and speeds away. anna tells the  pilot to follow the convoy. as he is turning the helicopter, he is shot  through the back of his head. the helicopter spins until anna takes the controls. you have to follow the meth cook. you weave between trees and  telephone poles to keep him in sight. you can lock onto the cars with homing launchers but you only have a few and the trees and hard turns  make it difficult. you can kill the meth cook and end the mission right  there or try to take him alive. shooting close to him will cause his car  to roll and you can land the helicopter, beat him up, and arrest him.  you throw him into the chopper and bring him to carcer state  penitentiary. he isn’t gagged in the helicopter and he begs anna to let  him go. he offers anna more meth than she could smoke in  years.  anna asks him if he knows anything about the kingpin, but he just gets  angry and screams that he is the danger. he is the one who hocks. then he hocks a loogie at you.after dropping off (or killing) the prisoner, you are prompted to return the helicopter to the fib headquarters in capital city.**cutscene:**anna enters her office. fib agents are busy working. they all stop, look up, and quietly nod at anna as she passes them on her way towards her large, corner office. there we are introduced to anna’s assistant  face-to-face for the first time. they are a young and focused “hacker  type” always trying (and failing) to crack funny jokes. the assistant  projects a map onto the wall with a list of  convicts and their known  or suspected locations.  of these names are marked either “captured”  or “deceased.” the other  names are marked “missing,” including # on  the list, maceo brown aka the kingpin. your assistant marks earl meyer,  the meth cook, as either “captured” or “deceased.”\*after  you complete mission , all the other escaped prisoner missions open up. at any time you can go up to your assistant (or call them), and hunt  down one of the  escaped prisoners from the list (the kingpin isn’t  an option).**mission  - family ties**the  pitcrew calls eric to tell him they have been banned from the o-town  speedway for selling drugs. they want help taking control of o-town away  from the family, a street racing gang selling drugs, breaking into  houses, and hijacking layz trucks. in return, they will give eric and the homies a percentage of all the money they make in o-town. the  pitcrew tells eric about the races organized by the family. there is one tonight that takes the drivers from o-town, down through vice city, up  ocean beach, and back through o-town. there are  drivers in the race. the pitcrew is giving eric the spot in the race they paid for. although  your goal isn’t to win the race, it’s to kill four critical members of  the family. the pitcrew identifies the targets, and you have to somehow  take out those four family members before they cross the finish line. the leader of the family, who drives an old gto, is the hardest member  to catch and kill. the race does cross some train tracks though…this mission ends after you kill the fourth family member - you don’t even have to finish the race.**mission  - family matters**there  is trouble brewing within the family because nobody can agree who  should take charge after four of their high-ranking members were killed  during the last race. the pitcrew tried to step in and take over without  the help of eric and the homies, but they underestimated the strength  of the family and were all killed. one of the family lieutenants, named  tamara, calls eric and tells him the story, then offers him their spot in the next race. the race takes you across the  mile bridge, which  connects all the shells. you must win this race to pass the mission.after  you win the race, eric, mickey and bear (who were spectating) are  allowed at the family’s hangout, a strip club called skidmarks on the  northside of o-town. there you meet a guy who introduces you to the breaking and entering side missions. mickey hooks up with tamara, who is  one of the members vying for control of the gang.**mission  - all in the family**tamara  tells mickey about a truck heist they need help with. all the family  members are in on this heist. the plan is to swarm a caravan of  autonomous layz trucks with as many cars as possible to force them to  stop. just as they are unloading the trucks, the police show up and all  the cars scatter. you then have to track down two more of the members of  the family in all the chaos: tiffany and tamara - they are two women  fighting over who will lead the gang. anna and her assistant can give  you tips on evading the cops and tracking down tiffany and tamara. you  have to kill tiffany, but you have the choice of whether or not to kill  tamara. whichever decision you make, after you all regroup at skidmarks,  a new leader is chosen. eric decides this is a good moment to explain  to the new leader that he and his homies will now be the heads of the  family, and they all must give up a percentage of their earnings in  o-town. if you spared tamara, she hastily agrees with the plan. if you  killed tamara, the newly elected leader angrily denies the idea of eric  being above him in the hierarchy, so eric shoots him in the head. eric  then points to one of the only onlookers who doesn’t look terrified and  elects him the new leader.“the family tree has been cut down, and in its place, the homies will grow.” -

commandos are on the scene and they are attempting to kidnap the  president. the president was able to escape his kidnappers when the  plane crashed and is now hiding in an information booth behind the  collapsed monument. you must locate the president and get him to safety.  you vertically land the hydra on the log cabin lawn and the secret  service and commandos are already swarming you. you have to take them  all out and use your bionic eye to track the president. you get him into  a vehicle and transport him back to the fib hq.**mission complete**anna  gets a message from eric with a link to a trending video of her jumping  out of the hydra, pulling off her helmet, and capping a bunch of  commandos in slow motion.anna  also receives a message from someone identifying themselves as richard  weintraub, founder of layz. she knows him by the nickname the internet  has given him: the tiny trillionaire. he has seen the videos of her and  wants to see more of her.anna  gets a news notification on her phone about a bill that was pushed  through congress and the senate after the attack. the bill allows pawn  shops and ammunation stores to sell automatic rifles. the bill also  includes billions in funding for drone surveillance over capital city.**mission  - pocket rocket**responding  to (or ignoring) weintraub’s message prompts him to request an  afternoon of anna’s protection services while he presents one of his new  inventions. without waiting for a response, he deposits , layzer  coins in anna’s coinpurse and a mission icon appears at the lawton space  & fun center. when you arrive you see that weintraub is already  being protected by a platoon of his busty feminoid sentries. he paid  anna so she would be there to watch him show off. richard weintraub is  the trillionaire founder of layz, a delivery app that can get you  anything from a hot pizza to a busload of redheaded cheerleaders,  sometimes within minutes. he started the app when he was just , and  now,  years later, he is a trillionaire, and one of the richest people  on the planet. he is also barely  feet tall, pale, skinny, and  completely bald.an explosion of  lights and confetti goes off and a dj introduces the tiny trillionaire  to the stage. the trillionaire dances awkwardly to the music and tries  to get the members of the press to join in. they look at each other  confused and bob their heads with the music as they hold up their  cameras and microphones. two of weintraub’s sentries come out holding  chrome suitcases. he opens one of the cases and pulls out what looks  like a large shotgun with a dinner plate attached to the end of the  barrel. the crowd lurches back as he holds out the gun. he calls it the  poon. he describes it as a magnetic harpoon gun that can tether and hold  up to , pounds. he unveils a small rocket (just shorter than him)  and claims he can shoot it and reel it in after it leaves the launchpad.  he gets everybody to count down, and when they get to zero, the rocket  takes off. weintraub gives the rocket about two seconds before aiming  and shooting the poon. the plate on the end of the poon tether hits and  sticks to the rocket. the barrel dispenses a few more feet of line  before it goes taut. the tiny trillionaire only stumbles forward for a  second before regaining his balance and pulling back on the poon. the  rocket is still burning fuel but is going nowhere. the crowd applauds.  weintraub presses a button on the poon that sends an electrical current  through the line, disabling the rocket.at  that exact moment, a biplane passes by with a banner advertising an app  that can make your butthole tighter in just  minutes. the poon string  gets wrapped around the wing of the plane and the rocket shatters the  windshield. before the tiny trillionaire can let go of the poon, he is  swept away and carried through the air. the crowd gasps (and some laugh)  as the trillionaire dangles from the plane, getting lashed around by  the wind. everyone can hear his screams. the sentries point their guns  in every direction but are helpless in this situation.you  take control of anna and the game tells you to shoot the line on the  poon while the plane is flying low over the water. if you shoot the line  while the plane is too high, or while the plane is over land, richard  falls to his death and you fail the mission. after shooting the tiny  trillionaire loose, you hop on a nearby boat to go pull him out of the  water, while the media just looks on and keeps their cameras rolling.  everybody ignores the plane that has crashed into the beach in the  background. richard thanks anna weakly before being whisked away to the  hospital. the game tells you to go back and take the other chrome case  with the other poon.**mission passed**richard  messages anna later to thank her again, and to tell her he doesn't mind  that she stole the other poon. he then sends her ,, layzer coins**mission  - poon hound**anna  gives the poon to eric. eric immediately tests it on cars while riding  his skateboard. this enables you to “surf” behind vehicles. the electric  current in the tether allows you to disable some vehicles. there is  also a rag doll effect when you attach to a car and you’re not on a  board or in another vehicle (or if you fall without releasing the  trigger).eric makes a comment to  himself about finally being able to afford some of the things he has  always wanted, like a hoverboard - so a new icon shows up for a newly  opened store where you can purchase hoverboards and other customized  vehicles like rocket surfboards and “drone shoes,” which are little  helicopters that attach to your feet and let you hover off the ground.  you get on your newly purchased ride and start pooning vehicles. the  game teaches you how to attach to cars, trains, planes, boats, and any  other metal objects. once you are attached to the object, you can reel  in the line to get yourself close to it. the game also shows you how to  steal or steal from cars and trucks after pooning them and reeling  yourself in. poon yourself back to the club to complete the mission.  pooning a motorcycle and driving that back to the club cuts out the  first part of the next mission.**mission  -

captain crunch**anna sets up the drug deal between eric and the commandos. she calls eric and tells him where to meet (this is the text she had sent earlier to the commandos). you can drive there as either eric (with bear and mickey in the car) or as anna by herself. the three boys pull into a parking lot. anna brings a sniper and an assault rifle to a vantage point over the parking lot. the commandos roll up in three humvees, each with  passengers. they found out through social media that the dealers had been wiped out and they were probably being set up. they open fire on arrival. you can play as anna or eric, but eric and the homies are taking cover behind their car. they don’t have the firepower the commandos are armed with. anna uses her bionic eye to identify one of the commando captains. she also sends a picture of him to eric. you have to make sure the captain stays alive to pass the mission. two or three more humvees roll up on the parking lot and you have to kill them too (without killing the captain). **cutscene:**anna shoves the captain in her trunk. she apologizes to the boys for walking them into a setup. the mission ends with you controlling eric, who now has to drive his friends back to the club.**mission complete** **mission  - capsized**if you switched back to anna immediately after mission , she is still in the car with the commando captain in the trunk. otherwise, when you switch to anna, mission  starts with her on her boat. the commando captain is tied up and bleeding. **interrogation methods:** asking him questions, punching and kicking him, making small slices with the finger of anna’s bionic hand, holding his face to the boat's propeller, and holding his head under water. **what he knows:** the commandos were tipped off about the setup. word was the tip came down from the kingpin himself. supposedly, the kingpin also gave them the information to break out their companions back in bovine. when you try to get more information about the kingpin, you find out nobody he has ever met has seen or spoken to the kingpin personally. he and the other captains just get messages on an encrypted app called endend. you interrogate him to death trying to get more information out of him than he has. you throw the body off the boat and head back towards capital city.anna’s assistant calls and tells her they have information about one of the escaped prisoners.**mission  - escaped prisoner # - earl meyers**escaped prisoner # is a famous meth cook. his special, flavored meth has been popping up around lake miarce. using the stealth chopper first seen in mission , anna uses her bionic eye’s heat vision function to look for glowing objects in the middle of the woods. you see a few funny things like a guy fucking a doll, a dude who shoots his friend with a shotgun, multiple people going to the bathroom, then, eventually, you see a few armed men standing near “hot” ventilation ducts in the middle of the woods. the armed men spot the helicopter and open fire. you can take them out with a sniper or with a heavy machine gun. a convoy of three vehicles pops out of a covered garage and speeds away. anna tells the pilot to follow the convoy. as he is turning the helicopter, he is shot through the back of his head. the helicopter spins until anna takes the controls. you have to follow the meth cook. you weave between trees and telephone poles to keep him in sight. you can lock onto the cars with homing launchers but you only have a few and the trees and hard turns make it difficult. you can kill the meth cook and end the mission right there or try to take him alive. shooting close to him will cause his car to roll and you can land the helicopter, beat him up, and arrest him. you throw him into the chopper and bring him to carcer state penitentiary. he isn’t gagged in the helicopter and he begs anna to let him go. he offers anna more meth than she could smoke in  years. anna asks him if he knows anything about the kingpin, but he just gets angry and screams that he is the danger. he is the one who hocks. then he hocks a loogie at you.    after dropping off (or killing) the prisoner, you are prompted to return the helicopter to the fib headquarters in capital city.**cutscene:**anna enters her office. fib agents are busy working. they all stop, look up, and quietly nod at anna as she passes them on her way towards her large, corner office. there we are introduced to anna’s assistant face-to-face for the first time. they are a young and focused “hacker type” always trying (and failing) to crack funny jokes. the assistant projects a map onto the wall with a list of  convicts and their known or suspected locations.  of these names are marked either “captured” or “deceased.” the other  names are marked “missing,” including # on the list, maceo brown aka the kingpin. your assistant marks earl meyer, the meth cook, as either “captured” or “deceased.”\*after you complete mission , all the other escaped prisoner missions open up. at any time you can go up to your assistant (or call them), and hunt down one of the  escaped prisoners from the list (the kingpin isn’t an option). **mission  - family ties**the pitcrew calls eric to tell him they have been banned from the o-town speedway for selling drugs. they want help taking control of o-town away from the family, a street racing gang selling drugs, breaking into houses, and hijacking layz trucks. in return, they will give eric and the homies a percentage of all the money they make in o-town. the pitcrew tells eric about the races organized by the family. there is one tonight that takes the drivers from o-town, down through vice city, up ocean beach, and back through o-town. there are  drivers in the race. the pitcrew is giving eric the spot in the race they paid for. although your goal isn’t to win the race, it’s to kill four critical members of the family. the pitcrew identifies the targets, and you have to somehow take out those four family members before they cross the finish line. the leader of the family, who drives an old gto, is the hardest member to catch and kill. the race does cross some train tracks though…this mission ends after you kill the fourth family member - you don’t even have to finish the race.**mission  - family matters**there is trouble brewing within the family because nobody can agree who should take charge after four of their high-ranking members were killed during the last race. the pitcrew tried to step in and take over without the help of eric and the homies, but they underestimated the strength of the family and were all killed. one of the family lieutenants, named tamara, calls eric and tells him the story, then offers him their spot in the next race. the race takes you across the  mile bridge, which connects all the shells. you must win this race to pass the mission. after you win the race, eric, mickey and bear (who were spectating) are allowed at the family’s hangout, a strip club called skidmarks on the northside of o-town. there you meet a guy who introduces you to the breaking and entering side missions. mickey hooks up with tamara, who is one of the members vying for control of the gang.**mission  - all in the family**tamara tells mickey about a truck heist they need help with. all the family members are in on this heist. the plan is to swarm a caravan of autonomous layz trucks with as many cars as possible to force them to stop. just as they are unloading the trucks, the police show up and all the cars scatter. you then have to track down two more of the members of the family in all the chaos: tiffany and tamara - they are two women fighting over who will lead the gang. anna and her assistant can give you tips on evading the cops and tracking down tiffany and tamara. you have to kill tiffany, but you have the choice of whether or not to kill tamara. whichever decision you make, after you all regroup at skidmarks, a new leader is chosen. eric decides this is a good moment to explain to the new leader that he and his homies will now be the heads of the family, and they all must give up a percentage of their earnings in o-town. if you spared tamara, she hastily agrees with the plan. if you killed tamara, the newly elected leader angrily denies the idea of eric being above him in the hierarchy, so eric shoots him in the head. eric then points to one of the only onlookers who doesn’t look terrified and elects him the new leader.“the family tree has been cut down, and in its place, the homies will grow.” - bear“shut the fuck up.” - eric and mickey.**mission  -**anna meets eric and the boys at the club downtown, which is still their main headquarters. eric’s gang has started to gain some reputation around vice city. they have been dubbed “the homies,” and ever since they took out the dealers, they have controlled the entire north vice city drug game. most of the former members of the dealers have joined the homies, and will fight on your side if you get into trouble in their hoods.anna gives eric a map overlay (for his phone) showing all the gangs she is aware of and their territory. highlights where the dealer’s territory was, the snapmatic rappers’ (the island boys), as well as the family’s. you now control all these territories as the homies, and can take over other gang territories. vice city gangs labeled:. the homies. the dealers. the island boys. the family. cerdo cartel. flaming souls. beach bums. the commandosthe flaming souls biker gang is already trying to move in on some of your territory after the collapse of the family. they are trying to take over skidmarks. you have to go deal with them to protect that territory. the game explains that other gangs will periodically try to take over or retake territories.**\*at this point you can go for any of the available escaped prisoners or any of the occupied gang territory, but you can’t take over any rival gang’s hq until you finish missions related to them.****mission  - the mansplaining candidate**anna’s boss calls and asks her to lead a group of secret service pilots in a training exercise with some of the older-model hydras - the same type she flew when she was in the military. you can drive or take the helicopter on the fib hq roof out to fort daniel on the west side of the map. after brief introductions, where the pilots admit to being fans of anna, you climb into a hydra and the game teaches you how to fly the vtol hydra. you lead the  secret service pilots on an aerial tour of the entire mainland. you head south, flying extremely low over the wetlands, then down the coast towards the quagmires. anna teaches the pilots how to hover in the hydras over kraffport. the pilots get a radio transmission warning them they are in restricted epsilon airspace. the pilots continue their journey northeast across cottonmouth. you fly right through the smoke coming out of the cottonmouth metalworks. anna then demonstrates how to fly upside down over the waters of lake miarce. you can see the  jets reflected in the rippling water of the lake. anna tells the pilots over the intercom they are heading back towards fort daniel, and the group starts flying toward the setting sun. the tranquility of the sunset over the red ring mountain range is shattered by loud beeping coming through the intercom from the other jets. **cutscene:**two pilots start to yell over each other as both of their jets are hit by incoming missiles. you see the two jets collide in a ball of flames as the other two jets emerge from behind the smoke and debris. the same beeping sound is now coming from inside anna’s cockpit. anna immediately nosedives then banks around back toward lake miarce.the game instructs you to destroy the two attacking jets before heading back toward fort daniel. the pilots aren’t responding to anna cursing at them. the jets have three more missiles each and you have all four of yours. the inexperienced pilots also don’t seem to be capable of flying through the narrow canyon north of lake miarce. after downing the traitorous secret service agents, and before you can safely return to fort daniel, anna gets an emergency message over the radio warning of a suspicious aircraft flying low over capital city. you make your way back across the map and get more emergency reports over the radio. the suspicious aircraft is now attacking ground targets. just as capital city comes into view, two newer, and much faster fighter jets pass over your hydra toward what you now see is a heavy bomber aircraft, looking like it belongs to the us military, flying low and firing over the city. the faster jets launch a barrage of missiles at the target, and black smoke starts to billow out of multiple large holes in the hull. you follow the bomber as it plunges downward, taking out the large phallic monument before skidding across the log cabin lawn, leaving behind a fiery trail of dead tourists. more reports are coming in over anna’s radio and through her phone. president murry was currently holding a press conference at the phallic monument (called “the monument to all men”). reports are saying the kingpin has infiltrated the secret service - commandos are on the scene and they are attempting to kidnap the president. the president was able to escape his kidnappers when the plane crashed and is now hiding in an information booth behind the collapsed monument. you must locate the president and get him to safety. you vertically land the hydra on the log cabin lawn and the secret service and commandos are already swarming you. you have to take them all out and use your bionic eye to track the president. you get him into a vehicle and transport him back to the fib hq. **mission complete**anna gets a message from eric with a link to a trending video of her jumping out of the hydra, pulling off her helmet, and capping a bunch of commandos in slow motion.anna also receives a message from someone identifying themselves as richard weintraub, founder of layz. she knows him by the nickname the internet has given him: the tiny trillionaire. he has seen the videos of her and wants to see more of her.anna gets a news notification on her phone about a bill that was pushed through congress and the senate after the attack. the bill allows pawn shops and ammunation stores to sell automatic rifles. the bill also includes billions in funding for drone surveillance over capital city.**mission  - pocket rocket**responding to (or ignoring) weintraub’s message prompts him to request an afternoon of anna’s protection services while he presents one of his new inventions. without waiting for a response, he deposits , layzer coins in anna’s coinpurse and a mission icon appears at the lawton space & fun center. when you arrive you see that weintraub is already being protected by a platoon of his busty feminoid sentries. he paid anna so she would be there to watch him show off. richard weintraub is the trillionaire founder of layz, a delivery app that can get you anything from a hot pizza to a busload of redheaded cheerleaders, sometimes within minutes. he started the app when he was just , and now,  years later, he is a trillionaire, and one of the richest people on the planet. he is also barely  feet tall, pale, skinny, and completely bald. an explosion of lights and confetti goes off and a dj introduces the tiny trillionaire to the stage. the trillionaire dances awkwardly to the music and tries to get the members of the press to join in. they look at each other confused and bob their heads with the music as they hold up their cameras and microphones. two of weintraub’s sentries come out holding chrome suitcases. he opens one of the cases and pulls out what looks like a large shotgun with a dinner plate attached to the end of the barrel. the crowd lurches back as he holds out the gun. he calls it the poon. he describes it as a magnetic harpoon gun that can tether and hold up to , pounds. he unveils a small rocket (just shorter than him) and claims he can shoot it and reel it in after it leaves the launchpad. he gets everybody to count down, and when they get to zero, the rocket takes off. weintraub gives the rocket about two seconds before aiming and shooting the poon. the plate on the end of the poon tether hits and sticks to the rocket. the barrel dispenses a few more feet of line before it goes taut. the tiny trillionaire only stumbles forward for a second before regaining his balance and pulling back on the poon. the rocket is still burning fuel but is going nowhere. the crowd applauds. weintraub presses a button on the poon that sends an electrical current through the line, disabling the rocket. at that exact moment, a biplane passes by with a banner advertising an app that can make your butthole tighter in just  minutes. the poon string gets wrapped around the wing of the plane and the rocket shatters the windshield. before the tiny trillionaire can let go of the poon, he is swept away and carried through the air. the crowd gasps (and some laugh) as the trillionaire dangles from the plane, getting lashed around by the wind. everyone can hear his screams. the sentries point their guns in every direction but are helpless in this situation.you take control of anna and the game tells you to shoot the line on the poon while the plane is flying low over the water. if you shoot the line while the plane is too high, or while the plane is over land, richard falls to his death and you fail the mission. after shooting the tiny trillionaire loose, you hop on a nearby boat to go pull him out of the water, while the media just looks on and keeps their cameras rolling. everybody ignores the plane that has crashed into the beach in the background. richard thanks anna weakly before being whisked away to the hospital. the game tells you to go back and take the other chrome case with the other poon.**mission passed**richard messages anna later to thank her again, and to tell her he doesn't mind that she stole the other poon. he then sends her ,, layzer coins **mission  -

"had an interesting one the other day. so i have this mountain bike helmet that i wear when i ride my electric skateboard. it has a sun visor, which i had removed and lost. i was thinking about how i'd like to find it, but i actually assumed it was left in my previous apartment by accident and possibly gone for good. but later that day i was in the car and dropped my phone under the seat. i reach under the seat to get it, and boom, the visor is right there. don't know what to make of that."
first started with a longboard since that's the nicest way to go from a to b. added a regular skateboard (was a gift) and a surfskate later. doing some mild hills and pools now and pretty big distances (i think the most was km).

"scooters are portable, you can fold them up and bring them on the bus. it's raining outside and you don't want to ride home? just chuck it in your friend's trunk and get a ride. etc etc. there's just endless convenience with the reduced size. you can chuck it into an uber, bring it onto bart, into a restaurant, a shop and stow it somewhere very easily."
"it's rough, but so long as you're either willing to put up a lot of money or willing to accept shorter range/lower speed, there are options."

"as far as i know, the person that bought it didn't take care of it, because he left it out on the rain constantly, and, electronics not getting along with humidity, it ended up frying the battery controller. he had to rebuild the battery and then decided to resell it, like  or  months after he bought it from me."
"**background information*** i was born in , so i don’t know how life was in the ’s, but many reddit users in other sub-reddit said that life was simple and enjoyable.**intro*** there are very few aspects of our society that are better today in comparison to the past (such as technology, easy access to information, medical advancement, and lgbt rights). besides that, everything just goes downhill from here.**) socializing & living the moment*** the first thing that comes into my mind when i think about the past, is the simplicity of making friends. i'm aware that the social media did exist during the early 's, but people didn't use it as much ([ the process for making friend use to be as simple as having something in common with another person. since social media wasn't as popular, you had to make your own entertainment, so most of the time, that involved spending time with friends, relatives, and family; which resulted in a pretty strong community spirit. in the past, kids would either play outside or play with toys, teens would be skateboarding, and young adults would be socializing at bars or going to concerts/movies. nowadays, the only thing young people do is go to school/work, sleep, eat, and use their phones (aka waste time on social media). it doesn't help that almost all young people either have social anxiety, or have no interest in socializing. lastly, whenever you go to a concert or a vacation, the only thing people care about is either filming, or taking pictures for instagram, rather than enjoying the experience.**) unity*** in the past, two people can have different political views, but at the end of the day, they would most likely come together and get along. nowadays, if you have a certain political viewpoint that another person doesn't agree with, he/she will immediately get mad at you, cuss you out, and would no longer want to associate with you (just look at trump and biden supporters, who can't come together and get along with each other). cancel culture is really popular, and while it's good that celebrities are being held accountable, many people took this to their advantage and cancelled celebrities who have political stances that people don't agree. i've also heard of celebrities being cancelled over something that they said years ago, not acknowledging the fact that people can mentally change. something that i wish society can bring back from the mid 's to mid 's is the lack of sexism and racism. regardless of skin color, ethnicity, sex, or gender, most people would get along without any problems; and platonic relationships between people of opposite sexes use to be % normal. nowadays, if you’re a straight male, modern-day feminists and far-leftists will immediately be scared of you, and automatically hate you because you are a ""threat"" to society.**) people weren't too soft*** so i was watching the movie “soul plane” (), and a scene that i thought of is when a muslim was getting on the plane, and two security guards get on his face and one of them said “you ain’t going nowhere without us, osama!”. i found that part to be hilarious, but i'm aware that if a scene like that were to be added in a movie that would be released at this time period, that movie would be banned before it even got released. back then, people actually had a sense of humor, but now, if you make jokes about a minority or lgbt, you will immediately be cancelled (just look at dave chappelle). lastly, just recently, yellowstone nation park had been renamed to ""first people mountain"" because the name ""yellowstone"" hurt someone's feelings. **) video games, movies, music, and even treats were better*** **video games** \-> there are many console that were amazing back then, such as gameboy, nintendo ds, and the psp. however, nothing beats the ps, the best video game council of all time (this is a fact because it's the best selling council of all time). the games include residential evil, goldeneye , crash bandicoot, need for speed and burnout. ever since my father sold my ps, i haven't been playing video games very frequently, and to be honest, the wii-u, nintendo switch, and the ps- are garbage (the ps- itself is good, but the games are garbage, and sadly, the ps- isn’t even compatible with older playstation games).* **movies** \-> the good old days, when actors could have a sense of humor without being cancelled by a bunch of crybabies who are unfortunately part of my generation. also, when it comes to movies that have multiple parts, the older versions are so much better, whereas the newer ones are terrible. the best example is fast and furious, when it use to be just about street racing and action, but any f&f that came out after furious  is just a bunch of unnecessary drama with some action. lastly, i don’t understand why every single movie has to have either a gay/lesbian, or a transgender character. for example, in the new buzz lightyear movie, it turns out the he is actually gay. buzz lightyear wasn’t gay in the older movies, so i don’t understand why he needs to be gay now, like it’s okay to have some gay characters in certain movies where it makes sense, but you can’t push this down on everyones throat.* **music** \-> most of the music that i listen to are actually either from the 's, or modern music that isn't from the u.s, and the only type of american modern music that i genuinely like is deep-house. musicians aren't as talented as how they use to be, since so many singers rely on auto-tone (especially olivia rodrigo, and she is still trash even with auto-tone). rap lyrics use to make sense and have a meaning, but modern rap music is just mumbling and cursing (let's not forget the song ""gucci gang"", who has millions of views despite saying ""gucci gang"" for half of the song, and the other half is just cursing).* **treats** \-> i’m better off not having these treats around because i am trying to live a healthier life. i can’t deny that there are tons of delicious treats that no longer exist now, and will most likely be gone forever. these treats include yo-go’s, alford sour, tik-tak spearmint, hershey bits, skittles gum, skittles original with lime, hershey’s kissable, and cheeseballs. i don't really enjoy treats as much as i use to enjoy them, but then again, i’m trying to be healthier (i’m just sticking to crackers, oranges and grapes).**) simple life +  less conflict*** i'm aware that life between  -  was not easy for some, and the u.s faced a few major conflicts, such as /, the war in iraq, and the economic crisis. however, just in  to  alone, there was the assassination of a iranian military leader (which almost started a war), covid-, police brutality against black people, january  insurrection, mass inflation, more frequent mass shootings (buffalo, uvalde), the ukrainian-russian war, and the threat of rode v wade being abolished. i'm tired of having to live through so many historical events within a short time period, most of those who do pose a threat to the safety of this country and it's citizens/residents."
"hi all, so my scooter has been out of commission for a few months now. it crashed during the school year and i have not had the time nor the motivation to figure out how to fix it. my google\-fu (google searching) has had little results, most likely because i am not a mechanic.my moped was my go\-to transportation to and from my college, and it worked effectively. one day coming back from my cousins, i failed to realize how little traction two wheeled vehicles have on a freshly rained on road, and i suffered a crash. luckily, it did little damage to me, but my moped took the brunt of it.it functions normally to my knowledge (i turned it on and let it idle multiple times, engaged all the lights, throttle, ect.) no leaks, which is good, but the handle bars and the wheel are so far out of line it is almost comical. after the crash i thought i was good to go, but realized as i turned left i was still going to the right.my question is how do i fix this? i assume there is something that can be loosened to re\-align the handle bars and tires? i also have tried just using my legs and fixing it like it was a bicycle. it is hard stuck, and i put some effort into it. thank you all for your time reading this and any/all responses.[front of the scooter, you can see how it teeters to the left]( of the scooter]("
"at the gate, ask to be able to enter earlier due to your issues so you don't have to rush."
"oh yeah, perspective totally changes depending on mode of transport. i drive around too, and then pedestrians and riders drive me crazy, and of course the electric skateboard dudes. but hey, we all need to get around, and stuff happens. no matter how i travel the streets i just pretend i am invisible to everyone else and proceed accordingly. we have all kinds in the city, and everyone needs to get where they are going. ive brushed off a slight tap or scuff with another car, a few times. once had a minor accident with a cop that blew a light wo lights or siren, we simply agreed it was minor and went on our separate ways. one of the reasons i run a beater prius around town, the little cosmetic things don’t really matter, and who wants to steal it? nobody."
"we had a very progressive policy on 'special mopeds', especially electric and replacing cars. less pollution, taking up less space, fits with the dutch bike infrastructure."
"was in your position once. decided to go with a bike, it was alright, but now i got a scooter and i definitely see what i'm missing."
tldr;
"well obviously not every time donthey get prescriptions, just an example. we had a guy that called  when he missed the last bus downtown. he'd get tonthe hospital and refuse care. he lived a block away.  he did it on my shift about once a month.  i could go on for hours. went to a medicaid patient that had  electric scooters.  grandkids were play crash up derby with  of them in the back yard."
"either way, when you are in the park, if you are nervous about getting on a ride, just ask about options.  some folks can just step in and out, but they have resources for people who don't.  rides like big thunder, slinky dog, rise and ratitoullie have fold down transfer benches you can slide across into the ride. some like spaceship earth and midway mania have vehicles with a wider door so they are easier to transfer into. others still like small world, jungle cruise, kilamamjaro safaris, and grand fiesta tour have vehicles you can drive a scooter onto (have never done it with a scooter, but my chair is custom fitted, so i can do the parks in it fine) and off of.  some rides that are low down like frozen have steps they can put down for you to transfer up and outin steps instead of all at once.  even at rides without these features, like rockin' roller-coaster, cast members know how to use all these features, but often will not offer them unless you specifically ask for them so look for doors marked with a wheelchair, cutout lines on the side of vehicles, and transfer divices to the side of the exit zones and generally ask what options are available if you are nervous or unsure. the only rides you cannot transfer into without walking a significant distance are peter pan and the peoplemover.  if you need you will need any assistance getting back out or will need your mobility aid brought closer to get off, ask a cast member when you are boarding and the help will be waiting on the other side.  otherwise the only person there will be the person who has to work the controls."

"i wonder if basketball players, skater and surfers have a high incidence of this injury."
"just like you will crash on a skateboard, you will crash when skiing, etc"
"gotta hand it to jpow; popped the bubble with just the threat of rate hikes.  i think markets can settle down pretty well without a complete crash.  feels like % of the needed multiple compression is done with some names probably nearly done and others (aapl, tsla, gme, amc) needing a fair bit more work.  but all things considered, a quick repricing of markets will probably help in the long term.  a lot of stocks probably don't have much room to grow if they have to prove it with earnings and aren't getting a continually expanding p/s or p/e ratio like the last - years.  worth keeping that in mind."
notice how they don't mention his motives.. because he is radically anti-white and anti-jewish.
"there are ""no basketball"" clauses in many players contracts, where they can lose guaranteed money if they miss team events or games due to a non-football injury."
"you'll need tools for case preparation, like a tumbler (wet or dry media) to clean the cases, measuring tools (calipers, gauges) and trimming tools for cutting the cases to length. there is a lot of wiggle room here. aside from deals at garage sales, you could buy a top-of-the-line wet tumbler, or you could diy one with, like, a bucket, a skateboard, and a low-rpm electric motor. you could buy a fancy $ shell trimmer station, or a $ hand trimmer, or diy with a cut-off wheel in a dremel and a plumber's pipe deburring tool (carefully, bubba, carefully). you'll also need a primer pocket cleaner, which can be done with a small tool that costs anywhere from $-$whatever and can be found on amazon. be sure to donate to someone like fpc through the amazon smiles thingy if you go that route."
"downvote, ban, dox away. ¯_(ツ)_/¯"
"things also drastically changed for me when i got a whill ci electric scooter since i was having a hard time leaving the house on my manual wheelchair having a high injury level i wasn't very mobile. now i live by myself, walk my dog, do grocery shopping go to downtown for comedy shows, all by myself. this is a huge ego boost i even have audacity to flirt with women when i go out on my scooter😂"

dashed line. i've seen d dashed lines on speed  and that's a residential area so for sure speed limit  if not . yes both are at fault simply because driver should have seen skate boarder and should have known slow down while driving up sooner since he doesn't know if he will come out in front of him or not. drivers have responsibilities too such as being aware of their environment the most compared to a skateboard which at most could would just tap the car. the driver could accidentally kill anyone at any point if they aren't paying attention. the amount of people who have pulled out infront of me when i'm right there. the amount that pull out and then stop like deer in headlights when they realize they messed up instead of commiting and avoiding an accident. the amount of cars that have accidentally ran over bikers/cut them off and felt the need to tell the biker (bicyclist)   to look where he's going when they're the ones fucking up  drivers who are too comfortable with their vehicles. you're the people who crash the uhuals into gas pumps! you're the people who take turns too fast and end up going off the road! you're the people riding ass on the freeway in the fast lane when if anything happens to the car infront of yours you're also fucked because you wont be able to react in time. you're the lemming of the road. michael from the office captured it completely when the directions told him to drive into the lake and he did.
watch some crashes on youtube to see what happens to unprotected riders going fast when they crash.  hurts just to watch!
"the escooter trial is fucked and i'm saying that as an escooter owner. it's like cars weren't a thing in the cbd and suddenly there were hire cars for anyone to use without any experience driving. shit, when i first bought an electric scooter i went to a quiet area to practise riding so i don't crash or hurt people."
"hey everyone.i joined july last year. skateboarding injury. i was lucky my bridge survived.i digress, i had pain in my foot everyday for a year. then i tried acupuncture. the pain hasn't fully subsided but its bearable.i'd reccomend if you're struggling with pain."

"according to police, officers responded to the  block of forsythe drive for a crash involving a child on a skateboard. police said the child was riding a skateboard while holding onto a vehicle and fell."
"if you live in or near a larger city there's a chance there's a group already. try searching on facebook something like ""nyc pev"" and replace pev with electric scooter, euc, esk, onewheel, float life. until you hopefully get a hit. my local riding group is labeled as esk even though % of the active riders ride euc, and unless they're complete stick up the ass people they won't mind a scooter rider joining a group dedicated around another pev. group rides in the prime riding season are great, and being able to get out without fear of slipping on ice (had my first unicycle crash a few weeks ago after + miles due to icey back roads). i was still only riding my unreliable slower scooter until august so i only got in at the tail end of the riding season with my faster pev's. i'm already planning a few cross state, and even potentially a cross country ride for this summer"
"the defender had previously explained how he can combine his other activities with being a professional footballer, including admitting he flew to the usa in  for a business trip without coach ernesto valverde’s permission. but now a source who knows him said he had decided himself to “cancel some commitments and to prioritise things”. the same source pointed out that other players had also cancelled or postponed sponsors’ events these last weeks, although without the same spotlight that pique always attracts."

"i know this reply is a novel, and whenever i see this issue of caro writing a book called scammer that she took money for but never wrote (and won’t), i think about bk, and the  performance art installation. i’d never put the two of them even remotely in the same category, but i just can’t help but think that if caro had done something similar - or at least as clever as - bk did, it would be brilliant performance art. but she’s no bk so what could be a fascinating commentary is just a sad situation where a  year old woman can’t grow up and can’t be honest with herself that she’ll never write the book, yet delusional enough that she thinks she will."
"covid- hitting us hard, i thought why not take this as an opportunity to go for the rd option: build my own fender with a custom integrated battery pack. this would allow me to control the look, the capacity of the battery and have a fun project to work on while everyone is stuck inside."
"sure, components are re-used in various places. but if the skateboard platform was a thing, all tesla would have identical castings, batteries, suspension. especially considering the crash structure, there is just not a great way to treat the passenger compartment and chassis as interchangeable."
"those referring to the victim as ""vehicular traffic"" are clutching at straws looking for a reason to blame the victim further. the fact the dude was rolling along on his bike at walking pace contributed nothing to this incident.  this crash could have happened if the victim had been walking his bike/trolley/skateboard/pets/children. when we focus on what the victim could have done differently, incidents like these will repeat themselves forever.  when we focus on what created a situation that was dangerous, then we can act to eliminate, reduce, or otherwise address the danger."
i decide to build a skateboard.
nothing stops me riding my motorbike at mph. it's just a risk of life. why should there be something that stops me riding a pev at a certain speed. many stretches in my commute are completely mph doable safely. as in wide as fuck cycle path with really good visibility.
i am thinking of getting an electric skateboard to make my journey from a station to my home and office faster. does anyone have any recommendations on what skateboard model/brand/style works best on london streets and footpaths as well as tips on using an electric skateboard in london?
"hello, i had idea and executed very cheaply / simply. anybody can do, results are amazing and very funi have created a simple hot swappable design to convert your electric skateboard into a gokart/lugekart -- that can be made in  mins, and removed in  seconds to go back to regular skatingto see what i am talking about, check the pics and vids here really only  things needed to make this happen (besides your skateboard). hoverboard seat attachment i bought at walmart. this was $ -- it came with the seat as well as the metal part to put my foot over the board. i don't need to use any screws, because the entire thing is attached and held in place by #. x feet ractchet clamps. this alone holds the entire thing together. this with the push of a bottom comes off, and you can go back to skateboarding againi've done this to my meepo v , which was / in stability.i've done this to my meepo mini v , which is / in stablity (good for everything except if you go to fast it starts wobbling left and right nad you have to smash the brakes)my latest trial, i put two boards together (still using those  same ratchet clamps) -- , and stability is now ./. on a  mile ride, i wobbled maybe - times going max speedthis is incredible fun. i ride it on trails where people bike and run. everybody that i ride past is left either with their mouths open, a smile, or in awe as what they are seeingthe whole setup , not including the board, costs $ i understand this s very simple / basic -- i encourage others to try this, safely -- it's very fun , just be careful"
"it's not necessarily bad, but forcing you to draw insurance on every electric scooter you own is an unnecessary cost considering electric scooter riders are the less likely to survive a crash between an actual motorvehicle and a -kg, mph limited electric scooter."

"angled rails allow for more clearance on the rail or front of the board, lower center of gravity for more stability, raise the center of gravity to allow for more leverage and clearance of obstacles underneath, etc. lots of reasons to go with bent rails"

"the  is already packed with all sorts of traffic. there’s a reason you’re not suppose to have electric powered vehicles up there, yet people insist on doing it anyway. why is this? lack of empathy? or is it just that fun?"

"he shot him because he lunged for the weapon and got his hand around the muzzle, after previously expressing in explicit terms that he would kill him if he found him alone (supported by both multiple witness testimonies as well as injury patterns from his autopsy). i don’t believe there was a rock involved. the object he threw was established to have been a bag with some unclear contents if i remember correctly."
"i'm a -year old father of , and i just bought my very first skateboard three weeks ago. i've always wanted to skate but never started when i was young. always watched and enjoyed skate videos, but never quite got around to trying it out myself. but something happened during the lockdown that finally made me say screw it, i have to try and see what it's like. so after consulting a friend who skates, i bought a "" penny hybrid cruiser. i've been skating pretty much everyday since i got the board, or at least whenever family life allows me to sneak down to the parking lot around the corner. after getting over the initial hurdle of feeling stiff and old and that 'hello fellow kids'-awkwardness, i feel myself sinking into skating more and more every day. the flow, the focus, the frustration, all of it at once, so much fun.anyways, about the injury. i tried to be fancy and pick up the board by stomping on the tail, it flew up and smacked my clumsy fingers, bending my nail back. there it is, my first skateboarding injury."
if you really want to help this person repair their scooter you’re going to have to pay for it privately.

"so, i sprained my ankle really badly practising nose stall on a small ledge a while ago. after months of physiotherapy to heal/straighten my ankle i feel like i'm physically ready to skateboard again.but i don't think i'm mentally ready to try things yet. i can push around and go up and down ramps and do some kickturns, but anything apart from that (ollies, rock to fakie, nose stall, shuvit/pop shuvit) i simply can't do it due to a mental block.anyone's got any tips on overcoming the mental block of getting hurt again?thank you"

rent an electric scooter! 🛵
thanks for any advice!
"a couple of thoughts, sure."
"around that time i discovered eucs and was absolutely mesmerized and infatuated with them.  i’m not exaggerating when i say that i spent a whole month watching as many videos about as many models as i could, and every topic…”tips on how to ride”, “how to ride an euc”, “crashing on an euc”, “how to ride seated” and on and on.  there was no question in my mind at the end of that month that it was something i wanted to do and i have not regretted that decision even a little bit."
"fell off skateboard at  a slower speed and hit my elbow. no signs of inflammation or bruising. however, it still hurts and feels really uncomfortable to move it. question is how do i heal it. do i move it around more and massage it or should i stop from using that arm and relax. does anyone know from experience?"
"i was looking at the list of e-scooter injuries collected by a law firm [here]( (content warning: graphic injury photos), and i was surprised to see a whole bunch of lower leg and ankle injuries, often broken bones.is there protective gear that people recommend wearing to avoid that, like motorcycle boots or something along those lines?is this something that experienced riders know how to avoid, for example by not jumping off the e-scooter a certain way?"

"wow, i saw this story this morning. be careful when carrying your boosted scooter!i'm not a fan of such heavy scooters, but if they've got a problem with the folding mech too... that could be an issue."
"anyone notice the increase in powered scooter use, especially on sidewalks?  this is getting ridiculous.  there isn't any reason why they should be riding on the sidewalk as they take up the entire path, as well as they pose a danger to everyone in their way.  i know the bylaw is really iffy on this and enforcement is next to none, but what can we do about this?  several times i have seen them when there's a perfectly good bike lane on the road for them.  i know people want to save money commuting around, but come on!"

"i called my brother last year when he had fallen off his electric skateboard and apple alerted me. his crash helmet was nearly destroyed as he smacked it hard. he didn’t know why i was calling and was very confused as he had just come off, had concussion and needed to get checked out at a hospital. it’s a great feature."
"i’ve bought an electric scooter recently to go back and forth from work (something similar to the divvy ones, just faster). i’ve literally had people come into my lane, travelling the wrong direction, to scare me and have caused me to crash. not exactly the same, but representative of the same jackassery."

"all of this basically means, in many areas, motorcycles aren't a complete solution for most people, because part of the year, they'll feel that they need something else. (and, when we're talking about higher-speed private transportation, that means that many will get a car if they can, and you're back to square  - or worse, because now they need to store a car and a motorcycle.) it may be worth noting that the areas that are motorcycle-dominant tend to have warmer climates (avoiding winter concerns altogether), and many of them are less wealthy than, say, north america or western europe, too (so a car simply isn't an option for them), which affects all of this..."

"i finally got some riedell zones with radar s from the last fritzy’s drop to replace my jackson vistas (bont bpm wheels). i’ve skated indoors and in parking lots for most part but today i went outside and skated on the streets. it was terrifying!asphalt is a beast like no other i’ve met. i never knew that a sidewalk crack could scare me so much. you really start to realize how little people use their turn signals. and of course, there was a  year old’s birthday party going on so lots of people at the park. eventually i found spot on the road just outside the corner of the park that wasn’t quite asphalt, i’m assuming it just smoother cement. i got into a little groove and unknowingly skated for more that two hours! it was so much fun!! i really conquered some huge fears while skating out there today. i felt so much more confident than i thought i ever would on skates, even with cars and people around me. i didn’t care how silly i looked or what anyone thought (even tho a lot of people gave me a thumbs up or a “you’re doing great!”). after breaking my teeth in my skateboard injury, i never knew if i’d skate again but here i am. and it feels good."

"funny story i hit a piece of unmaintained sidewalk on an electric scooter and broke my collar bone when i hit the ground. tried to sue the city for poor maintenance (i just wanted my medical bills paid and my missed work covered, $k) and none of the lawyers in my town would take the case because they didn’t want to be known as the lawyer that sued the city and won. they all said that. supposedly it would be bad for their reputation."
long af story geez. i was wheelchair bound for  weeks then i forced myself to get around on both casts without crutches and within a month i was walking again. thankfully im still alive today to bore you all with the details.
i always see people on electric scooters going at full speed with no protection at all in very crowded areas.electric scooters should need a license because they are a motorized vehicle.they are silent and too fast to be drove without a driving license.
the main reason people are changing their rail shape is to gain something out of their board that straight rails cannot. lets take a look at wtf rails for example. the patent explains this pretty well
"americans typically eat their salad before a meal, whilst in france it’s done after."
"additionally, i attached a voltmeter to visualize the battery charge percentage while riding. this also was very handy as the onewheel app can not be used while riding: it seems that the app adds a software check that monitors the battery discharge rate, and after a few minutes, realizes that the battery doesn’t drain fast enough. this results in  another “incompatible hardware error”, which requires to restart the board. if the app isn’t opened, everything is fine as no error is detected (we can probably thank future motion for this “nice” software check)"
"and a one-block-long car-free multi-use space for play, student drop-off and pick-up, and outdoor learning outside each of new york city’s , public schools;"
"because we likely aren't doing tricks (unless you're ronnie sarmiento) or hopping staircases like traditional skating, traditional skate shoes might not always be the best fit for our use case.we ride for much longer distances and the ratio of board feel to comfort is probably going to be different for us as well. we also aren't utilizing the rubber toe cap many skate shoes have either. there's already a big culture around skate shoes but there aren't any shoes with eskating specifically in mind.so i wanted to get some information about the community's favorite shoes as well as what they think the best shoes for electric skateboarding are."
"the at fault insurer would absolutely pay out. if the electric scooter had been getting used to cross a road, you still can't just hit them because ""it shouldn't legally be there"". if a drunk driver was stopped at a red light, you can't just drive in to the back of them."
"i know, right? i had to take it when i had elbow surgery for a skateboard injury - it made me dizzy as shit, i ordered a few hundred dollars of stuff on ebay which i don’t even remember doing, and i felt like i was being rained on the whole time."
"i don't know anything about your sail design.  as a sailboarder, it seems like the sail isn't practical.  you want to be able to keep the board with you, what about the sail?  how big is your sail?  do you have to construct the sail or is it a solid piece?  if you must assemble the sail, how long does that take?  how much does it weigh?  how durable is it?  then there's the wind.  what about at night?  don't know your windy area (although it might be interesting as a sailboarder), but wind often dies in the evening and doesn't come back up until late morning.  what about variations in wind speed?  sailboarders have a quiver of sails and select the size of ""wind catcher"" (sail) based on wind speed.  gusty conditions are a struggle.  and when sailboarders fall, we splash.  when you fall, you will crash.  (back to item #).  then there's wind direction.  you cannot sail directly upwind. you can work your way up wind by tacking back and forth at an upward angle toward the wind, but it's a lot of extra distance side to side and a lot of extra time.  (google tacking).  and here's the big problem.  just because it's windy, doesn't mean wind will hit your sail.  you'll need to be in the open for that.  no buildings, no trees, no hills, etc.  for fun in open field maybe.  maybe transportation in a desert flat.  but generally, probably not.  all of that is only an extrapolation from sailboarding so i could be wrong.  the board itself may still be a fine choice for some conditions."
"what concerns myself more as a consumer of both is the ""structural pack"" and what that will exactly entail. the batteries in every ""skateboard"" ev like a tesla is already structural. your car would for sure not be crash worthy without a battery installed."
"you decide to build a car (this is a waterfall development example, what you appear to be using)."
"basically people are driving like they drive their cars at roads, chaotic, i always keep a lookout to my proximity when casually walking, but for several times now an idiot pops up on a scooter going at a accident causing speed and missed me by my fast dodging, even when seeing people they expect the walking person to evade them instead of them going slower or turning... i have skipped getting a driving license for the sole purpose for not dealing with stupid drivers and now we have them on the sidewalks.  what makes it worse is that the scooters don't make much sound which makes them even more dangerous.i am extremely frustrated, i can't even walk sidewalks feeling safe anymore, now we have to keep checking left and right like passing a road for every single step, i hope i'm not alone with my frustration here."
"hi all, i am  y/o and tried to be young this weekend, on sunday late afternoon i tried to take a ramp down with a skateboard and the board slipped from under me and i fell backwards on my hip and knee, it felt like i lost consciousness for a while as i only remember the aftermath. i now have a lump on my lower back on the side of my hip, i can walk fine. its just when i bent forward it feels like its pushing against my skin - and when i cough i have an enormous amount of pain there. it's like i can actually feel the lump then without touching it. its not very discolored literally just this lump and then pain and uncomfortability. just want to know do you think its just a bruise or should i go to a doctorasking on here because medical care in south africa is expensive and i don't want to go unless necessary."
"as much as i don't like any mandatory regulations, this is a perfect example of why all scooters should comply with a set of safety and quality standards and certificates before they can be sold. same as cars or motorcycles that need to be manufactured to strict safety standards that ensure a higher level of safety for the end customer."

"the man and woman responsible for the dog were were today jailed for a total of seven years. the court heard harrowing victim impact statements from jack's mother and father. mr lis spoke of turning to alcohol and medication and struggling to ""find a reason to get up in the morning and live another day."" he said he was ashamed his wife and children were suffering because of his ""pain and emptiness"". their full statements are here."
"“no, it’s not a hoax,” i said, “wait, don’t hang up!”"
"i can see why someone would think that having an exercise regimen will put you at risk for injury, thus defeating the point of getting healthy. before i got serious into exercise, i had this mentality. i had two coworkers who seemed to be constantly in physical therapy related to injuries incurred through their exercise activities. one was training for the iron man. every time she talked about the stress that training was doing to her body, there was a smug voice in my head that said, ""i may be a couch potato, but at least i don't have a new injury every month!"" every week this woman was either going to the doctor or to pt."
bodily integrity is not human right? can i rape you and then take your kidney?
"if you think kids being abused verbally and physically is a-okay because ""i turned out fine"" let me tell you friend, you didn't indeed turn out as ""fine"" as you think you did. also the way you insinuate that parents of other ethnicities don't care for their children, in your comment that i linked, is disgusting and so very narrow minded. get your head out of your ass and stop invalidating emotions. we get enough of that already."
"been holding / k combined nvda c, qcom c/c, amd c/c/c, aapl c, tsla c  since the big turmoil last week. today will be make or break  or k"
"all three probably. for recumbent pedal bikes, it's hard to justify spending -k on something that is purely designed to go fast in a straight line. the only reason manufacturers sell as many tt bikes as they do is triathlon, and a recumbent is kind of an even more extreme version of a tt."

"when learning, have a friend around that you can lean on to hold you up, and make sure you’re on a flat surface. this way you can focus on throttle control basics, foot position, and general balance without having to care too much about the ground throwing you off. tilted ground and water channels (dry, onewheels are not waterproof (but can be!)) are hella fun to carve around in though, but that’s like step ."
"so i started checking how far i was, and google maps had told me  minutes walking from my location to my home lol, but i felt scared that i was going to be stopped, but i was ""i bro i can't pay for something so small done to me which was just basically getting pain injections and arm wraps, like  hours ago."

"hello r/legaladvicecanada!on may th, , i was riding my electric skateboard in bc when i was struck from behind by a car. i was riding on the side of the road, straddling the shoulder line. i heard the car approaching from behind and expected her to go around, but she struck me with the right front corner of her car, knocking me off my board onto the road. thankfully, i rolled to the right and did not go underneath the vehicle. however, i did receive a sprained ankle, bruised hip and various cuts and bruises. i was unable to work as i was on crutches and was therefore off work for  weeks. my board was also almost completely destroyed. there was no damage to her vehicle. i would like to pursue retribution in the form of lost wages and compensation for my property. my question is this: how should i go about this, as e-boards are illegal in bc but it is likely she was distracted driving?"
"one of the girls from earlier in these stories came to visit vegas after being gone for a few years and came over to my house to try some shrooms.  we tripped balls all night, but i was especially in another dimension.  at some point she starts talking to me about her boyfriend and in my mental state i thought she was venting or asking my opinion about their freaky stuff so i just tell her ""it's cool, if you guys are into freaky things you shouldn't let anyone give you a hard time about it.""  the next morning when i was alone as i'm piecing my night together i realize she wasn't venting, she was telling me her bf wanted to watch a video of her getting banged by another guy and that was her original reason for coming to my house, but i was too spaced out to understand all that.  so i called her up in the morning and confirmed that i hadn't imagined it, and then invited her back over to give it a go and she recorded it for her bf to watch with her when she got home."
"that being said - this could have just as easily been a bike, someone on a skateboard or even someone running for the bus"
"this happened to me in the beginning of may. please say ""passing on your left"" and then pass when its safe."

"this is incorrect, actually. until (presumably) the new model ys coming off the line in ausitin right now, every tesla ever made carried the battery pack as cargo, not as structure. the battery pack added rigidity to the structure, but it wasn't part of the structure."
"at the brass tax, the conventional regulatory apparatuses don't work for these new categories and have to be reformed, this is inescapable. but the cynical people like at bird or uber exploit this dynamic in bad faith."
"i've been skateboarding for years and fallen off a ton, but after buying an electric skateboard i haven't crashed yet because ironically i think they are safer. mainly due to having complete control over speed via acceleration and braking."
anything else you question.
"a yes, nothing like a news story to create hysteria. wow, electric scooters have been ridden recklessly, which caused a crash. a statistic showing how scooters are far more dangerous than other  wheeled vehicles would have helped you more. what about the  year old girl who was dragged across the ground after having been hit by a cycling travelling  mph? i’m sure if that cyclist had insurance everything would have been better right?"

"hot potato! - as she runs, she’ll pull the pin from one of her grenades and toss it toward lomo as though directing him to catch it. yet she’ll accidentally throw it just short of him, letting it bounce between his legs, detonating violently behind him. right as his corpse hits the floor, she’ll make a final leap towards him so she can tackle him to the ground, launching into an epic combo-  wait. did we say corpse? right… those aren’t really going to work at the same time, are they?"
ah man you did nothing wrong. you sound like a badass manager/trainer to have.
"in my high school years i had an acl repair and meniscus removed from a skateboarding injury. fast forward + years and suddenly  week at work my knee swells and becomes extremely painful to move. i had fluid removed at the doctor and blood drawn and they had found crystals indicative of pseudo gout, but the original blood work coming back as high uric acid. i’m a relatively healthy person who doesn’t drink booze, not overweight, but do have family history of regular gout. this last month i came down with a bad chest cold and was given augmentin for antibiotics to treat it. after finishing my prescription one day after work my ankles felt like someone had taken a bat to them and the pain had progressed. i was in tears from the sensation not knowing what was going on. it dawned on me the next day when i saw my ankles were a bright red, warm to the touch with no fever that this is exactly how my knee felt with the flare up. my concern is that i understand it’s hard to diagnose gout in the first place let alone pseudogout, but are these symptoms the same with both cases? it’s been about a year since the knee incident and i’m wondering if antibiotics had a play at my flare up this time around. my question is: is there anything to help prevent pseudogout vs regular gout? my understanding is that pseudogout can be a product of trauma to a joint (my right knee) but this nd flare up was in my ankles. this has become a debilitating and frustrating process. i’m only  and have a family and house to provide for. just wondering if maybe somethings wrong on the metabolic level that has been an oversight."
can’t get better without getting on the skateboard and attempting tricks. might crash here and there but it’s a necessary step in the path to becoming a legend of the art form. an absolute visionary
i legit fucking booked it lol.
"a friend of mine ran into sammy g last night and i guess he left on a scooter. pretty cool that he seems healthy enough to at least be living life, even if he can't play. i feel like my world would be all sorts of fucked if i had that same injury."

"the oasis outback restaurant where ramos picked up the guns and ammo he purchased online is on the eastern outskirt of uvalde. however, salvador's grandparents live on the opposite side of town (the southwest area). it sounded like he didn't have any real life friends and didn't use another form of transportation like a bike or skateboard to get around (not that it would have mattered seeing that he would have had to use the us- freeway to make it to oasis), so who drove him there??i could see ramos possibly getting an uber/lyft (though idk if there are drivers out there in a more rural place like uvalde) or maybe convincing his mom or grandma to drive him there for some kind of false reason (e.g. telling them he wants to go out to eat there or is meeting up with a friend). but how did he bring his guns and all of the ammo he purchased back to his grandparents house? the ar- and ammo he left outside of his grandpa's car after he crashed looks to be in a large duffel bag and you would have to imagine all of that stuff is not only large and bulky, but heavy to carry.you would think if a family member picked him up from a well-known gun store lugging around a large black duffel bag, they might ask him questions as it would be pretty self-evident there would be some type of guns in there, but it doesn't seem like that happened"
"you die in a horrible skateboarding accident, but discover you have a rare ability...you can be seen by living people. intangible but normal looking, you try to hide your new state from your parents so as not to worry them. but keeping up the deception is hard, and the dead are everywhere. you find a new friend, an old friend, and a strange stranger. you'll have to decide whether to be honest with them, and what kind of effect that would have on their lives. written by kenneth chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)"
"i'm pretty baffled by your stance on updates though. the update i just got overnight was a recall over the playing of sounds with the pedestrian warning speaker. that was ""fixed"" on my car overnight with a software update requiring only me to click a button while i brushed my teeth. i don't see how that's not superior to a dealership software update in every possible way."
every brilliant thing:
"also, i know ebikes can be faster than  km/h, but then you need insurance and a license because they're legally a motorcycle (this is going to depend on local laws though), plus i wouldn't ride at  km/h with a puny bike helmet as my only protection in the case of a crash, i'd rather be on a scooter wearing full motorcycle gear."
"riding is optional for me; i have a car. if i wanted to maximize safety at all costs, i could drive."
"james: no, i'd already ordered one by the time they got there. dude! stop laughing! it was a harrowing experience!"
"in that instant, your fear that your friend is hurt overrides any thought about the video."
"yerevan has decent and cheap bike and electric scooter sharing systems, but don’t expect the city to have the relevant infrastructure. unfortunately, so far there’s only a handful of bike lanes downtown and they’re short. car traffic on the main roads can be quite chaotic, so it’s safer to bike/scoot on the sidewalks, just try not to crash into pedestrians and you’ll be fine."
i stick to km/h for safety reasons. mostly on bike paths too. so any faster could create very dangerous situations if i run into a situation i didn’t anticipate. and if i fall the damage becomes somewhat limited.
"i recently got in an accident that broke my exway flex deck into two. everything else works perfectly fine except the board is now split in two pieces. i'm hoping someone in this subreddit has changed the decks on their exway flex before and can walk me through how to replace the deck. as for replacement deck options? i've been doing some research online and so far, the loaded vanguard board is the closest to what my exway deck was like. except it doesn't seem to have the flares (or arches? i'm not sure what they're called) where my feet would rest on the board. i especially like that board design as it provides really good grip for manoeuvrability and turning. i'm not quite sure the loaded vanguard has this. my second issue with the vanguard is that it doesn't have the 'well' in the middle of the board that the cable runs through and im not sure how to drill it into the new board without destroying it."

"the downward tilt of these angled side rails allows for an approximately one-half inch drop in the center of gravity of the one-wheeled electric skateboard. this allows for a significant improvement in the stability and safety of the one-wheeled electric skateboard. the upward tilt then brings the front and rear bumpers back up to the same level as with the straight frame rails, thereby making the angled rails lose little to no clearance whatsoever in relation to the straight frame rails."

electric scooters are illegal.  i’d let your insurance know about the accident but it’s unlikely they’ll do anything to cover the damage to the scooter. they will cover the damage to your car though. even if you aren’t going to claim you should still let them know about the incident - you never know if something comes of it later.

i’m not sure if there’s even a law regarding these scooters but anytime one passes me on a narrow sidewalk i can’t help but think how incredibly dangerous it is for pedestrians. the riders also don’t ever yield and expect you (the walker) to move out of their way.

but it was too late.
this is the sort of behaviour legislation that purports to be about scooter safety should address. forget about restricting responsible scooter riders and punishing the whole pev community with illogical restrictions and focus instead on reducing the number of reckless riders instead that represent way more danger than any responsible rider on an unlimited scooter ever will.

"same thing my dad does whenever we go skating, he doesn't bring his board bc he feels like having an electric scooter pull him along is easier post car accident, yet every time i mess up a trick, he grabs my board and gets on, fucks up or completely nails the trick, and says ""like that"""
in my town as we have a good cycle path network there are quite a few illegal scooter riders too. but they are all safe from what i see.

"i have observed that electric skateboards and smaller push scooters cost just as much as a full blown electric moped. the full blown electric mopeds have substantially higher range, bigger batteries, similar power, and require more material to build. they still cost comparatively lesser than electric long-boards/mountain-boards or push scooters.&#xb;why is this so? the electric long-boards also have substantially lesser moving parts, smaller range, and fewer required materials. is it the economies of scale that make these products nonviable?"

"[ electric scooters on a crash course to hospital - and courtthere's an electric scooter accident serious enough to warrant hospital every other day on average, according to figures from the act government.but the act government is to toughen the law so police can stop riders they think are over the alcohol limit.since canberra's scheme for shared e-scooters started last year, there have been  hospital admissions for accidents involving ""pedestrian conveyances"". that amounts to  a month to the end of june, the last month when figures were available.the ""pedestrian conveyance"" category does include skate-boards and roller-blades as well as scooters (but not pedal bikes) but the assumption is that most of the hospital admissions came from the newly-introduced scooters.&#xb;there were  accidents serious enough to be reported to the police as ""crashes"".the act government intends to tighten the law. ""e-scooters and bikes should not be seen as an alternative to driving for people who are intoxicated or under the influence of drugs,"" according to transport minister chris steele who introduced the legislation at the assembly.this means that the scooter will not be an acceptable means of transport home from a heavy night out. on an average day, there are nearly  e-scooter rides in the act, according to the territory government.it is not known how many of the casualties at canberra or calvary public hospitals were riders or pedestrians. data for private hospitals were not available.nor is it known how many injured people were wearing a helmet as the regulations require. research in other cities indicates that e-scooter riders are far less likely to wear helmets than cyclists are.""it's clear that the government needs to do more to make sure that both riders and pedestrians can get around our city safely,"" the opposition transport minister mark parton said.the liberals in the act assembly said they had raised concerns about safety ""but the government are still dragging their feet"".""we've already seen a lot of e-scooter injuries in the act, and even deaths in other cities around the world,"" mr parton said.the government said it wasn't clear that all the casualties were victims of e-scooters. it has mounted safety publicly campaigns.privately owned e-scooters have been legal in canberra since december, . ""the commencement of shared schemes in september,  has seen a massive uptake in ridership,"" a spokesperson for the act government said.in the ten months of the shared scooter scheme up to the end of june, ""canberrans have taken a total of ,, e-scooter rides"", the government reported. an average day saw  trips on the shared scooters.a [study in auckland]( compared e-scooter accidents with those involving non-motor bikes. cyclists seemed more likely to obey the law. only ten per cent of scooter riders were wearing protective gear at the time of their accident compared with  per cent of cyclists.of those who were tested for alcohol after being admitted to hospital,  per cent of e-scooter riders had some booze in their system compared with  per cent of cyclists in accidents.the author of the new zealand study, matthew mcguinness, said the findings were a wake-up call that more safety measures were needed."

"they don't want me to own a skateboard because they think im gonna be hospitalized or dead on day/week one. justified that certain accidents can happen when cruising around with it, but its not going to be a exaggerating as what they believed when i can just practice how to skate first and where to cruise safely.first off, i want to own a skateboard because i can balance more on a skateboard than a bike (which my mother owned), i used to borrow skateboards from other skaters before when they're not using it and found out i can easily learn myself to balance onto them. plus im not gonna instantly jump off the rails on day one just because i instantly own one.second, if they're worried about my safety, how about giving me a helmet, then a pair of elbow and knee pads? they can mostly protect me from falls when cruising. yes i know even with the use of protective gears other than the helmet, skateboard misconducts like skating in the middle of the road increases risk of critical injuries can still happen, but again im a beginner learning stuff from both youtube and actual skaters i can meet near my place, and im not gonna instantly just cruise in the middle of the road if i had one. falling off a skateboard (non critically like when failing to balance a skateboard or doing an ollie but i tripped) can be a part of lesson when learning one. [wasn't this thing already been studied and cleared most of the doubts and dangers about skateboarding?]( their misconception that ""fat people can't skate"" is false when my mother can balance herself on a bike, and overweight skaters exists too. anyone can skate regardless if they can handle their own weight and had full commitment to skating, so i don't see the idea of fat people being excluded as a skater.look i know they're just concerned about my safety but its still infruriating that they're using deaths and critical injuries exaggerating their concerns on skating, and the fact that they can have bicycles but not making me own a skateboard (which owning a skateboard with reliable parts costs less than a bike, and can be dangerous as well when being risky about it). one day, i will own a skateboard and defy their misconceptions. even if i graduated on college and get nyself a stable job to earn my own money to buy one, i will still get a skateboard because i will never be too old to learn one in the near future.edit: i finally had one after self earning from my monthly allowance, now learning how to kickturn"
"for the love of god stop walking on the bike paths.today i crashed into a metal railing trying to avoid someone walking. thank fuck no one got seriously hurt but this is what i'm talking about. people get hurt when you walk on bike paths. this is my second crash in  days, yesterday being an unfortunate situation with someone falling off their skateboard that went right under me. i understand that accidents happen but walking on the bike paths is just pure stupidity and negligence. so here's a guide to make it easier to know where to travel:on wheels (not including mobility devices)? use bike paths, shared paths, bike lanes, and roads where permittedon foot/use a mobility device? use walking paths  shared paths, and sidewalksif you refuse to follow those simple guidelines, don't leave your dorm/apartment/home and there won't be so many accidents."
a quick sidenote... just because my scooter is better at stopping doesn't mean i'm more reckless on it. i still don't want to come off or crash into someone. i'm just saying compared to a bike they are safer than most people think and should be legal.
"your line of argument is simplistic, and when it doesn't work, you resort to insults. i'd love to see less cars on the road. give me an approach that considers and addresses the risk to bystanders, and i'm for it."
"i had only bruises though, but they hurted and i was just so freaking hurt and too exhausted to even talk to give them any information besides my first name and a fake address so they said they'll come back around the morning to get the rest and see how things will go and if got better."

a lot of stores here will have handicapped accessible (so-called) toilets... but usually they are put as far away from the door as possible and i cannot walk that far and the scooter's don't fit through the door.

"tl;dr: anyone else get really upset when ill or accidentally injured?according to doctor and lab people i am  a generally healthy person in my early s. i've been sick since monday with rather shitty cold symptoms and upset stomach. i've always had a sensitive stomach but it's been pretty bad for the past few months. first i was freaking out about covid and beating myself up mentally.i have since gotten a negative covid test (got vaccinated a couple months ago) but still berating myself for getting a cold even though i am so paranoid and cautious about getting sick and literally haven't been sick since like this since fall of . it's improved since monday, yet i still have all the symptoms, just to a lesser degree. being sick and operating at less than half my normal functionality is really tough in a few different ways. my body tires quickly, so i can't get active with my kid, fully clean my house, do repairs or even think of doing things that make me feel alive like skate or run around like a feral child in nature. this past week i turned in an assignment late which is gonna take my grade down and i won't get honors when i graduate if i keep this up. and i barely got through my work meeting last week and i have one in  hours that i am not prepared for.not to be dramatic but it feels a bit like facing mortality. i am catastrophizing throughout the day (and using a few dbt skills to calm down). i am terrified of getting sick or hurt again after i recover. being down for more than three or four days makes it impossible for me to perpetuate the mental narrative that i am still young, intelligent and damn near invincible (after reading this i realize that narrative is problem). it makes me think about getting old. constantly comparing myself to my close-in-age sibling who gets sick for like  days max. my partner is like that too. they both heal from wounds like wolverine while i fixate on the bruise i've had for over a week from bumping a table or some shit. this mindset also happened when i got a skateboarding injury last year.i need to work on self-expectations and fear of aging. i can't talk to my fam about it because i'm already too much. anyone else get really upset when ill or injured?"

skate videos were cool. the first video i saw was oceanside which was a contest but skate companies like powell and santa cruz put out full feature videos and a lot of the music was punk rock.
"really makes me wonder why the fuck they even let them do anything before forcing them to make some other bullshit. like they remade crash, then remade thps, and did a fantastic job both times. and their reward is working on call of duty? what an absolute punch in the dick to the team and gamers as a whole."
"well that explains why i saw this amazing invention everywhere in vancouver but rarely on the island. was actually considering buying one of these as it would be excellent for running errands and commuting to work, i guess the concept of a relatively low cost, zero-emission  alternative to cars is so mind-boggling to our provincial government that it thinks the general public isn't ready for it, and thus feels the need to slowly legalize them one city at a time, including nanaimo of all places before us. although considering our biggest controversy since the trucker's protest seems to be pickleball tearing apart our communities, who knows maybe victoria really isn't ready for such a new invention becoming popular /s"

"you already have a good idea of what’s standing in your way from learning, and i think that armed with that knowledge, you can put together a plan to mitigate those risks.  when i learned, i had no one to teach me, just hours upon hours of watching other people trying and failing, and trying again until they got it.  that research paid off in droves because all told, i was able to ride with beginner proficiency in about   hour sessions."
"so although i do think riders who put others at risk using public roads as racetracks or stunt sets are idiots, i don't judge ""squids"", nor the guy with full leathers on a cc scooter, nor the crazy stunt dudes who try that in safe, closed areas."
skaters didn't really listen to rap until public enemy came out. they were signed to def jam which is the same label that also had the beastie boys and slayer. rick rubin introduced punk skaters to metal and bad ass angry hip hop.

"hi, i \[m, ''', lbs\] have a question related to a skateboarding injury from last week. for some context, i've been skateboarding for about  years and have endured the physical consequences of it over the years - i've broken my collar bone and right ankle, have sprained both ankles many, many times, and have had many unfortunately falls leading to lumps, bumps, bruises, etc. luckily, i've never hit my head (knock on wood). these days, i still skate once or twice a week, but i no longer hurl myself down stairs or rails, and just keep things simple at the local skatepark, trying to learn new tricks while getting some much-needed exercise in, as i'm primarily working from a desk during the week. last week, i managed to slam onto my elbow pretty hard. i've done this more times than i can count, and typically i have large lumps on the part of my forearm throughout the summer which i keep an eye on once they develop, letting my shoulders or hands take the fall if the lumps near my elbows are big enough. usually, these lumps coincide with significant bruising and are painful to the touch (but nothing too drastic). from what i can tell via anatomical diagrams from google, these lumps typically develop on my ulna bone close to my actual elbow. however, my slam last week was different. i didn't feel much pain when i hit my elbow, and had simultaneously hit my knee, which was much more painful. but when i got home, i rested my arm on my desk while at my computer, and experienced a sharp and extremely intense pain on the portion of my ulna near my elbow. this caught me completely off guard, and i literally keeled over in pain. oddly, there's no bruising or swelling present, and everything looks normal. but now - even if i apply a small amount of pressure to this area with one finger - the pain is very sharp and intense. there's no pain at all when bending my elbow. i'm a drummer in a band, and this injury has not interrupted my ability to drum at all - only when i apply slight pressure to the area affected. i'm wondering if it's possible that i've either chipped a bone or endured some kind of fracture to my ulna, without having any visible signs of such? i still haven't gotten an x-ray, nor am i sure if it's worth waiting the + hours at the hospital to get one, as it hasn't really affected me other than when i deliberately push on it. any insight is appreciated! thank you."

"i saw that in a grocery store.  two teens were riding their skateboards recklessly giving little shoves to carts, endcaps, & people to boost off of or to aid in their turning into the next aisle.  they were just doing it to be jerks because they were riding by people to engage them or their carts. i even told one kid to “be careful.” after i figured out that the first time he pushed off my cart wasn’t an accident. i decided to keep shopping longer hoping that they would eventually get caught by the cops to or get in a fight with an adult, i just wanted to get me a great justice boner.  i saw the store manager just walking not giving a f even though he acknowledged me before i could say something.  he knew,  minutes later i hear a loud crash, an old lady screaming and a few seconds later a teen crying like a little baby.  turns out that that teen was trying to slamon in the wide aisle between the displays in the dairy aisle.  for those of you who don’t know there are sometimes drains in the event that liquids are spilled.  my guess was that he was bobbing and weaving and his skateboard wheel grazed this as he was turning back left to set up his next turn.  his skateboard stayed in place and his face and teeth turned into the tip of a  🖍 . his friend left the store and everybody gathered around just looking.  no customer called , (i think we were all fed up with him and wanted him to learn his lesson. he wasn’t going to die, but him almost hitting little kids and the elderly earlier lowered his social score.) the manager had to call once he assessed the situation.  he took a few minutes to get there too.  he didn’t give an f about those kids.  the kid lost most of his front teeth and broke the right side of his face leaving a  foot streak of blood in the aisle.  the fire department came and i left to go checkout my groceries.  this kid is probably around  now, hopefully he learned his lesson."

"smartwheels use sonar, laser range finding and millimeter wave radar to identify mufflers and other debris. each one consists of a hub with many tiny spokes. each spoke telescopes into five sections. on the end is a squat foot, rubber tread on the bottom, swiveling on a ball joint. as the wheel rolls, the feet plant themselves one at a time, almost glomming into one continuous tire. if you surf over a bump, the spokes contract to roll over it. if you surf over a pothole, the rubber prongs probe its asphalt depths. either way, the shock is thereby absorbed, no thuds, smacks, vibrations, or clunks will make their way into the plank or the converse hightops with which you tread it. the ad was right - you cannot be a professional road surfer without smartwheels."

starting to understand why motorcyclists call car/truck drivers cagers. i try to stick to back roads to stay away from those death machines but even then i've had too many close calls. even when i'm going  mph i'll have dumbasses who tailgate me when the speed limit is -. us road infrastructure is absolute dogshit for cyclists and pev riders. at least i'm able to keep up with traffic somewhat. i couldn't imagine using a bicycle on the road with some of these people
possibly anything to do with the demographic. if you make it illegal for the people that would just commute with it then you are restricting fully owned scooters to people willing to break the law. i'd imagine that a group of society is also more hazardous.
"i’m about  weeks into a full acl reconstruction, and repair to a meniscus tear and meniscus root tear. safe to say recovery has been a bit of a struggle, because of the root tear i wasn’t allowed to weight-bare until about two weeks ago. i am progressing at a very comfortable level, putting weight on my leg is easy, i’m about to be walking on my own without crutches, flexion and extension is on the money, and my quad strength is increasing at a steady level. my doctor says he is very happy with the surgery, saying that it couldn’t have been better. hearing all of this, i’m not really nervous for a re-tear or any complications. i do want to hear some stories of people who skate. it’s the one sport i want to get back into, as i have been doing it for years. i know it’s a fairly taxing sport for the knees, and there are plenty of ways to screw up after recovery. i want to hear how skating after full recovery is, and most importantly, what i should do in order to keep skating for a long time.thank you all!"

"the reactions in my circle of friends varied widely. the germans mostly shrugged and went on with their day - they knew that their kids would know what to do if approached by a stranger, and that the actual danger to them was negligible. the american parents on the other hand went into a mad frenzy, strategising about whom they could carpool with, relating stories they had heard about from other places, comparing gps tracking devices for their children, and fretting about whether it was even safe to let their children walk to their friends' house down the street."

"children are also expected to know how to handle being bored, whereas in the us it seems the pressure is enormous for parents to ""provide stimulating content"" for their children. of course german children who are bored will whine just as loudly as american children about wanting to use the tablet - but if the parents say ""no"" long enough, then the child learns to find something interesting on their own without being reliant on outside help (e.g. with their peers)."
"first of all, when i see an ebike driver, i generally don't see much in the way of protective equipment. even on smaller motorcycles and scooters it is somewhat idiotic to wear basically just jeans and a helmet, as it isn't that uncommon to get in an accident in which the difference is between good equipment and a pin in their hip for the rest of their life. i also maybe see a basic front fork suspension and occasionally some suspension on the rear of ebikes, but those are generally the ones that a lot were spent on (in my mind, basic motorcycle money). this level of suspension isn't a big deal on a bike that is maybe going at mph top speed, but if you start going over that the risk of injury goes up exponentially, just by something like hitting a rock in the road. you could beef up the suspension, but that would cause the bike to weight more and in turn require more work on the frame, and when you get that far you are basically talking about a scooter or motorcycle. the easiest solution is to better define the lines between an ebike and an electric motorcycle, which are currently not the most clear."

stupid road design.  footpaths/sidewalks abutting roadways is asking for precisely this sort of incident.
"i'm , female, and have crps in my right hand as a result of failed surgeries on my right clavicle. chronic pain also contributed to severe depression, and classic anti-depressants never worked for me. i had never tried ketamine before, but love acid very much. i've had this pain for about  years, and have tried medication (lyrica/opiates), physical therapy, acupuncture, omt, and eventually traveled about  hours to get stellate ganglion blocks from a pain management specialist; those only lasted - days and had bad side effects for me. pain specialist suggested the ketamine infusion, since i am young and otherwise pretty healthy, and the permanent stellate block would give me a lazy eye for a long time. i had to come in for a psych eval first. they asked about how the pain affects my life, what i've done to try to help myself, history of substance abuse (i was not completely honest here, but i had been sober for about a year), history of trauma/anxiety, history of suicidal thoughts (depression, but no thoughts of suicide). i'll admit that i downplayed my history of anxiety/trauma. i was cleared for the infusion.i was a little nervous, because i didn't get any instructions from my doctor, like should i fast, stop/continue meds, even after several calls to the hospital, so i did my own research and stopped opiates (low dose, no withdrawal) and fasted, which was ok because i was admitted to the hospital around am. i drank black coffee, but did not eat. they were confused when i got there, told me people don't usually ""just walk in to the icu"", so after waiting around while they figured it out, i was admitted and sent up to the icu. the nurses were friendly but curious, most had never seen a ketamine infusion before and were wondering why i was up there, because i could walk, talk, joke around with them, etc. i had to change in to a hospital gown, but was allowed to keep my leggings on. i got a chest x-ray and was told i have beautiful lungs, so that's rad. i also got an ekg. i was probably getting tests done for about  hours before they began the infusion. they started by giving me iv fluids and i had  electrodes taped to me to monitor vital signs. my blood pressure was monitored every  minutes. because of the pain on the right side, the blood pressure cuff and  ivs were all on the left. i was given versed, a pretty strong benzo, then they began the ketamine infusion. i was trying to remain calm and upbeat, and make jokes//be friendly with the staff. time was moving so slow it was almost frustrating; the clock on the wall said  minutes had passed and it felt like hours. i wouldn't say it was pleasant, or unpleasant, at first. my right hand was sweating and felt warm - it usually does not sweat much and is always freezing cold, so i was happy about that. my father came with me, and i said he could go, as i felt like i wanted to be in my head and couldn't communicate very well. i  felt that could think clearly, but had trouble speaking, but that wasn't scary. i felt like listening to music and spacing out. i saw beautiful geometric shapes and textures/colors, and had some good music, and could answer questions about where/who i was, but remember only being able to talk like a robot. i was allowed to get up one time to use the bathroom, but after that, they would not let me walk and i didn't like that. they were right, i could not walk. i was tripping pretty hard and didn't like peeing in the bedpan, but they were cool about it and made me feel comfortable. once, they left the room so i could pee alone, and i bugged out a little because i really didn't like balancing on the full bedpan by myself so i yelled ""heeeelp with the ketamiiine and the peeeee!"" various doctors came in to talk to me, and now i don't know if they were really there. i thought i heard them telling my history, ""/f, skateboard crash...surgeries..."" but was convinced they couldn't be taking about me, that it was so weird there was someone else there the same day with my same story! a bunch of med students came in to meet me, but i don't know if they were really there. i talked to my doctor, but i just complimented his beard and complained that ""my fingernails were growing"", and was convinced he was going to email me about that. i'm pretty sure that's the only time i saw him. the first  hours were pleasant; vivid, beautiful dreams, no anxiety, definitely weird but not scary. i had headphones and music, but i had to close one eye and hold my phone far away and still couldn't see, so i fucked up my playlist and couldn't articulate to anyone what i needed, just help with youtube music. i couldn't remember shit. i was somehow ordering food, but could not eat, it seemed way too weird, and didn't remember ordering it. i'd ask for things, they'd come back with them, and i'd politely say no thanks. i'm not sure how much of the memory loss was the k, or the versed. they'd give me versed about every  hours, or when i couldn't answer their questions. i remember trying to turn it down so i could feel the ketamine. i had dreams of beautiful vivid tiny birds, colors/geometric shapes, and a beautiful woman who would say little words that would show up on tiny scrolls. the visuals are hard to describe, but they were intense and gorgeous. i wasn't asleep, or awake either. the first night, i began feeling what i can only describe as a feeling that i was plugged in to everyone else in the world, and could float around and mentally communicate with everyone. i felt a sense of constant anticipation that almost equated to frustration, but not quite. everything was a new visual, but felt familiar, constant sense of deja vu. i'd float around the world, and end up back in my hospital room, but it looked completely different each time. it was a feeling of perpetual movement/floating that was really fun and nice. the next day didn't go very well. the timeline of all this is very fuzzy to me. i had left my son's father about a year before, and had a new boyfriend. i felt the pain and deep shame that i had caused him and his family very intensely and could not stop crying. i couldn't fuckin figure out youtube, but somehow managed to facetime my ex, sobbing and apologizing, and asked him to marry me. then i felt horribly guilty about doing that. then i felt that the universe had betrayed me because i had broken my pinky on my bad hand a couple months before; that sounds really silly now, but i know i was pretty upset about that. i scared the crap out of my father, and he still won't really talk about what happened. i don't remember anyone trying to talk me down, they just medicated me with more versed hourly. i could be wrong. i couldn't even talk to my boyfriend, i felt that i didn't know him or trust him. the guilt and shame were persistent feelings that i couldn't shake. i don't remember much of the second night, and was still tripping very hard the next morning. after they stopped the infusion, i didn't think i was still hallucinating, but continued to scare my father by hearing conversations that weren't happening. i left accusing the nurses of talking about me and demanded a copy of their report, and was convinced they were lying to me. on the drive home, i saw a man in the road and yelled at my dad, thinking he was going to hit him; he wasn't real. i still couldn't stop crying. my dad made me go to the er after we got home because my anxiety was so bad. they gave me valium, but after it would wear off i'd be back to crying. then, my boyfriend and i had what wasn't a fight, but a talk, and long story short, he shot himself in the face. he survived. i was still out of my mind with anxiety and unsure of reality, so this was an already terrible situation made worse to me. if i hadn't had the infusion, that conversation wouldn't have happened, but i'm working on not blaming myself. that's not easy. my hand is cured for now; pain of like / from daily /; and even through crazy grief, guilt, and confusion, i felt that my terrible depression was better. this was all about  months ago; my hand is still ok, but i'm pretty depressed again; a lot of that is circumstance. it's taken me til now to even be able to write about this. they will not give me another infusion, but even though this wasn't a good experience, i would get another one for the pain relief and be better prepared. feel free to ask me any questions!"

"when covid hit, and the number of food delivery riders surged due to increased demand and also an increase in the retrenched or furloughed taking up delivery jobs. these riders work with tight schedules and many of them opt to ride bicycles as they can be parked closer to the pick up and drop off points as well as being cheaper. this of course boosted bike usage and so cyclists started using the road in some legs of their journey to cut their traveling time or simply because there weren't adequate cycling paths. there are definitely bad actors who flaunt road safety rules and ride even brasher than drivers but for the most part, i think cyclists are aware of the risk they take on the roads."
so i’m thinking about either getting an electric skateboard or one wheel for getting around campus. are they allowed? i saw something online saying that they don’t allow electric scooters to be charged inside of university buildings.

"it was already kind of hurt from an old skateboarding injury. i was riding my bike just now up a hill, i put my leg out to catch myself and i heard a pop and then i couldnt really put weight on that leg. i still cant.i live in california, i'm unemployed, , a male, i live at home and pay rent to my parents. im broke right now, about to get an unemployment insurance extension. i really don't know what to do, my parents can't afford to help me.reddit, i'm not asking for money. i really need advice on what to do. i still have bills from when i broke my hand. i have a history of being a hard worker, managed a pizza place when i was -, then sold cell phones and was our # customer service rep in our office. while skateboarding during this time, i hurt my knee pretty bad. it slowly healed but i never skateboarded again :[ . then something bad happened with sprint and our company, owner and all got the boot. my father and my uncle leased a small diner on a golf course, my dad was getting really tired from working  hour days every day of the week, so i started working for him half of the week. we worked hard and it felt great. the money simply was not coming in there though. they had to pull out. my dad now manages a local deli chain location. i have been unemployed since then and looking at opportunities to work from home such as chacha, which i think ill be doing now, as my knee is jacked. reddit, i would be willing and able to do any data entry or anything for somebodies  business. any work at all. im also just looking for help on what to do. ive already had my bouts of frustration over my countries lack of healthcare, but that wont help me. please reddit, i feel like my life just changed forever, i have to start saving money for knee surgery now. i can't focus on the girl i love as much. fuck, reddit please give me ideas. im seriously considering moving to norway, i will work my ass off for them. **tl;dr: i really hurt my knee, no insurance, no job. will do anything for a job"
"hi guys,i am looking for a (security camera?) video in which someone with a mobility scooter gets stuck on a small railway crossing (for a ridable minature train). when the mini train comes from the right side it goes very slow and bumps the scooter on it's side. i think it happened in a theme park or something. it's a funny video, not nsfw. that's all i remember.first time posting so i hope i complied."
gave myself a smiley of all smilies during self harm. heated the lighter up for couple minutes and held it down as hard as i could on my arm until it stopped hurting. it melted the skin. got mega infected and now a big pink ‘a’ on my forearm for everyone to ask about it. i’m not depressed now to do shit like that again.

"if you have an electric skateboard and the battery dies, can you still ride it like a normal skateboard back to your house to fix it or can the wheel only rotate if the battery works?"
hello people hoping you all are warm in this weather. i am looking to buy a electric scooter under  lac and  as cheap and safe it can get. (the lower the price the better) uses- a daily commute of  kms on average and single stretch of  kms or so. can you humans with knowledge or experience with this help this noob out. thank you!
"i've had several accidents where a cyclist (and even one scooter operator) had ran a red light, didn't stop for a stop sign, but because the officer at the scene did not charge them, the driver is held at fault."
"there was mounting frustration with myself in my failure to practice a stoic approach through what i’ve learned about it up to this point, when i escalated a fight that my dad started. i gave into my anger and broke a fake plastic succulent by yanking on the tablecloth during my attempt to de-escalate the conflict by trying to have civil conversation at the dining table. i got up from my seat and my father grabbed me. i have three freshly fractured ribs from a skateboarding injury, and the fact he did that hurts the sense of security and stability i have here more than my ribs. it brought me back to months ago when my uncle attacked me for putting my foot down and firmly telling him it’s not okay to be verbally abusive to me. it took me months to begin to feel safe again from that incident, and i feel i’m back again at the beginning. both my father and my uncle are older men in their s, and i’m  years old. i’m not trying to use my age as an excuse for the faults in my behavior. neither do i think they should be excused for the negligence in theirs. yet i forgive both of them, and still then i let anger surrounding these things get to me. after that happened i collapsed sobbing and was rocking myself back and forth. i was like that for  minutes. after the pain was out i told my dad i forgive him and love him because he apologized unlike his brother. he briefly cried and expressed that he’s deeply concerned about me. i’ve seen my dad break down twice in my life, once during / and tonight. i went on a walk and started to become angry again when i realized the phone conversation i was having with my mom about the incident was doing me more harm than good. i am not proud of this: i snapped, and screamed and yelled at the universe while walking through my suburb. it was so loud the neighbor even came out to see what was going on. i came home and yelled and screamed at my dad while still on the phone with my mom. in the bouts of lashing out i was saying “i love you and i forgive you” in a panicked attempt to diminish the hurt i was causing. i know that’s not love. i was screaming and yelling at him filled with hate. it is not my place to lash out at the world because i’m in pain.i communicated everything that happened to my therapist, and i’m hoping i can get the help i need to ease the difficulty in understanding and managing these strong emotions. i don’t own a copy of how to be free let alone meditations because i can’t afford one at the moment, and i want to read the former before i start meditations. i know stoicism is not a cure-all for unhealthy relationships and mental healthy issues. that being said it does help me along the way and i’m trying to understand it better. i’m doing everything i can with what i know now to be a better person. i’m frustrated with myself that i let this happen. i don’t want to be this way. i’m trying to change and i won’t let this stop me. i’m humbly asking the community here for some direction on how to go about things differently moving forward."
"anyone remember the episode where sean makes the proclamation, i think due to his extensive knowledge of skateboard injuries, that he's basically a doctor? he immediately walks it back in the face of understandable incredulity from david."
"i don't believe in financing things via a credit card, but a helmet (preferably a full-faced bike bmx or motorcycle helmet) is one thing i would finance versus going without."
"i am male, , and am on no medications. i have a history of broken bones if that matters.   yesterday i was riding down a very steep hill and at the end of the hill the road ended and it was just dirt. i rode down the hill fine but at the end i got thrown off my skateboard and hit the ground hard. once i hit the ground i was told i rolled about - times and then finally stopped. (i was probably thrown about ft). i had a bad scrape on my left side / waist. but that was it at the moment. i didn't have any other pain. all day today my entire torso has been sore, but my middle stomach area is the worst. sitting down, getting up, laughing, coughing, among other things all cause pain. ( /)"
fart! toot! that is all.
"anyone else notice the number of abandoned electric scooters around the area?   while nice in concept, they're quickly becoming e-waste.  i can only imagine the number of these finding their way into the inner harbor or various parts of onondaga creek."
"hi, i made a video regarding the issue. need your advice if i can manually fix it or should i just buy new? thank you for the help."
"not just turning, but smart enough to turn in a direction that will slow him down."
"they sell small cars here also but i need to put my walker in the back seat and when i owned a car (as opposed to my suv) the ""lip"" between the door and the driver seat floor was too high and painful to put my foot over,,, and painful to get up and down from the lower seat.  with what i have now (a honda cr-v)  i can just scoot my butt into the seat. and i have to use adaptive hand controls, which may not be available on a smaller vehicle. in addition... where i was living when i first changed cars (in rural virginia) we had so many deer that driving a mini car would be very dangerous and a crash with a deer likely life threatening)."
"my mum's been in thailand since end of february with a group of her friends. biggest trip she's ever been on and they all sound like they're having blast.but i get a call from my mum's bff yesterday telling me mum had scooter accident and was in the icu. she needed surgery in her right arm and her right leg is in cast. she has a breathing tube but that should come out today or tomorrow.mum texted me last night with hospital info and to say she was ok but super bummed. bff said she's talking with insurance to get mum airlifted back to canada for the rest of her hospital stay if possible.it sounds like mum is going to fine, but she's still pretty badly hurt on the other side of the world and there's nothing i can do. i can't be there with her. i feel like a damn zombie today, trying to be present for my  year old but just barely functioning.my mum is basically the coolest person i know and i could have lost her."
out of date vehicle standards. technology exists which can alert drivers of high vehicles when an unexpected object enters the truck drivers blind spots; yet such technology isn't compulsory in most developed countries. why the fuck not?

"old lady here who between - backpacked around the world once and through india - jeez, twice, i forgot the other one! - the first two times with an ultralight daypack, the third time with a carryon suitcase that converts to a backpack because i was going to a wedding in calcutta and then to frigid high mountains in georgia in april so i had to pack for  climates (i just gave away my wedding stuff in calcutta to lighten the load)."
"also a good example of controlled fall vs uncontrolled fall. i used to skate, i know exactly how to fall off a skateboard to minimise injury. i had no idea what to do when i fell off a mountain bike."
"so after some googling, i realize electric scooters' crashes mostly result in faceplants and i do wish to keep my face unscathed. i'm planning to order a full face helmet but the only thing that bothers me is how to carry the helmet once i get to my destination. do ppl just use helmet slings or bags or do they prefer to get those backpacks with helmet straps?"

one could make an argument that the overwhelming majority of consumer goods available for sale carry an inherent risk of danger if used incorrectly.
"ice motorcycles aren't the solution, due to pollution concerns. they really just aren't. the closer you get to  cc, the worse your efficiency gets as well - by the time you're to  cc, you're worse off than the most efficient ice cars, because of the incredibly poor aerodynamic performance of most motorcycles, and the engine design/tuning of motorcycles tending to be for low cost and usually high performance for their displacement, at the expense of efficiency and emissions."
"so yeah, that was kind of a crazy story."
prosecutor gareth james qc said it was not necessary to disclose the full nature of jack’s horrific injuries to the public in court to avoid “unnecessary distress to those already suffering”.

"“in order to be able to compete, we need to have order,” xavi said at his first press conference. “it is not about being hard, but about order and rules, and the rules must be followed. when i have had rules in the dressing room, things have gone well. when the rules were not followed, things didn’t go so well.”"
onewheel spills are generally the most violent since they result in you being thrown towards the ground like a falling domino. look at all the broken collarbones and scraped palms. what doesn't help is people getting big heads in the first  miles or less and nosediving. conclusion: the most violent and probably most common due to the nature of a self-balancing vehicle of this form factor.
"“well fuck, what the hell do we do now then?”"
"anyway, i guess the point is that medical costs for crashes like these are not covered by tac, so if you decide to access services as a private patient you have to pay whatever isn’t covered by your private health insurance. or you could just access free public services."
what's this tsla too expensive meme? at  pe ~  it's the bargain on the century.  i really struggle to understand why anyone would think it's expensive.
"yet, if your attitude is the attitude of those who want to play with our toys and fuck with our hobby, then i suppose maybe we'll end up deserving it as a whole."
redditors. doing nothing at all ever because it may result in some crazy .% chance edge case that could possibly be dangerous.
legacy auto ice trucks are really an example of a skateboard chassis where the body is sitting on top of a ladder frame unit containing all drivetrain components. the body of trucks can actually be totally lifted off. cab removal example. this would be impossible with the cybertruck.
"yes, in crowded city center i rarely go above km/h even when my scooter can go faster, but not everyone rides or lives in densely populated cities, so on long bike paths through the outskirts of the city or the surrounding countryside the km/h speed limit makes zero sense."

"“absent a commitment to expeditiously make the dramatic systemic reforms identified by the monitor and to bring in corrections experts from outside the department to revamp the agency’s operations and staffing practices, we will be left with no other option but to seek more aggressive relief, which could involve seeking the appointment of a receiver with independent authority to implement sweeping reforms,” the letter said."
"it's also important to talk about your feelings and share what you're going through, if you're lucky enough you'll have your family and friends to talk to, if not this sub is just fine, it helped me tremendously throughout the years. in my darkest time i would lean back on this community and always get help. i met one of my best friends in here, she's on the other side of the planet but it means the world to me sharing what i'm going through with someone who knows precisely what if feels like"
"one of the things i remember most was this dude we hired. had a great interview seemed like a really positive guy, level headed."
"been there, done that. with good quality armour and assuming you're not riding like an absolute moron, the overwhelming majority of accidents are just a financial pain in the ass with a bit of bruising."
"i'm very sorry you have to deal with reckless people, but think how they would do in a car. i have seen so many people drink, text, and drive. if anything, it's scarier to think of someone that is that irresponsible in a car than a scooter. and i'm sure we have all seen our fair share of car crashes to know the consequences of their actions..."
something similar to this i probably saw on reddit was someone who had just done and interview about their electric scooter and i think was using a crossing and a car went directly into them.
"radiks called, and they want their skateboard back."

"i am feeling alright and have crashed a lot, because i signed up for that possibility as a bike commuter. but this was bad luck, and we made good of a bad situation. i just hate these stupid electric vehicles cause most people use them stupidly."
he then returned to the scene and has been cooperating with fhp investigators. he was not injured in the crash.
"i'm in bristol and they have royally gone to the ends of the earth to mess it up so bad!! i used to like driving but now it just feels like a headache. i've never suffered from anxiety but being on the roads here now gives me massive anxiety. every time i'm driving or in a car i have to dodge people in other cars just pulling out on you or drifting into your lane or slamming on their brakes half way round a roundabout. every single time i always nearly have a crash through no fault of my own. you ever been on the dodgems or bumper cars? it's exactly like that!! anyways i know i'll get shit for this but i've got an electric scooter, yea i'm  😂😂, but my scooter does mph with full suspension and hydraulic disc brakes and lights and i'll tell you, it's a dream to drive, it's like the stress of driving is gone and i feel free!! i've gone past worrying about the feds, i don't just don't care, i won't stop for them and they definitely won't catch me on it once i do a ° turn and zoom off 😂. but yea i can get anywhere in bristol twice as fast and less stress than a car. when you factor in the cost of a car purchase, tax, insurance, mot, fuel etc, the cost is a tiny fraction of what a car would take. bristol has got to be  of the worst congested places in the country though for sure."
i've watched what videos i could on youtube about electric scooter crashes and there isn't much time to react.
in any other situation if i was struck with a skateboard and then shot my aggressor i’d be under the prison.
"i want to buy one, it seems like a good idea for someone in my position. i don’t drive for other reasons but i picked up a second job last year because i really needed the extra cash, but the job is not really walkable so it was hard getting back and fourth. i’m thinking of going there again this year (it’s only seasonal) and i thought to myself i could use an electric scooter!when i brought this up to others i got laughed at :( i thought it was a good idea and still do but it’s left me feeling weirdly embarrassed. i have bad anxiety and i don’t like to attract any attention as it is. have you dealt with negative attention when riding? should i go ahead and get one?update > i didn’t expect to get so many replies! i’m going through them throughout the day. guys i am so sorry i didn’t realise where i live it’s not even legal to ride them unless it’s in private land apparently. i’ve been on a downer since i found out lol. so sorry. always a problem when i find a solution! thank you so much for the replies though, if it ever changes i will % buy one. i was thinking even buying one for fun because some of the replies got me hyped to ride one!"
falling asleep on the couch.
"i’m almost wondering if i’ve sold myself short by calling my jnmil “run of the mill boundary stomper”, based on the kind comments on my first post and the more i think about some of the stories i have to tell. brief review of what i’ve told so far: we’re vvvvlc with run of the mill – i’d say nc because we pretty much never open conversations with her, but every so often they come back knocking on our door. run of the mill always “denies, defends or deflects” when we’ve tried over the many years to address her behaviors and our concerns with her. she thinks i’m unloving because of the history of (treated and untreated) alcoholism in my family, very conveniently ignoring the history of (treated and untreated) alcoholism and mental illness in dh’s.so i’m going to start the first of three stories that are classic “why we didn’t let them babysit the kids or see the kids without us.” this is one of their very big talking points now that the kids are adults. it sounds like they’ve been just sort of biding their time with this expectation that once our kids became adults, we couldn’t restrict their access anymore. in fact, for my son’s most recent birthday, they sent him a card that said, paraphrasing “now that you’re an adult, we can talk to you about how your parents kept you from us all these years….” you will come to see that what we did was set totally reasonable boundaries that she didn’t like so she cut her nose to spite her face. it was her way or nothing. give an inch, she’ll take a mile…i’m saving the most dramatic for last so they won’t be in chronological order. also, this one is good because it gives me an opportunity to introduce another piece of information to the puzzle:everyone in our family is highly educated. we have several people with doctorates, both medical and otherwise. in every household of our immediate families, there is at least one person with a graduate level degree in child development and/or medicine. everyone is an expert, including run of the mill. oh yes, my jnmil was at one point in her career paid to be a parenting expert who did workshops/talks about how to be a parent. i’ll just let that sit there for a minute for you. yes, my jnmil was considered a “parenting expert” in her community. it wasn’t a big community - a very, very niche market. you haven’t heard of her, but it would break her heart that you haven’t. she once found someone selling a used copy of her autographed book online and she was unbelievably indignant that someone would sell such a treasure. with that said, i had a few fm’s of my own – one or two people who stayed in contact with run of the mill over the years. one of them, a member of the aforementioned community, conceded that “she doesn’t practice what she preaches.”here’s the other tidbit: dh and his sibs, as well as my children and most of their cousins, were not and are not allowed to own skateboards. this is because of how many skateboard injuries the medical professionals in our family have seen first hand. i was born at a time when no one used carseats – but my parents used carseats until i was in kindergarten. my mom was mocked by the pta moms for being overprotective. so keeping our nuggets safe is a long standing tradition in our families. by the time my children were born, carseats and safety equipment like bicycle helmets were mandated by law. one day, dh came home from work ranting because he’d seen a child in our neighborhood flying downhill along side a major street on a scooter without a helmet. dh told me: “if that was my child, i would’ve grabbed my blow torch and said, ‘here kid, put on these goggles and watch me cut up your scooter.’” oh, and one more: we have a well known family in our community whose child was killed while riding a bicycle without his helmet. they’re a wonderful family who turned their heartbreak into a foundation that donates helmets and carseats to children and families in our community.at the point of this story i had a couple of kids, one baby and one preschooler. i was actually not home for this one, it was just dh and his parents. dh came inside to put the baby down for a nap, and then took the opportunity to sit down in the bathroom for a bit… while he was there, he heard ds out in the distance making noise but didn’t think much of it. when he finished and came out, ds and his grandparents were gone. gone.this was a time when cell phones were less common, and run of the mill takes pride in being slow to adapt to technology. dh’s spine was not quite shinnied up at this point. he opted to stay put with the sleeping baby and wait for them to return.once they did, it turns out that they took our son to the park, on his bike, without his helmet, and without dh’s permission. he was riding the bike through our neighborhood, to the park, during daytime traffic and they were following him - with no helmet on. the child of the guy who wasn’t allowed to own a skateboard. and they were gone without any way for us to contact them, without our permission or knowledge.of course, they didn’t think it was a problem at all. we should’ve just trusted that they would not let anything happen to our child. “we were right there!” ok so you could’ve just witnessed the car hit our child while he wasn’t wearing a helmet?their excuse was that they told our preschooler to tell dh. ds had come inside our house, shouted “dad! we’re going to da park!” and ran outside back to his grandparents. dh never heard, never consented. but run of the mill got the answer she wanted “did you tell daddy?” ds: yep!we should just trust them, they said. “we would never do anything to hurt your child physically, emotionally or spiritually,” they said. (spoiler alert for those of you creating bingo cards: go ahead and make  boxes for those three categories because they’re going to all get marked off.)"
"i mean, just fucking look at it ""killing  unarmed men and injuring another."" it was proven one of them was armed with a gun and another with a skateboard. it's misinformation, and it's obvious"
"then  kids got killed in an accident involving a stint and a train. the stint was a electric transport vehicle used to transport kids between school and out of school care. this of course caused a huge outcry and an investigation. it was found that the oversight by the rdw was not strict enough. this led the rdw going from one extreme, almost everything goes, to the other extreme, we really need to know about all the safety implications before we give the ok. so the bar to get a e-scooter legal in the netherlands is very high and most manufacturers don't care and the importers don't have the budget to go through the process."
oh and doing stupid decisions like flying to another country with very little money
"i knew a guy who was hungry after a party in college but knew he was too drunk to drive. so he rode his electric scooter down to a drive through. the folks at the drive through called the cops because he obviously drunk. when the cops came to talk to him he said ""i know i'm drunk and that's why i rode this down here instead of driving because this way if i crash i'm only hurting myself.""  the cop ended up putting his scooter in the trunk and gave him a ride home, and didn't even give him a ticket."
"i can ride a scooter, and i'm pretty handy with tools. when i say cheaply, i mean very cheaply, as in this is gonna be something i aspire to buy whenever i figure out a way i can make any money at all. i don't have any public transportation options where i live in the us, and i just don't know where to start. i know this may not be where i should ask this but i'm pretty clueless as to the market and don't know if i should get a motorized bike or something besides a scooter. as of right now i don't have the means of charging anything electric, i don't think that's gonna change anytime soon but it could by the time i can afford one any advice at all will be extremely appreciated"
here's the list of things that cops would not be able to engage pedestrians and bicycles about anymore:
"source: none, because its fake, since we all know it was donald trump who killed the natives."
stock car boy = scb
"when i worked at target, everyone knew about this old man who would ride around in one of those electric wheelchairs. he would constantly knock down the starbucks shelves on ""accident"" and speed away on his scooter."

"e-scooter injuries keep piling up e-scooters can cause way more than a few scrapes and bruises. a uc los angeles study from last month looked at two southern california hospitals and the number of electric scooter injuries reported there for about a year. it totaled  people sent to the er and  with head injuries. now consumer reports has … continue reading e-scooter injuries keep piling up → february ,  at :pm"

"a couple days ago i was riding an electric scooter and feel off it. i ended up hitting a close by car and scratching it slightly. the man got out and only took my phone number. i’ve gotten a couple calls from them, i haven’t responded, and idk what to do because this doesn’t fall under my insurance and i’d have to pay out of pocket. i want to avoid this so what should i do?"
"this is not necessarily instant karma, but it happened soon after and was is a pretty big incident of it."
"i used to ride an electric skateboard for transportation (sometimes in combination with a bus, even then the bus driver might not want me on with the skateboard, claiming it might explode, i laughed and told him 'not with how much i paid for it') and even though i was to the side where bicyclists and such should have a safe space, they never gave me that proper space, speeding by way too close. some would yell as they passed by to 'get off the road!'

"hi! i've had a segway ninebot f electric scooter for about three months now and absolutely love it. however, i noticed that the brakes are getting less and less sensitive--now, i have to pull them all the way down. still, when i'm go downhill, sometimes i feel like i'm barely slowing down! is there a way i can tighten the brakes, or do i have to replace them? and if i have to replace them, could someone point me to somewhere i could order them and what i need to get exactly? sorry for all the questions and thanks for your help! i'm not very handy and i'd appreciate any advice. :)"
i come from a former soviet state:
"**tldr:** more people get hurt riding scooters on roads compared to sidewalks. people feel safer riding on sidewalks, and drivers driving km/h don't want scooters going km/h in their lane. e-scooters are very successful in cities where they can be ride on sidewalks. just don't be a dick while riding e-scooters people.i cannot be the only one in this city who thinks it's absolutely absurd that good ol' donny iveson is saying e-scooters are not going well and don't belong on sidewalks. this kind of illogical thinking bothers me, they're proving to be a great mode of alternative transportation, so i've went out and did some research to prove that he is wrong.\- on average in america, there are around .- injuries per , e-scooter rides. more people get injured riding e-scooters on the road compared to sidewalks (% injuries were on roads / % injuries on sidewalks). source: [ a cdc study (america) also confirmed that majority of injuries happen on the street, although most injuries don't involve cars (only %), rather from falling/hitting potholes/riding under the influence."" there has been no noticeable indication of pedestrian injuries due to e-scooter riders. source: [ calgary, edmonton's best comparable, has had  trips since implementation which is an indication of tremendous success. source: [ calgary doesn't allow e-scooters on their roads, completely opposite stance from edmonton. ""*a statement from calgary's department of transportation noted that e-scooters — which operate at speeds of up to  km/h — are not fast enough for most roads but are ideal for cycle tracks and paths. the city asks scooter riders to limit their speeds on sidewalks.*"" why should edmonton be any different when calgary clearly says they aren't ideal for roads? source: [ i'm riding a tiny two-wheeled platform, that can only go around km/h, why the hell would i want to ride it on a road with vehicles travelling - km/h? if i'm a driver, i certainly don't want to have to navigate around slow moving scooters on a busy road.and don't mention the damn bike lanes, it's not justifiable to the average person to go out of their way to use bike lanes (when they're paying by the minute to ride the scooter) when using the sidewalk is usually a shorter (and therefore cheaper) route. if bike lanes were on every road, then i would understand, but they aren't, and sidewalks are.so yeah, those are my thoughts. do the scooters cause some hassle at times? i'm sure they do. can some people be dicks while riding them? absolutely. but i would think that a mayor that is pushing alternative transportation would be happy with the growing utilization rate, and see the benefits outweigh the drawbacks."
took my first spill from my speed de-limited kaabo mantis a few days ago.  a pedestrian stepped in front of me on a paved mixed bike/jogging track and i had to stack to avoid cleaning her up. fell heavily on my butt/left flank. broke no bones and lost no skin but knocked the wind out of myself and got a ripper bruise! will definitely be more wary of peds in future. stay safe!
"i need help. i have no one to talk to about this.i met a charming man. incredibly charming. he has blown away everyone in my family, sending gifts, etc. everyone loves him. so did i, at first. he proposed exactly a year later after dating and he moved in after  months. at first he was only verbally abusive, followed by massive charm. occasionally he would hold is fist up in anger and break things. the physical abuse started when he moved in. example: he knew i was going out with one of my single friends. he grabbed my by the throat and brought me to the ground, pinned me down, emptied a bottle of water all over my freshly curled hair and makeup and smeared lipstick all over my face. he has told me to get out of his car several times in the middle of town, ripped out my hair, punched me. this last time was a dozy. this tuesday before thanksgiving, we were supposed to meet my family in cabo and my wedding planner (this whole trip was paid for already by my family). we had a massive fight monday night (the night before we left) and he grabs me by the hair and slams my face into a wall and tv. my expensive nose job that i worked so hard to give myself, was instantly broken, blood everywhere. he left me saying he hated me saying it was my fault it got this bad. this is where it gets embarrassing....i called him begging him not to give up on us, i couldn’t live without him. after all, we were planning to fly to cabo in  hours to meet my entire family and wedding planner. how could i be faced with this embarrassment? he agreed to come home after i begged for long enough. the whole trip i had black eyes and wore tape on my nose. i said i had an electric scooter accident. they are all the rage in la. now is the week back in la, it is back to losing his temper. calling me worthless, saying i have no friends, i am a cunt. he tells me to shut the fuck up multiple times a day when i bring up anything but positivity. i just had an appointment with my plastic surgeon, and he said there is nothing he can do but let it heal, deal with the broken nose until  months. so i have to wear this embarrassment through the holidays. he enrolled in anger management but i am so scared. i am unhappy. i have made him stay in hotels before because it got so bad but it is still not improved. we have a great connection when things are good. that is my dilemma, and my family shame. also i am , and in la. i will never find anyone else."
"i don't have my proper license that allows me to drive myself. but it was late and i was craving coffee in the middle of the night cuz apparently thats what i am now (i only drink coffee out of necessity literally have never had any desire for it???). anyways everyone's asleep theres five dollars right beside me, i was angsty, the stars were fucking aligned okay. so i whisper walk my ass downstairs and grab the keys. i open my garage (not connected to my house so no one could hear - for all you overthinking mfs out there) and get in the car. at first it was normal i drove got my coffee whatever. but as i was coming home lights by ellie goulding came on and i got fucked up. i missed the turn into my neighborhood and was like might as well jam out since i never get too (always driving with one of my family members who start screeching when the car starts to move). the thing about me is that limits just don't seem to exist, meaning i cannot comprehend what ""too much"".  so i start speeding sis. like  mph type shit in a neighborhood. at this point im just singing bops (blank space, work, freaking starships like cmon). im not lying when i just straight up thought every radio station caught on fire because of the flames being spit out at me. i decide its time to go home but mind you im still lit as fuck. so im going probably  or something and i decide ""this is a good speed to turn"". right when i moved the steering . cm the only thought in my mind was ""well thats done"". the fattest skrrtt i have ever heard in my life is annihilating my ears. the road of my neighborhood is pretty big so i make the turn in without hitting anything. but as im on the road im whilly fucking nilly, going left and right. at this point im screaming not from fear but pain since my shoulder is fucked from a skateboarding injury that happened yesterday and i was moving it all vigorously to you know, not die. anyways i press the brakes and my heart is pounding whilst my car is horizontal on the road. i instantly start laughing because apparently im edgy which i was not aware of and death is funny haha owo.  i pull into my driveway after calming down. get inside and am welcomed by my cat staring at me with a disappointed look. go upstairs and everyone is still asleep unaware of the insurance hike i was about to cause, and also me potentially being painted onto the road. and that's my ted talk on why you should steal your car since you probably wont die."
so i took a  minute cold shower.
"dogs in training. any type of training but dogs who are fearful, reactive, or aggressive towards other dogs typically (and hopefully) have humans who walk them in on-leash designated areas with a level of traffic the dog can handle. dogs with aggression issues may well be being walked in a muzzle making them incapable of defending themselves. they deserve to walk safely and in peace and not to have their training setback as do all dogs."
"we are mid service and this guy is completely lost. it's so busy, lessons are over now. i think we've all been in a spot like this where it's just easier to go into overdrive and power thru rather than show this guy how to do everything."
"have fun with your new toy.  my girlfriend and i have had so many good times touring new neighborhoods and small towns since buying scooters at the first of the year.  you will too, but just be smart and safe.  you will quickly learn that you have to watch out for others as much or more than doing something wrong yourself."
"its like there are no rules at all, as long as you dont crash just keep going and hope you dont run over a drunk electric scooter user."
it’s an electric skateboard and yes it has a speedo and i fell almost immediately a dog ran in front of my skateboard (don’t worry the dog is fine only a minor injury) and i didn’t even have time to react and because the dog took out my legs my upper body flipped around sending my shoulder and torso into the floor very quickly and i don’t really care too much about accuracy i just wanted an estimate of how much force was needed to fracture my shoulder
"i see a lot of people say her (barely!) surviving cheapened the finale, but i don't see a lot of people consider the consequences of her injuries. she's young but that was absolutely brutal."
"ngl, i think we need good, like experienced, skaters but as helpers, not as an example piece."
"by day  the skateboard has made it to b, it got a paint job as a reward and the client couldn't be happier. the car is now rolling off the production line, but the client is already at b and has no reason to need a car."
a hot shower.
my friend was on the scooter that was hit this morning (/) - she'll be ok but is in the hospital.  she's hoping someone got the accident on dashcam video.  please holler if you saw it happen!
toughest nut to crack will be tsla imo. but the reward is going to be so fucking tasty.
"without a crash/stunt cage and a skateboard strapped to it, this is just -wheeled insanity."
same speed limit applies for all on of those vehicles on a footpath. dude was going way faster than km/h and should be dealt some form of punishment.
"because of my endometriosis i have pelvic pain, uterus pain, sciatica pain, lower back pain, arms and legs aching, severe bloating, exhaustion, urgency to urinate all day and night, diarrhoea, and nausea. i had a laparoscopy to diagnose and remove the endo, though it began to present again two years later as it began to grow back. when i woke up from the procedure i  had horrible pain from the gas they used settling  in my shoulders; it was actually terrifying to wake up to. i also got a post-op blood infection a few days later and was rushed to the hospital to get alot of antibiotics injected. i did manage to get pregnant at  despite the endo and had a great birth except that my placenta was retained because of endo tissue attaching the placenta to my uterus wall. i lost . litres of blood that day and almost died. i had to have a blood transfusion before they could put me to sleep in order to go in and get the placenta out to stop the haemorrhaging.  also, i have had diarrhoea since then. i had another coil put in  months after birth because i had symptoms coming back. i was awake, again. this time was even more painful. my body went into a state of shock and my uterus contracted all day and into the night. just barbaric. was better though, than waiting for surgery with all my endo symptoms coming back. on top of this, my knees have been dislocating on the regular since i was  (i’m thirty now) and i’m certain that my nerves are crushed  and the cartilage is worn down. i get aching all through my legs constantly and sharp pain in my knees. furthermore, for the last  years i’ve noticed this one spot on the right side of my mid/upper spine that hurts. it’s like really sharp but also aching pain. it feels like a fireball in that spot. one time my friend was massaging me casually and she noticed that spot was a bit swollen. it’s progressively gotten worse over the five years and now i’m noticing a lot of other concerning symptoms. the muscle all down the right spine has been chronically spasming. all day, every day. laying on the shakti mat feels like my muscle is alive because i can feel it squirming (contracting) up and down my back. the pain is spreading from this one spot on my spine into my right shoulder, right side of my neck, right arm arm and right leg. i have muscle weakness and fatigue in the arm and leg too. it’s just all aching all day every day. the og pain spot in my spine is sharp, hot and constant. the skin on that area is numb to the touch which is weird. it also often feels itchy. everything feels connected to that spot. now the back of my right rib is in agony i can’t even breath in fully without sharp pain there and mid spine. it feels like there is so much tension and pressure in the right hand side of my body. i’ve recently been wondering about why i get a recurring large ulcer on the right side of my tongue and always in the exact same spot. like  times last year. my right eye is always painful and itchy. is there something wrong with the right side of my body?? i also haven’t had a solid shit in almost two years. the sciatic pain in my right ass has been intense lately also. my theories have been that.  i have a crushed nerve in my spine because of an old skateboarding injury from like  years ago. . that i have endometriosis growing in that spot on my spine. . arthritis of some kind. my doctor is amazing in trying to help me figure out what’s wrong. i recently went to him and presented him with all of my symptoms and he has ordered two sets of extensive blood tests trying to see what it might be. so far it’s all come back normal except for slightly high cholesterol lmao. while i’m glad i don’t have any of the nasty stuff he tested for, it feels frustrating to not have a diagnosis. he has recently referred me to get a bone scan with nuclear medicine done which is next week. i’m really looking forward to seeing what comes up in that scan. apparently it can pick up a lot, including infection. since i went to the doc a couple months ago, my pain has gotten much worse and the weakness in my arm and leg is making it difficult to hold my baby and generally do what i need to during the day. my doc recently prescribed norflex for my spasm which was no doubt causing a lot of the pain and pressure. it really helped to relax my muscles and it felt so relieving at first but then all of these other newish pains came up under where those muscles are. like new sharp rib and spine pains. also my right forearm feels like the muscle is being ripped or something when i stretch or extend it out even slightly. what the shit guys. i’m sick of being in all kind of pain for my whole life. i’m just sick of it. also i can’t be on norflex long term it makes me feel high, i need to parent. i usually make myself cannabis infused coconut oil and take pregabalin.thank you for getting it this far in my venting session. i just feel like a broken record with this stuff to those closest to me, so i’m giving it to the internet abyss."

"i didn’t let my youngest son play football because i didn’t want him injured. i was working a saturday sports med clinic at the time.  when he was  y.o. he was at the high school game, he and his friends were playing and one of them jumped on his back as he was climbing a hill - when they brought him to me he told me  “my ankle bends, but not where its supposed to!”. ( tib-fib fx). when he was in th grade attending the homecoming game i got a call from a paramedic to tell me that ‘because of the speed the car was traveling at, and the distance he was thrown they were transporting to hospital- but there was no sign of head injury, he’s alert, oriented x.’.  he had callled me and handed the phone to the emt with no explanation after he was hit while crossing the highway to the high school for the game. you need to do what you think is right because you will live with the decision but - its not that easy to protect your kids. side note- when er doc asked how he was able to survive the impact he said “ tuck and roll”. i did let him skateboard and it appears that the muscle memory of hundreds of falls from his board helped him escape more serious injuries when he was hit by a vehicle going  mph."
"hello everyone, i'm writing here because i have no idea what to doim a  year old male from north macedoniathe story starts when i was going down a street with my skateboard and tried to do a trick, the board went into the street (which is a busy street i might add) it went under the wheel of an uncoming car, didn't break, flipped like  meters in the air, and fell on the window of the taxi driver, made a crack about the size of a baseball glove on the passenger side, he stopped in the middle of the street and i went backi thought about running for it, but something stopped me, i gave him my facebook and my phone, and he told me he would call me tommorow and he added me as a friend. today is the next day, and i dont know if i have to pay for it all, if his insurance will pay it, is it my fault? or anything of any legal matteri would be much obliged to your advice :)"
"the biggest danger to bikes and e-scooters are cars. they did do a study and found e-scooters are  times more likely to get into an accident (.% per .km) but that was with an incredibly small sample size and e-scooters are a new thing so it could just be an anomaly, but i haven't looked into the study yet. also e-scooters are only allowed to go  km/h which is slower than what i used to do on a bike, sadly i can't do that anymore because of chronic health problems like chronic pain so it's mostly a mobility scooter for me."
and what's worse the vc world encourages this as it is stuffed with ideologues who have a dogmatic acrimony with big guvmint. barbrook called this the californian ideology in  and we are reaping the rewards of what happens when you prioritize an ideology over critical analysis. all they see are imagined problems and it just breaks shit
"first of all...my thanks once again for all the love and support i received here. it helped so much to know so many people were thinking of us. she has improved and is doing really well. she is still having headaches but they’re much less intense. she gets overwhelmed from sensory input more easily but this is normal, plus she has always been easily overstimulated. as a baby, i knew i had  minutes in any store before we had to be out of there lol. on to the good news! i only mentioned this in a reply to a comment during the accident posts, because it wasn’t about me, but i was diagnosed with breast cancer in august . i underwent chemo,  surgeries, radiation, and more chemo which finally ended in november . i’m considered in remission now. there’s an organization called little pink houses of hope that provides week-long beach vacations for breast cancer patients, their families, and their caregivers. i was chosen for one of these vacations!! we will receive a full week’s lodging, a $ gift card for food/activities, and a professional family photo shoot. normally they schedule activities all through the week, but due to covid they’re doing the gift card instead.i’m responsible for transportation, but thanks to the nd job i had taken on a couple of months ago, i have the money for plane tickets and a rental car, and some spending money as well!i’ll spare you the details, but we have had a lot of bad shit happening for the last two years in our lives. even right now we just found out our cat is dying. it’s just always something. but this vacation is going to be amazing. my sister was my main caregiver, and her boss is letting her take the week off, so she will be coming with us! i am so excited!the trip is going to be the last week in april, and we’ll be staying in carolina beach, nc. the date and place are chosen for us by the organization. i’ve never been to that beach, or done anything besides drive through a tiny part of nc on a road trip once, so i’m excited to get to see a new place! i don’t know what our lodging will look like yet but it will be a private unit with kitchen etc. my son is so dang sweet - he told me he’s willing to sleep on the couch if he has to so allie can have a room to herself. i’m a little nervous about flying because of covid, but my sister and i will be fully vaccinated by then, and the kids have had covid so hopefully they still have antibodies. i got some n masks from work for the plane ride. we’ll take all precautions to stay safe.as you can tell i’m so excited! lol. if you know anything about carolina beach or wilmington, give me pointers!"
"when it comes to the rentable ones i think a lot of the riders have only ridden one a few times at most, and almost all the time they've never ridden the specific scooter they're currently riding, which might have differences with brakes / acceleration / etc compared to the other ones in the fleet of whichever company they rent from. i think that's a big part of the problem. i imagine the majority of people who ride them safely either ride them a lot or have some applicable experience riding other things (skateboards, kick scooters, etc) in public spaces."

"point is, she’s reached a pivotal moment, and it’s time to take advantage of it. she hops on a pew—black moon primes the ends and the legs—and with a combination of those explosions and the footstep mines across the map, she propels the pew like a skateboard to speed around the church (and get new pews whenever needed). this makes her much faster, since she can afford to propel the pews with far more force than her own body!"

we got invited to a punk house after a show because these people needed a ride home. it was this old fucked up house covered in gig posters and toys and crap all over the place. it was dirty but really cool and the people that lived there were a bit older but super nice to us and kind of took us under their wings.

then again pop punkers and some skate punks were into skateboarding  in the s but it still not outweigh the hip hop influence and  skateboarding as a subculture wasn't as punk influenced overall like the s.
also don’t forget balance exercises…mount the euc while supported by a railing and just rock it back and forth to train your brain to find the points where the motor engages.  try to balance on one foot and see how long you can do it and do this for both legs.

our er nurse friend who works downtown says the most common friday and saturday incident is a scooter injury. people can get fucked up hard on those
"the scooter can go through every queue line at dca. it cannot go in every queue line at dl. instead, you can talk to the cast member standing at the exit of the ride. if you have a ll pass, the cast member will scan you there and let you walk to the ride via exit. if you don’t have a ll pass, they will give you a return pass with a time equivalent to the line’s current wait time minus  minutes. example: if peter pan’s current wait is  minutes, the cast member at the exit will give you a return pass for  mins from that moment and you have a  minute window to use it and walk to the ride via the exit."

"design completed, i ordered the remaining things i needed:"
"there are dedicated cycle lanes on % of all streets in denmark, and since a car hitting a bike has massive consequences (cars are almost always responsible in the eyes of the law, even if they weren't responsible for the real crash), the cars tend to be much more mindful. i myself am a car drive and e-skater, and i honestly feel safer on my skateboard than my car (apart from the fact that my skateboard has small wheels and wobbles alot lmao), so don't be scared at all to ride your bike, denmark is probably one of the safest, if not the actual safest country to ride your bike in. even on roads without dedicated cycle lanes, cars keep a good distance to your left, or stay behind you if they can't get past without getting too close etc. the driver's license training here is intense compared to some other countries like the us... danes are very good drivers and super mindful of their and your surroundings."
you mention a fight.  getting in a fight while wearing skates results in your injury.  (back to item #.)
not proper driving but on my electric scooter i often crash into bins because i’m speeding too much and i sometimes get beeped at by angry cars because i don’t check the left and right cars turning in somewhere. i went on holiday to new york and went on electric bike and i nearly died like  times
"i broke my right wrist in th grade. my grandparents lived at the very top of a cul-de-sac that had a pretty steep incline..well my older brother being my older brother, had taken something from me and in an attempt to retrieve whatever it was, i hopped onto his newly gifted electric scooter and started after him downhill... well said scooter only had a break on the front tire so when he abruptly stopped and i pulled the handle for the break, i promptly flew over the handlebars of the scooter and onto the asphalt. everyone was actually so much more concerned about the gash in my chin that we didn't realize my wrist was broken until about  minutes later when the paramedics arrived (a concerned neighbor saw an ""un-helmeted"" child crash onto the road outside of their house and called )."
here's the list of things that cops would not be able to engage the occupants of the car about anymore:
helpful thread for routes
obviously the choice is yours  i’m just trying to impart a bit of wisdom gathered over years and many thousands of miles of riding these electric scooters many people also find that they enjoy riding scooters and having one that you can go out for a long relaxing cruise on is a bonus of getting one with a longer range  .
i still have my teeth after drunkenly crashing an electric scooter.  my shoulder still hurts a bit though.
"i fell off my electric skateboard yesterday because the backwheels blocked. i fell on my back with full speed (kmh) and hit my head on the floor. i had a loud ringing sound in my ears, was a bit dizzy and lost my ability to smell and taste after the hit. i went to the hospital right away and they made some tests. no concussion! i'm on painkillers right now and still got some neck and head pain. this happend yesterday and i still can't smell or taste wich makes me a bit anxious. would love to hear some advice or tips what i can do or if someone had a same problem did your ability to smell came back?"
"they are a dog. a normal dog with normal social preferences out for a walk. the vast majority of dogs, particularly socially mature adult dogs, do not want to romp with every dog that crosses their path & very few dogs do well being rushed by off-leash dogs when they are on leash. that’s it. there does not have to be anything at all wrong with or out of the ordinary about a dog for them not to want unknown dogs rushing up to them in public, on-leash designated areas. that’s not an example of what appropriate social interaction looks like. period."
"now, i wouldn't recommend that everyone take up my lifestyle. it's not a big deal to wear a helmet or some protective gear. but, work on being aware of your surroundings. study the terrain that you will travel. know your body and scooter."

"let me start by saying that i have no idea how to work with the legal system at all. there are so many people i should have sued but didn't. i have been hit so many times by cars, trucks, suv's, even buses...more than  times (no serious damage has ever been done to me. i have ways of avoiding it thus far.). you'd think by now i woulda learned how to take some legal action... nope. i'm dumb as a bundle of broken bricks. with that being said, i have a friend who is always asking me for advice on stuff that i just don't care about. ""why can't i walk up to the drive thru window?"" uh....kuz safety...? ""why do i have to pay rent when i have no money? how do they expect me to pay?"" well...maybe you shouldn't have bought that $ apple product when you haven't paid off the last  that you had to put in pawn, you could pay your rent!? ""i need it for my mental health!"" .....i'm sure you need a roof over your head more... just stuff like that... and he thinks the world owes him kuz he's legally blind... (he has very limited vision and gets mad at people who don't automatically do things for him such as move on the bus. he doesn't wear glasses and he doesn't have a sight cane.) he just called me up and we ended the call a few minutes ago about how the company he got his electric skateboard from won't give him a refund. here's about how things went...since i don't listen to more than half the crap that comes out of his mouth as it's all repeats of what he just said in like  different ways...so this is just the key details and hi-lights...or we'd be here all night... a  minute called lasted over an hour...ef- i don't get why they can't give me a refund. they sent me a new battery and it still doesn't work. they sent me an email saying that they could send me another battery since the vids i sent them apparently weren't enough.me- okay. send me the vids and i'll see if they missed something. i'm not sure what you're talking about since i don't know what you got. if you could send me a pic or a vid, maybe i could help you figure out the problem.ef- they just said that what i sent them says the product works just fine, but it doesn't! it's defective!me- okay...send me what you're talking about and i'll see if i can help.ef- it's an electric skateboard.me- okay...is there a specific model? did you buy it from a company? maybe the charge port isn't connected to the battery correctly?ef- the charge port is on the battery itself! why would it be anywhere else?me- then send me what you got! i don't have anything new or electric! i don't know about this shit! how can i help if i don't even know wtf you're talking about!ef- what do you need to know. it's an electric skateboard. pretty self-explanatory i'd say.me- i'm hanging up.ef- there, i sent it. i sent you the site. take a look for yourself!me- thanks ass... (take a few to check out the site.) okay. what one did you buy?ef- i got (model).me- okay...there's  on here that say that but all look different. what one did you get?ef- (sends pic) this one.me- okay. let me take a look.ef- what are you looking for?me- the battery, what it's supposed to look like, what the charge port looks like.ef- the charge port is under the red cover. you're not going to be able to see it from the pictures on the site.me- okay. then can you send me a pic of yours?ef- why do you need that?me- ...you're right. i don't need it. was it perhaps plugged into an extension cord? sometimes that can half the power of the charge or cause other issues. i have some lights that don't work if plugged into an extension cord.ef- it was plugged into the wall. and why would it matter if it was. it shouldn't make a difference.me- ....yeah...you're right.ef- how do i sue a company. they won't give me a refund for a defective product.me- dude...no idea.ef- you have so much more experience, but you don't know how to do that?me- you're a grown ass adult! i'm only  years older than you. figure it out yourself! i've never tried to sue anyone! i don't go buying shit online all the time and putting myself in debt and then trying to make it other people's problem!ef- i'm only asking if you know how to sue someone. it's not like i'm asking you to get rid of a body for me!me- that- i could probably help you with! this- not so much! how many items do you have in pawn? last i heard was  items... here's a thought! pay your bills first, worry about your electronics later, and then get stuff that ""betters your life""! if you don't want to take my advice, that's on you. don't come crying to me every time you get pissed that things don't go your way!ef- jeeze. no reason to blow up on me. you don't need to be a bitch when i'm only asking for a little help!me- dude...you said this would take  mins. it's been almost an hour! they are trying to work with you. you gave them vids that you haven't sent me so i can't tell you if they are being fair or not! this just sounds like buyers remorse to me.ef- thier product doesn't work! they sent me a new battery that doesn't work! it's not holding a charge and they won't give me a refund! it's their fault for selling something that doesn't work! i want my money back and they won't send it! they say nothing is wrong in the vids that i sent! how do i sue them? that's all i'm asking for help with!me- i can't help you with that! you can send me the vids and i can look 'em over, but i can't help you.ef- well thanks! some ""friend"" you are!me- dude...eat a dick...(slight trigger warning-suicidal ideations)i've cut him out of my life before but this guy's like gonorrhea! he keeps coming back... keeps guilting me into staying his ""friend"" and it makes me sick... i didn't talk to him for  years then he comes back with ""i'm feeling like i should just die and make everyone's life easier. everyone leaves me or is toxic in my life. even my own mother won't talk to me anymore. she said i got myself into this situation and that i need to figure it out myself!"" ....uh...well yeah. you did do it to yourself! maybe you should see a therapist! people don't owe you things just because you feel you deserve it. this is the same ""blind man"" who crashed at my place one night back in  and wasn't using headphones while watching p\*rn on his three screens. ipad, laptop and his cell... at the same time...with the volume on!!! it was disgusting! and he had the nerve to get offended when i asked him to turn it off. b\*tch! it's my place! you wana do that, do it elsewhere! then a week later he got mad when someone asked him to not watch p\*rn on his laptop on the bus with their child sitting right next to him. he got offended for someone asking him to not watch p\*rn while sitting next to a litteral child! i just don't know how to keep this asshole out of my life... i'm losing my mind... i'm a class s asshole myself and only have about  friends across the entire us...an this includes this moron... i'm so sick of his entitlement. then he says that i'm a narcissist because i don't want to deal with his shit! don't make your prolems mine!!! bleh...sorry for the rant..."
"not sure what was going on with that last one.... was expecting another scooter crash, not crashing into a building...."
"i'm asking because i'm sure helmets can reduce cyclists head injury, but only in some specific cases, like children that fall over, mountain bikes, old people that fall over etc. i myself use an electric skateboard so i always wear a helmet, but it is in case i fall over. the thing in cities is that what is killing cyclists is not ""fall over"" it's a car or a truck or a bus that runs over them, and in that case a helmet is no protection at all, but creates an ""idea"" of protection, thus making accident more frequent i'm almost certain: just see how drivers think helmet are protecting cyclists and get mad about cyclists not wearing them. they just don't understand what a helmet is. thus not wearing them when they will not protect you is a way to educate drivers."
i owned both an electric skateboard and onewheel. i sold the electric skateboard and kept the onewheel. now with + miles and no major injuries. my boardsport experience was very limited before the onewheel.

"last summer i was skating down in an alley. i kind of disassociated while skating. i didn’t even have to push myself forwards to skate, it was just rolling and rolling. meanwhile i disassociated i didn’t realize that the alley i was rolling on was tilting more downwards and even more downwards. i noticed a dead end too, and when i came back to reality, i realized i was skating so fast and i had no idea how to stop in my tracks. i was panicking so hard because i put my foot down  times and it got scraped by the ground so hard, i knew it was gonna end up bad. i didn’t wanna crash into the dead end so i jumped off the skateboard (i had no idea what to do, i was still a beginner skater) and i rolled like  times, scraped my left hip, and landed on my right arm. luckily i had gear on, but i still have complications with my right arm til this day…"
"sorry if my english is bad, it's not my primary laungage. this all happened just yesterday and my mom told me that i have no rights to be upset about it. i (m) have  siblings (f and m). my brother was inside playing and i were playing tf when my sister asked me if she could go around with the electric scooter outside while staying on the property, i said: ""sure"" since i wasn't paying attention to the outside i had no idea that my sister and my aunt (f) were outside the property. they left at : and came home at : so i shrugged it off cause the battery might have died. half an hour goes by and my parents arrive so welcome them back and when my grandma and aunt leave my mother goes to the toilet when she notices something strange. half of the scooter's steering is broken off and had superglue on it that melted a couple mechanics that made it very hard to repair. my mom called me and my sister to explained what happened and i told her: ""i didn't even know it broke"" so she turns to my sister and asks what happened. she bursts into tears and tries to explain what happened but my mom told her: ""she can't explain it and she should be thinking about how she's going to pay me back."" my step father was furious too since he bought the scooter in the first place. my sister got grounded but not even after  hours she got everything back my took away from her and when i asked: ""why?"" she just said: ""i am your mother and i know what to do."" right now i'm thinking about why is she giving her electronics back after  hours but my ones take days or even a week to be given back because i forgot  chore.(i'm sure this will probably end up in a tiktok video of someone doing minecraft parkour or subway surfers while a text-to-speech male/female voice is reading it.)reddit, aita?"

"imo, if wearing a full suit is a requirement, i don't think commuting by bike/scooter/skateboard is a good idea. you should be considering your safety - a suit will likely not protect you if you get into an accident...and if it's a nice suit, it won't stay nice, lol. wearing knee and elbow pads would also wrinkle the suit, which would defeat the point of wearing it."

"then, i started the fender design. i went through several iterations. the fender thickness was dependent on how many cells i would place in it and how they were laid out. working with sanyo ga cells (.v - mah), i needed  cells in series to match the v of the stock battery. playing with reasonably thick design, i could lay out  cells in parallel, resulting in a sp battery pack, v - .ah. the cells are laid out horizontally along the fender curve, with a slight offset to form a www pattern."
"**name:** rudy “tech” nichole**age:** **gender:** female**species:** sea urchin**occupation:** fast food worker, trying to go pro in turf wars on the side**family:** has a brother! also parents! two of them!&#xb;————————————————————————— &#xb;**appearance:**tech stands at about  feet,  and-a-half inches. her build is fairly lithe. her eyes are a bright yellow with dark green pupils of like her spines-- one often sees them crinkled up in an impish grin or in raucous laughter. she has greenish-black spines, short towards the front and long towards the back, forming a sort of spiny ponytail. some of the spines are broken at the tips or at irregular lengths, the lingering results of many skateboard crashes and hasty repair jobs.she’ll often be seen in these sorts of tops:* big, loose hoodies, may have small holes/rips at the back of the hood* t-shirts* jean jackets* belly tops* the rare plaid jacket (for formal wear! not anything else! that’s nerd shit!)and these sorts of bottoms:* distressed jeans* skirts-over-pants* occasionally goth-esque stuff?&#xb;**personality:**tech’s high school graduation photos ought to be stapled to the definition of “goblin” in every dictionary ever published. loud, obnoxious and proud of both, this urchin’s presence makes every social situation that much more chaotic. her appearance seems to fit every definition of a stereotypical bully, and at first glance her personality seems to live up to that; her cockiness and harsh putdowns hardly help things.ultimately, though, she’s is a pretty mundane antagonist. it’s rare to see tech actually get angry in any situation— her skateboard crashes usually leave her laughing hard, and insulting her will usually just earn a jeering response or some backhanded praise. she’s more like an overgrown child, or that one acquaintance you tolerate despite how much they get on your nerves. if one can manage to put up with her, it’s hard to ignore that dynamic element she brings to the table.&#xb;**backstory:**back when tech was just rudy, the life she lived growing up was fairly unremarkable. the part of the city they lived in was fairly far away from any parks or other outdoorsy scenery, and with the rest of her family busy— her parents both worked at the office job they met at, and her brother was off trying to find some success with his undergound band— rudy found herself walking alone to the places she wanted to go. this naturally led to her bringing friends along on her outings, one of whom introduced her to something she hadn’t ever been to before… t h e  s k a t e  p a r k .it was cool… it was physical, *flashy,* it was… kinda nearby! rudy immediately found herself hooked on the hobby, and it wasn’t long before she was nagging her parents for a skateboard of her own. once she received it, that was it— she began spending practically all of her free time (and a few skipped school periods) at that skate park, building up new friendships and practicing as often as she could, and, years later, eventually entering amateur skateboarding contests here and there. it began to occur to her that she was improving quickly… she had a chance at going pro, if she just kept at it. well, maybe. that realization was about half a year ago now, and with high school just recently wrapped up, there’s been an increasing amount of pressure from her parents to “get a real job” and support the household. a bunch of her skateboarding pals have moved on into budding careers of their own, taking up internships and working at fast-food joints. something like that could help keep her afloat while she practiced on the side……but, *cod*, stuff like that’s so *boring*! it’s just like school!it’s that sort of thinking that’s made the recent grizzco advertising catch her eye. turf wars are a *lot* more relevant than skateboarding right now, and that means that recruiting is all the rage. if she can bring her current skills to the table and support herself with *that*……yeah…yeah, that sounds like a *fantastic* idea.—————————————————————————signup tab found here:"

"with the cheaper models, they may be slower but they're also more portable, cheaper to replace. you might pass on them initially because they don't compete with a car or motor scooter, but without full motorcycle gear you may not want to after your first low speed crash. they shake hard and are pretty unstable at higher speed, aren't very visible to traffic, and the higher speeds make sidewalks a firm no-go because a pedestrian, stick or crack will dump you."
"in saying this, you’d therefore expect that ppl wouldn’t crash in the emergency stop test - after all, it’s in a straight line - id say at least % of crashes on the course come from this one exercise or a relation thereof. just because you can do it, doesn’t mean a single mum who’s  years old, who’s never been on a skateboard let alone a bike - can…"
the majority of my classes next year will be at scrips and i’m looking into getting an electric scooter to help me get around. i figure it’s better to invest in one than have to rely on the bus. i am putting my self through college so i’m looking for an affordable scooter that can get the job done. any suggestions/recommendations?
"most of s skateboarding was leaning street and became mostly disconnected from hardcore punk and almost entirely hip hop influenced in some way. your average street skater in  was looking more like a nu metal kid with baggy phat xxxl  khaki pants, goatees, sideways baseball caps, long baggy white shirts and puma sneakers than anything from punk subculture."

"the physics of the scooter fall are very, very different than on a bike. on a scooter, you fall towards the front most of the time (unless you are being hit by a vehicle); thus, if you value your upper extremities, face, and knees, you need the appropriate equipment. i had a friend that fell in an unagi at mph and had broken teeth and serious surgery to his chin."
"idk about you but i throw on elbow and knee pads from my skateboard days when i wanna do some fuckshit in the woods on my bike lol. helmet too. never gloves, that’s like sex with a condom; safer and less fun, plus less feeling. i’d probably crash more with gloves."

any sit down scooter is too wide to go in the bike lane. it’s so wide that it’s unsafe for them to pass a bike or a bike to pass them. the path is too narrow for such a wide vehicle. regardless if it’s electric or not.
"so this video from the verge bugged the heck out of me yesterday. it was titled ""electric scooters may not be around for long"" - straight clickbait for an e-scooter owner like me. turns out it it's entirely about ride share scooters and the business model thereof. the title is completely misleading. naturally i got out my flaming pitchfork and posted an angry comment telling them how inaccurate their title is, lol.[ course, google helpfully started filling my newsfeed with articles containing ""e scooter"" or ""electric scooter"" in the headline. turns out they're all doing it: conflating these hire/ride share e scooters in with all e scooters. it's pretty frustrating to be lumped in with the casual hire scooter riders, many of whom are idiots:[ single one of these articles is about complaints relating to rideshare e-scooters, but only say ""e-scooter"" in the title and throughout the article.a few of the articles talk about new regulations applying to ""both rideshare and privately owned"" but none of them give even a single example of any issue caused by a private owner of an e-scooter.why are we getting grouped in with these fools? most likely it's simple: headlines need to be short, and ""e scooters"" is shorter than ""rideshare scooters"".i feel like the difference between the two needs to be pointed out wherever we can so we aren't unduly restricted thanks to a bunch of moron casual hire scooter riders."

"and . million square feet of bike parking spaces, including racks, corrals, and secure bike parking, bike share, e-bike, and e-scooter docks, and other micromobility uses, so that citi bike access will finally stretch citywide and nearly every new york city block will host a bike parking spot;"
two questions:
"life as an air force cop,working stateside on air force bases, could best be compared to random episodes of the ""andy griffith show"" if mayberry occasionally also hosted  the rare episode of ""cops: drunk and stupid perps"".this of course means that the average  hour *day* shift is a *usually* a mix of boredom, traffic enforcement (usually in the school zones), the occasional traffic accident, the rare shoplifting call and the ever-fun enforcement of base rules/laws that the wing commander has passed down we focus on.this particular week (many years ago), being the second week of summer vacation for the local school kids, and right after a skateboarding injury incident in housing, it was passed down that we would be focusing on enforcement of base safety regs...  if you are riding a bike, you must be wearing a helmet.  if you are skateboarding or rollerskating, you must be wearing not only a helmet, but also knee-pads, elbow-pads and [wrist-braces]( several days of the week, we encountered various base kids breaking the rules, stopped them, explained the rules, noted the names/addresses of the rule breakers and more importantly their parents.  the kids were directed to walk home to get their proper equipment before returning to their fun.  warning notes were passed through military channels to the parents,reminding *them* of the rules and directions to enforce the laws with their kids or else face punishment themselves for not properly controlling their dependents.the occasional repeat offenders we'd actually pick up and escort to their parent's locations, home if possible, but all the way to their parent's work if needed to hand them off.  that usually stopped any further repeat offences from those particular kids.then there was joey. i'm fairly certain joey is currently a mid 's  member of his local occupy movement, angrily protesting something...  if not in jail somewhere.  he had the eternal ""fuck authority and rules, they don't apply to me"" mindset.we had stopped joey to brief him about needing his safety gear for his skateboard several times, including taking him home to his mom three times.  she was the standard oblivious mother who had no clue what kind of miscreant her spawn truly was, while his poor dad was deployed.so there we were, driving through housing on friday afternoon, having just turned onto one of the side streets from the main housing road...  up ahead... joey.  i flashed to having seen the movie [""snow day""]( and almost felt bad as my partner started driving towards him...  until joey shot us the bird and raced off on his skateboard that is.we leisurely followed (speed limit in housing is only  mph and this wasn't exactly any kind of code response), slowly catching up as he skateboarded for all he was worth...  kicking hard, popping sweet ollies off curbs and back up onto sidewalks... great moves for a  year old skater.then, just as we were about to pull alongside of him to remind him we already knew where he lived and that trying to run was silly, he tried to pop up onto one last curb... but did a flat-planted jump instead, causing him to land on his feet on the sidewalk, and his board to shoot straight down one of the [gaping storm drains]( we had in housing to handle the desert rains.we stopped and watched him curse a blue streak that probably taught my younger driver a few new words, then saw his shoulders slump as he turned toward us and started to move to back seat door...  only to see his shocked face as the door locked in front of him.  he looked up at us and i told him, ""well, no board means we don't have to take you home...  walk safe!""i'm pretty sure he was inventing new swear words as he yelled at us as we drove off laughing.(edit:  timeline clarification comment added to help any confused by my original less than perfectly clear writing.)"
"**platform(s):** console - almost certain it would have had to have been on the ps ps or original xbox**genre:** think tony hawk pro skater kind of game.**estimated year of release:** late 's early 's**graphics/art style:** same look and feel to tony hawk pro skater. same camera placements. same kinds of places you'd find in a standard skateboard/bmx game. nothing in particular that i can remember as far as locations.**notable characters:** i have zero idea.**notable gameplay mechanics:** when you crash off the board/bike you have a measurement of how injured you are. i think it used numbers to represent the injury and may have had something to indicate what part of your body was injured. i remember being able to have semi control over your body after crashing, you could move your body to get make the injury worse.**other details:** i may be completely wrong on it being a bmx/skateboard game but cant see it being any other due to the crashing part and the minimal i remember visually. i am certain that you had a measurement of how hurt you got and had some control over your body after crashing.i am certain it was on a demo disc of some sort. i remembering not ever playing the full game and being limited on what could be done. after a while it was just boring, at one point i remember getting into a competition to see who could rack up the worst injury after a crash."
instead they throw money at subsidizing grand projects like green planes and stuff like that while completely ignoring low-hanging fruit and building new highways and having still a lot of unelectrified rails. apparently our rails not being very electrified meant we had limited options in what model of trains we could buy which meant many years ago we had a giant scandal about our expensive  broken mainly ic trains we bought from italy that were massively delayed because they were so badly built they broke immediately upon beginning service. they learnt from that mistake and have continually been electrifying more and more rail since and is now trying again with ic electric boogaloo edition so we can finally take our ic trains out of service 💀. these grand political projects are a shit idea. if they didn't buy  trains at once we would never have had such terrible problems and burnt so much money.
"fortunately drunk teenagers are immortal, so they weren't seriously injured and were able to run off leaving me with a $ bill to fix my bike."
"cherries are here, so i know it's getting close to maple blossom season, but i'm all beat up from a skateboard crash and i dont wanna make the hike up the hill where i harvest unless i'm gonna come back with a big sack of buds.if you have these growing by you, are they full of flower buds yet?also, have you ever eaten maple blossoms, and if so, you got any favorite recipes to try?"
"as for nannying, that wouldn’t be much of a problem if e.g. you were only asked to keep an eye on an older kid for a few hours while they watch tv. but generally nannying demands much more than this and nannying is usually for younger children. caring for a young child in an environment that isn’t specifically adapted for you to do so is very challenging for someone who requires mobility aids."
"red uses her smoke to cloud the arena: this may work out better for us than for her. if she begins to release her smoke, while she’s visible ravee will move in early to punch red and plant tracking gel on her, allowing for her and winona to keep track of the racer as she moves about. red herself, however, will not have the same advantage and be effectively blinding herself to our location. that said, not being able to monitor her actions and the cars that scb produces is an issue, so ravee will try and get behind any smoke clouds she makes so she can properly scout red."
"😬“spoiler alert: i can see you, so can your taxi driver, whose going to call your name in a moment.”"
"my long and drawn out point is that most people who scream ""put on a helmet!"" on these clips have no idea what they're talking about and just think they know best"
"simultaneously any stand up scooter which is gas powered or bicycle which is gas powered should not be allowed. they’re too noisy, they smell bad, breathing in that smelly air is not healthy, and they go too fast."
"and “universal daylighting” — removing car parking to increase visibility and decrease the likelihood of a crash — at every one of new york city’s , intersections, and using this space for traffic-calming neckdowns, bike parking and micromobility docks, bus bulbs, and green space like tree pits and rain gardens;"
"in the meantime, winona is going to be using sotw to take car parts and mould them into a kind of body armor that she and ravee can use in order to get better defense against red’s ballistics. now, this isn’t easy to do while being stationary, which is why winona isn’t going to stand in one place. rather, she’ll be turning wrecked cars into gel and running through them, coating herself in gellified metal before turning it back to regular form, now shaped around her body. winona will also be collecting smaller pieces of shrapnel and shards of broken glass from the crash, turning her arms into gel for a moment to store these pieces inside herself. this will hurt, but with  end she’ll be able to hand it, and it’s not going to be staying there forever, she’s got a plan. lastly, she’ll turn anything not being used by her and ravee into gel, disabling it from being used by red for creating cars with scb. this goes for any of the crashed cars they drove past along the way as well."
"crashing on an electric scooter. lots of us little kids were riding down the coldesac (idk how to spell that) and this little motherfucker started doing a u turn in front of me, probably  feet away. so i swerved and went flying across the asphalt. it jammed my front teeth up my gums, absolutely wrecked my face, and i could hardly talk or spit the blood out."
"and talking about slowing down: i'm also impressed he actually breaks while still on the skateboard, instead of simply jumping off and let the skateboard crash into whatever was in front of him."

"p.s. if i sound like i am picky, it is because i have decidophobia (fear of making wrong decision or cannot make a decision). it only happens when i am having to make a purchase like this, something i will be using for years on end (hopefully)."
"the bigger problem to worry about is going to be stock car boy’s vehicle constructs. able to control  units at a time that have b speed and power, it won’t bode well for us to be hit. already, winona will have turned a number of cars into gel, making them unsavory for use, as well as several objects at the pit station. in spite of this, it is still best to have a plan for dealing with these vehicles. on ravee’s end, it will be much like how she deals with scb itself, using her ability to reflect attacks back at the vehicles and wreck them all over again due to their durability. high-powered car projectiles will be reflected rather than destroyed, in case they secretly hide a truckload of bullets or shrapnel."
"i was in a college program and had to be held back due to an electric scooter injury. i heard that the classes after me, during orientation get coached not to use electric scooters."
"every thing that has wheels from a skateboard and up that's on a public road has danger spelled all over it. however, the chances of crashing head first on an electric pole at km+ is more on a cc bike with bhp @k rpm is much bigger than that of having the same crash on a cc scooter with .bhp @k rpm."
hey. at least the tesla bros don't have to stress about their plates anymore.
make sure he wears a helmet though. my so got a concussion from almost getting hit by a car and crashing on one. with a helmet.
"funhouse funeral! - probably the easiest to mix up and vary due to its simplistic nature, and it’s marissa’s bread and butter! whenever lomo nears a patch of charge, marissa will detonate it, sending the man flying through the air! he’s not dead (not yet at least), as she bounces him from footstep mine to footstep mine like he’s in a demeted bouncy house! to finish the man off, she’ll make him land in some incredibly awkward, and embarrassing position. things such as splits, on his head, in a jumble of twister like limbs, snapping his spine on the edge of some pew, ect ect. as he’s likely already been worn down by the successive blasts, the final crash landing ought to do the rest!"
"i would like this community to focus on the thing that we're actually all here for. the onewheel. a cool self balancing electric skateboard that can tackle almost any terrain and get people outside. not arguing about helmets and safety, cuz the answer is obvious"

"i need some help with advanced mobility and thought it would be cool to open a discussion on it here instead of having it spread out all over the forum.so i've gotten really good at grapple launching/advanced grappling (thanks to /u/itsethereal 's stream/advice and /u/frothyomen 's guide), which is what i really wanted to learn how to do when i moved over to pc from ps. there's nothing quite like that feeling you get when it finally clicks and you're able to consistently launch yourself across a map at ~mph!but there's a catch, of course. what i didn't realize was that effective grappling is only one third of the equation to mastering pro-level mobility in tf. the other two parts are air strafing and bunny hopping, which are integral parts of maintaining the insane momentum that proper grappling gives you -- neither of which i can seem to get down.no doubt you've seen it before on a stream or guide - a pro-level player launches themselves like a projectile across the map and appears to be floating while they tap building tops/walls/the ground, making tiny microadjustments to their left/right movement as they go. i guess i missed that part originally, being too awestruck with the grapple launch.i've watched the two main guides (gamesager and frothyomen) pertaining to the subject multiple times, and have spent many hours practicing in private matches. i tried watching other streams and guides too, thinking i was missing something. i could bunnyhop back in cs .-. and team fortress , but when it comes to titanfall, i just can't get it all to connect for some reason. i think one of the big problems i'm having is that the game is so unbelievably fast that i lose control easily. a lot of the time when i do pull off a consecutive string of hops and keep the momentum going, i do so without being able to air strafe, so i crash into an intersection wall or a car or something because i'm essentially just barreling ahead with no real direction or control. it's like that youtube video of the kid on the skateboard crashing into the trashcans at top speed.. over and over.. :(on top of what i listed above, i've tried the following:- spent at least - hours in private matches practicing (mainly on eden, as frothyomen suggested)- changing crouch from toggle to hold (no luck, it's harder this way)- changing sprint from hold to auto (and back, it messes up your ability to air strafe)- walltapping to keep momentum: i haven't been able to get this totally under control yet either because i'm having so many issues with air strafing while holding momentum, but it does work sometimes when i can pull it off.- starting without a grapple: it's true that you don't need anything to start the momentum, just a sprint jump -> crouch -> jump, so i started trying it that way to figure it out from scratch. no luck. i can't consistently get more than  hops at a fast pace yet.i know that a lot of people are just going to say, ""practice, practice,"" which i agree with (and plan to keep doing), but i was also going to see if anyone had any other pointers when it came to learning this type of movement? do you change your keybinds to better accommodate momentum-building in tf? do you hold sprint all the time, or only when initially jumping? any other tips? is there something i'm missing?edit: thanks to everyone's helpful advice/links, i figured out what i was missing and am grappling / bunnyhopping / airstrafing like a boss now. :d"
fair point about the dedicated brakes.
"disclaimer: no way to stop when going downhill, except to crash, potentially mauling anything in your path."
"i don't think they should be ridden on the sidewalk but, at least legalized to be used in the bike lanes. would anybody want to start a petition to legalize electric skateboards in burnaby and other areas? if you disagree comment down below."
"when you go to a ride, they'll direct you on where to go and how it works. they'll also ask questions to get you to the right spot.

anyone can share their falls on an electric skateboard? like what caused it and what happened after the fall? seems scary going  to km on a board where you can fly off and hit the pavement. like to hear stories to know what i'm getting myself into when i buy an electric skateboard.

"my biggest advice to you is to get a knee scooter! so much easier to use than crutches. i was in tears every time i had to get to the bathroom on crutches, just because it’s so slow and annoying. plus with a knee scooter you don’t need to hold something in your hands to stand up, so you can do a little more around the house.i rented one from a pharmacy, but  i realized a lot of people buy them when they have an injury and then try to get rid of them. a neighbor saw me with mine and offered me hers for when my rental expires. if there’s a buy nothing group in your area you might be able to find one free. i got a bag for mine that fits on the handlebars (like a bike bag) so i can carry stuff around from room to room."
was discussing onewheeling with my brother and we got into an argument whether a onewheel was considered a competitor to electric skateboards.  would like to know y'all's opinion[view poll](
there's a lot of really great detail in the article. here it is bulleted out for those who don't want to read through it:
face paint.
internationally tsla is # bought gamestop is # this has been the report for as long as i’ve tracked it
"if your problem is space used for parking and traveling, motorcycles use significantly less space than cars, and are unequivocally a win. not as much of one as bicycles, but a win."
the speed difference is going to cause a serious injury to one of us at some point.
"and at least one -foot-long zone on every block for public utilities, package deliveries, electric freight loading and unloading, microdelivery cargo hubs, e-cargo bikes, for-hire-vehicle and taxi passenger pick-up and drop-off, and trash collection, so commercial deliveries and trash bags are off the sidewalk;"
"if a person wants to build a battery for their electric skateboard, do they have to have a battery management system chip on it, or, can they recharge the battery as  unit without it?  i was wondering what the most cost effective battery management system was, if it was necessary?"
"there are  specific things in my life that i can contribute to my injury. but it's hard to actually pinpoint what exactly did it. i used to skate, and for about  years i always had a skateboard in my trunk. so i got used to taking some pretty heavy spills. i also lifted weights in highschool and in college, and had aches and pains over the years from it. but no serious injuries or surgeries. then about  or  years ago i was involved in a pretty gnarly car accident. i got rear-ended by a drunk driver, while driving a little s chevy truck. i was a sitting duck, nothing i could do but watch it happen. stopped at a red light with a few vehicles in front of me, and i just happened to glance at my rear view mirror and noticed a car behind me with his signal on, like he was merging into a different lane to go around. only thing is, the guy was going too fast and didn't turn his car quick enough. it was determined, after the fact, he was traveling about  mph at impact."
let the airline know you may need assistance if you are going by yourself.
"always keep an eye at the road in front of you, consider boots as well to protect your ankles from banging against the side of the scooter (hella painful)."
"i looked around and saw the taxi driver getting out of his busted cab. i screamed and he looked over, “hey, it’s sam right? you okay?”"
"you might say, “i’ve seen a vehicle-to-vehicle collision on a mph road and it didn’t look too bad”, but what you’re seeing is a collision where the driver braked first so the actual speed at the time of collision might have only been -mph. if there’s no braking before impact, things are bad - like if the driver was drunk/distracted, or didn’t see a passenger/scooter emerging from behind an object etc."
"tried to take the bus home because my onewheel was low battery, the driver said no electric vehicles allowed and i had to walk home. i can't find anything on their website and was wondering if anyone knows anything about it."
this made me realize they could've literally flipped those stupid poles and the concrete wall. put the wall where the poles are and vise-versa. then you at least run the risk of bike/scooter/skateboard crashing into pedestrians vs cars into people.
"stock car boy punch-rushing either of the two is inadvisable. winona can use burn  u to set her -degree flames on him, while ravee can use her stand to throw any punches taken back. additionally, both winona and ravee have easy access to a flame-retardant material with which to deflect the heat created by stock car boy’s arms. stock car boy’s relatively low durability makes a counterpunch a worrying prospect for it, faced with two very skilled counter punchers."
"also, for all of this, i'm lumping mopeds and sit-down scooters in with motorcycles - read  cc as including mopeds in all of this. (sit-down scooters span all classes from  cc to... i think aprilia has a  cc one?) fundamentally, it doesn't matter much whether your  cc has pedals and a centrifugal clutch or cvt (moped), a flat floor and a cvt (scooter), a step-through frame and a manual transmission (underbone), or a step-over frame and a manual transmission (traditional motorcycle) for this discussion."
"yep. cos no one has been killed or at least seriously injured by a bicycle, skateboard, electric bike or monkey bike have they? kids, elderly, disabled (like blind or deaf people) use footpaths too. they should have the right to be free from the risk of injury or worse while walking on the footpath. i don't give two shits if you agree with me or not. i don't think any of these should be on footpaths. but you do you. let me know how you feel when someone gets injured."
"i love helmets and encourage them always, but when you won't really hurt anyone except yourself for not wearing them...a person can choose. not wearing your seatbelt in a car?"
i’ve been experiencing crashes almost every time i run through the city. is this happening to anyone else? does anyone know how i could solve this?
"in london, a number of electric rickshaws appeared and there was a couple of crashes, and the news picked up on this hysterically. so they cracked down on their power rating and banning them instead of recognising that they were the solution and might need some sort of smart or contextual electronic speed limit and basic licensing to not be operated dangerously."
"gonna be a freshmen this year, love shredding and was thinking of getting and electric board for college. it’s a hoisted stealth longboard unopened for  which is an incredible deal but i feel bad about spending that…the other issue is is that i don’t have a bike :/ so no other form of transport….."
the second trick would be falling. falling with mini pain and injury whatever the situation is the most important trick to have in order to progress.
ted: custom made of what?
i installed the tier app .  i don't know how to use it :( . someone please guide me !
i’d say ow is closer to a skateboard. you will fall it’s part of the game. some wipeouts will be less severe than others. most you will get up and keep going. of course higher speed equals higher risk of injury. but in any board sport you should expect to fall every now and then at least. more if your pushing limits.
here's a good documentary on old school skaters.
so the only improvement would be getting the skateboard/flat floorpan?
"i typed this up originally as a comment, but wanted to share here so that hopefully more people will see it.wear a helmet. it doesn't make you look stupid, and if it did, who gives a shit? aren't we all too old for that now? here's my favorite video to demonstrate why [i love helmets.]( see people post their wipeouts here and sometimes i cringe so hard at how close they come to head injuries. it really doesn't take much to sustain a head injury. i know a teenager who's suffered head trauma **twice** just from tipping over on his bicycle! now this yo suffers from cognitive dysfunction.head trauma in skateboarding is a very real risk, and [this is the very unfortunate possibility we all risk]( stepping onto a board without a helmet (this is depressing as shit.. but watch it).i work with adults with mental illness so severe they have to live in residential care facilities (rcfs). the people who suffer from tbi (traumatic brain injury) seem to struggle the most with frustration over their mental illness. they get so damn frustrated and mad at themselves every time they have trouble remembering a word, a person, an appointment. sudden explosive tempers and violence is also common in this demographic. as well as bizarre behavior/breaking of social norms in some tbi sufferers (doing 'tai chi' in the front yard with his pants/underwear around his ankles is one real-world example for someone i know).some of these people experience such drastic personality changes from their tbi that they've fallen out with most/all their family. some people with tbi lose the coordination to carry out simple tasks, like brushing their teeth or dressing themselves.it also presents itself as dementia-like symptoms and makes the individuals' lives so much more stressful, agitating, and aggressive. for some, it's just an inevitability that their brain will continue to become more and more dementia-addled and they will slowly lose any semblance of person-hood (losing memories, verbal communication, personality, continence, awareness...). that's when these people require a skilled nursing facility for the rest of their numbered days (dementia is a terrible way to go out...).it may be hot, it may look goofy, it may be annoying, but wear your damn helmet! don't let the stigma stop you from wearing a helmet. and help destigmatize protective gear in skateboarding by wearing it. would you not wear a seat belt because some random jackass might judge you? would you refuse to use a backup chute skydiving because someone said they're for pansies?don't give a shit what other people think, and wear a damn helmet to easily avoid a terrible outcome. if not for yourself, don't put your spouse, children, family, friends thru that. that's unbelievably selfish."
. i think electric skateboards would be fun to ride. i'm wondering how convenient it would be as opposed to a bike
"if you have a fender, put it on and make sure your socks are kinda thick and cover your ankles. a lot of first timers drop their back foot, leave the front on the sensor and the onewheel scrapes along your ankle as it rides away (and then stops… hopefully). oh speaking of stopping, the board will slide on its side and can actually travel into parked cars. definitely had to chase after it once or twice. (not ghosting, literally sliding)."
"and of course, also literally, to refer to wood."
"if you enjoy knee down fast riding, there’s no safer place to do it than at the track. invest in proper gear and you’ll be able to enjoy riding much more and keep yourself as injury free as possible."
"if we were to have smart scooters and more powerful e-bikes, and raise the speed limit to the residential one, the conversion to low cost personal transportation would be accelerated as it was in china and almost overnight our cities would be nicer. the transition would take only a few years."
"also, think of it like this, if you really dislike them so much, then try voting for more bike lanes and better public transportation, you will absolutely see less bikes, or even electric kick scooters (i have a segway ninebot max gp, goes  mph and i just plug it in my wall, and can throw it in my shopping cart at the grocery store with how small it is), on normal or main roads if there are more bike lane options, or even entire roads only for bikes/electric bicycles/electric kick scooters."
"higher speed (felt, not measured) no need to ride around hills to save battery anymore, which is perfect for san fransisco :)"
children laughing.
youre clearly too young to understand that but one day you will.
"i have a nice electric scooter than can be folded up and worn like a backpack and i was hoping to bring it with me to campus in the fall, i figured it would be more convenient than a bike and i wouldn't have problems with theft. i know bicycles on campus have to be licensed so is this something that i would be allowed to do?"
"i was in an accident, with my on a electric skateboard. i am in san fransisco, california, united states where the laws say i can ride if i am over , have a helmet, and the board doesn’t go over  watts. i was approaching a intersection with a traffic light, with my direction being green. as i was going through the intersection, a passenger car turned left on me and as a result of me expecting the car to stay still, i couldn’t stop and i hit the rear passenger window. (car was turning her left, my right, car was coming the opposite direction of me). as a result, i broke her passenger side rear window and i suffered lacerations to me elbow which required stitches. i did not lose consciousness or suffered any other major injures. who’s fault is this? i was on the road going about mph and there were no cars in front or behind me. the police report came out and said that i was at fault since i was riding too fast, but the limit only applies to crosswalks, bike lanes, and sidewalks.edit : location specification sf,ca —> san francisco, california, united states"
"which shops sell electric fast electric scooters for a good price can be any electric thing, scooter,bike,etc.i’m moving there soon and i need one."
"the most visible immediate changes have been with the team — in xavi’s first three games in charge barcelona have been playing with more confidence and intensity, pressing higher and harder, taking more risks, breaking forward with more players."

hi everyone. i’m looking into buying a e-board to commute around berlin. i’ve read articles saying it’s legal but other articles of people getting fined. is this recommended or is berlin not e-board friendly?thanks!
"so my electric skateboard broke a month ago and ordered a new esc in. i opened her up and found that both the last remaining capacitor of the  had vibrated off and this little cap metal thing exploded off lol. few months prior to the nd capacitor coming off, the first capacitor came off and i didn't think much of it and continued on going and to my surprise the thing went on strong for a few months on but then it broke lol.soy question is can i solder a long wire or something to both the terminals of the capacitor part on the circuit board to complete the circuitry or is it a little more technical than that?my new esc is coming next week so i don't rlly care if i completely mess the the old one up."

"the construction company is not going to sue your friend. it's doubtful he did any damage to the hose, and if he did, they'll just go through insurance. their recording is more injury/accident reporting; any incident of any magnitude needs to be recorded and documented in detail on a modern site. they're probably seeking a statement to close out the incident and ensure they don't have to deal with a lawsuit from your friend."
"i live in a apartment that has only  or  kids in it this comes in to play later. one day me my friend, that we will call (f) and annoying kid (ak) and entitled parent (ep) and ak were playing outside riding skateboards i recently had a skateboard accident before the incident and i was a little loose but my f said we should play tennis because i have  tennis rackets we played tennis for a little while then ak wanted to play basketball so my f and i shrugged our shoulders and said sure and ak was being cocky and said that he wanted to do him vs my f and i do we were like ok whatever and i was not letting him get the ball and score so whenever he got close (note i was still a little injured) i threw the ball to my f and he did the same with me and ak started getting angry and trying to pick another fight with me and btw he fights me all the time and it’s never my fault it’s just there is something that is supposed to happen but ak wants to change it back to the story and he throws his little sisters bike helmet at me and pushes me while i keep my cool because i was older than him by a year and i was more matured at the time and then we see ak’s dad come over and pulls him away from me because even though i was mature i still had a limit and that look on ak’s face when he got angry showed me that he was gonna push my limit again and when the ep walks over my face turned ghosted because she is the manager and she had the ability to kick me out of the apartment but she wasn’t that much of a karen to do that but if i “did something bad” she will give me a notice and i’m just going to point out that ak is a f#€%ing liar i have known him since we were five and i always got into trouble for what he does so when ep talks to ak she is pi pi pi pissssdahhh and after that she took ak to their house and yelled the $#!+ out of him while i get my f a cup of water and after we finish it we put it on my front porch so i could pick it up later and we sit on the porch and talk when ak’s  year old brother comes and makes structures with th plastic cups then while we go inside me house for a snack the little kid dropped the cups down my stairs btw i live in a apartment that is above another apartment so don’t get confused and when we come out i see the ep downstairs and i go downstairs with my f and she starts talking to me sayingep= why wouldn’t you give the ball to my son he said you stole it but then my f steps up and says f= we were just playing basketball but ak was not getting the ball because he wasn’t getting it while we were playing and in my mind i’m like ok this ep isn’t bad but she complains about everything after an argument with me and her son and the cups that my f and i put on my porch were on the ground downstairs and we got in trouble for that and then my mom got involved and ep was saying some bs and the kid told my mom that because i was hurt from my skateboard injury i couldn’t play even though he didn’t say anything about me not being able to play basketball before we started and said i i stole the ball from him i was confused and i’m still confused  years later"

"i’ve wanted a ow for ages but i’m in my ’s and the risk of serious injury has made me decide that it’s just not for me (avid snowboarder). recently my wife said, hey if you’re not gonna get a onewheel, maybe get a skateboard or a longboard. this got me thinking, if my intent was to ride not much faster than i can run/skateboard, does risk of injury go away or does the balance/nosedive risk still exist just inherently? (i know that reducing speed would lower risk, i’m asking more if it would drastically change the risk)i plan to spend time carving more than anything else, even on the snow i don’t chase speed at all."
"that car isn’t being used by you after that. if you call me drunk at the party i’m picking you up, i’m not having you drive drunk. i’ll beat your ass another day, i can’t do that if you die in a car crash or kill someone else. moms gonna know the next day when you’re throwing up from your hangover. i will joke about this after the situation dies down with mom and i will roast you till the end of time for getting caught drinking at a party and having your dad pick you up like the cool kid you are. this will be brought up at your wedding to mess with the in-laws. i’m also gonna take the sick ass gaming computer i made you and if i’m really feeling it downgraded your iphone to like a blackberry or no phone at all. you’re not hanging out with friends and can’t do fun shit like skateboard or ride your bike. and no gym if you’ve been going before this.basically ima make your life ass for a while so you don’t forget while you live under our house don’t be doing stupid shit like drinking at a party underage."

"xavi’s first public statements as barcelona coach were a surprise for some who thought they knew him as a playmaker-philosopher mostly interested in complicated team tactics and perfect pitch surfaces. at his presentation he sounded a lot like an old-school british manager complaining that standards around the team had slipped since his days as a player, but making clear that nothing but maximum commitment and discipline would now be allowed."

"i will say i had wanted more of an insight into how she feels about anna’s passing than we really get, but this time around i did think the scene where she sets the cat on the mother rat protecting her babies, as if because she had “failed” to do this she can’t bear to see the rat make a go of it, did provide more of a glimpse than i gave credit for at first. so, there’s hardly a sour note to the film at all, full marks. this last thought i have is a bit random but one i always have relating to three colors blue that i'd like to share is having my money on julie hating believe by cher viscerally and throwing something whenever it comes on, and it always makes me laugh. i can see that chorus playing just terribly to someone exactly like her."
"i like arbor a lot, this board is quite playful for commuting. to pull off a trick or two while cruising around. it doesn't pump super great. nice pool shape. maybe you could read up on ldp (pushing and pumping style) and see if it's something for you. there are boards better suited for that. those are also very very stable so also beginner friendly, even the most professional ones. for me it's a complete workout for my core, legs and stamina."
"in my electric stand scooter that goes + miles per hour, i find myself to be the best in terms of not pissing ppl off and actually avoiding death once because someone cut me off and i couldn't break in time causing me to choose to crash into the person, risk hitting parked cars, or risk riding to oncoming traffic as i continue breaking."

"that should be enough to get you going - for the rest, you already all the motivation you need.  you like most have come to realize that every second you delay is another lost that you’ll never get back, and we’re only given so many of those in a lifetime to do as much good as we can with it."
"- e-bikes aren't as great for getting into and out of subway stations.  they are bigger than e-scooters, meaning they are more awkward to carry around.  they are heavier than normal bicycles because of the motor & battery.  i used to bike to the subway on my way home, and it was a nice exercise to get there, then to lift the bicycle over my shoulder to carry up/down stairs and over the turnstile (it's more acceptable to use the doors now).  but this was a non electric bike.  it's probably more of a chore to lug a heavier electric bike down the stairs."

i live in seattle and i’m fine with not riding while it’s actually raining but it seems like most companies are saying that a board can be damaged just from riding on wet ground which is most of the time here depending on the season. if i want to actually get good use out of an electric skateboard am i just out of luck?

"our study suggests that e-bike–related trauma may involve serious injuries and have typical injury patterns that resemble those seen in motorcycle-related injuries. children are more likely to suffer head and face injuries because of their higher head to body ratio. we suggest that these injuries should therefore be triaged appropriately, preferably to a medical facility with proper trauma capabilities."

"what do i mean by annoying? i mean like people talking in high pitched fast talking voices, shouting, and the ""ughh whatever!"" kind of attitude. it was just very big and loud. it was just everywhere in commercials in the s. don't get me wrong i love the s. i just feel like maybe there were people who were out of touch up in corporate or advertising. they may have thought ""oh yeah the kids will love that!"" maybe it appealed to people back then. looking back on it now it just seems like someone with a sugar rush made a commercial. the skateboarding, crashing through walls, etc. didn't bother me as much. the reason why i brought this up is i was watching a video of someone playing you don't know jack head rush. it got me thinking about this."
"i want to quit but i’m in a bad spot in my life. i had a . year situationship that used to be a relationship end in a very nasty way. i’m very isolated and other than a casual partner who is constantly on vacation, i don’t see anyone. on top of that i recently had to go no contact with my mother, and i was in a pretty bad electric scooter accident that put me in the hospital with over forty stitches in my face, broke both my hands, and gave me about k medical debt.i’m just constantly stressed out and depressed and upset, i want to stop drinking but it’s all i can do to just have a regular sober day where i don’t have some kind of breakdown."
"and yes you get firefighters when you call  for a medical.  we are all emts and get there faster then the ambulance most of the time. often lifting a large patient is more then  paramedics can do.  also we can assist with medical care.  cpr works much better with  or  people. the paramedics can concentrate on giving meds, the egg etc if we are bagging, doing compressions and monitoring the and."

absolute piece of shit injuring that kid. i get that skateboarding can be a slight nuisance but most skaters are generally respectful and also don't want to crash into anybody or break anything. this man straight up assaulted a kid because he was going for a trick where he shouldn't be. if you want kids off your property just have the police tell them to go. it's not a crime.
apparently neither can you
i've used both but am curious about any experiences or opinions you guys might have.
"electric scooters are less safe. rarely anyone ever wears a helmet, so you'll probably eat shit, especially on the roads of berkeley. that said, don't even think about an electric skateboard, cus you'll definitely eat shit. so make sure you use bike lanes as much as possible, get a bell, and proper light."

i'm trying to upgrade by battery pack with a hoverboard battery i salvaged but it doesn't have a balance like charging wire. can i just solder two wires on the output wires or do i need to solder a charging wire straight onto the bms of the battery pack. i have been looking online and it seems like nobody has done this before.
"i only skate vert but last couple days, tbi stories have made me want to quit this shit all together. is it even worth it?"
"the scooters are small and all the noise is at ground level, which makes it near impossible for anyone on a bike to pick it out. its bad enough when speed bros zoom past you without saying so, and that's a bike: a mechanical gyroscope. the e scooters are worse: less stable and higher speed, no mechanical stability from a gyroscope."
"they clearly survive in some places, unless pittsburgh is a test city for them. i don't have an opinion, but i think riding them without a helmet is really dumb."
"most objects that cause a crash are in front of you, so i wouldn't fixate on peripheral vision. the bicycle and motorcycle helmet standards all require a pretty respectable field of view (it's supposed to provide unobstructed vision, at least if you look ahead), and that's fine for eucs."

actress lisa banes critically injured in hit-and-run scooter accident
"back in september of this year i was riding one of those electric scooters on a whim. i was wearing shorts and birkenstocks and a tshirt because it was a random impulse thing for my friend and i. we had made it a couple blocks but my scooter would. not. slow. down. like i was pushing the brake but it was broken or something. eventually i lost control and flew off, sliding nine feet down the sidewalk. horrible road rash everywhere. the left side of my face, my left ear, left shoulder, completely covered  both of my knees, and almost tore away an entire part of my right palm. i landed on my left side and dislocated my left shoulder and broke my left elbow. the cherry on top? i’m left handed. i’m only  ( at the time) and still live with my parents. i called my mom as i sat on the cold ass ground concrete. she’s a doctor and i was very clearly in shock, so i was weirdly calm. she didn’t believe me until my friend sent her a picture and asked if we should go to the e.r. mom worked in the e.r for  years and she knows the workings well. she said i would probably have to wait for a room forever and also covid would require me to wear a mask over my open wounds, so she just said come home and we’ll go to her clinic in the morning where i won’t have to wait as long and could take the mask off in my room. my friend got me home and up the stairs with a blood trail dripping from all of the road rash. she bandaged me up and put my arm in a sling made of a sheet, gave me some painkillers and sleeping medicine, and laid me down in my bed, and told me to sleep. who the fuck is sleeping soundly after that?"
hitting every green light.
im not a doctor or therapist. i cant give you any guarantees. all i can say is what i felt worked for me. anything that requires you to balance across a wide range of motion is good.

well they’re meant for people who can’t move around due to injury or disability. in america it’s a bunch of obese people using them. i’ve had to ask people who are perfectly capable of walking to get off the scooter so i (who was injured and could not physically walk) could use it for its intended purposes.
electric unicycles can apparently go up curbs through sheer will. the massive pneumatic tire eats literally everything and the extra power makes maxing out much harder (but not impossible). i don't have experience with eucs but it's not too outlandish to assume that the forward facing stance keeps body straight and the knees in a better position to flex/dampen/absorb bumps and potholes without throwing your sideways balance off as much. conclusion: eucs are pretty gnarly but i don't really have much data.

"if you want to look cool, an esk or a onewheel ticks the boxes - and you can jump on and off without worrying about taking boots off.  and it's here where you see marketing coming into play.  i did have a onewheel for a year or so, did really like it, but didn't find the time to ride it; i'd prefer to be getting some exercise at the same time.  some esk companies have also crashed and burned from a badly algined marketing strategy."
"well no. the entirety of his trial that i watched from beginning to end (you can too if you want to avoid saying ignorant shit about it on the internet) convinced me and the jury that he wasn’t guilty of the crimes he was accused of. there’s a legal term called “acquittal” that’s pretty important here. not a technicality, not a mistrial. “not guilty” on all counts in a court of law where both sides had the opportunity to present evidence and examine all relevant witnesses."
a little over two months ago i fell off a scooter and landed on my left knee. both urgent care shortly after and the doctor who i saw recently said i likely have a bone bruise. my doctor also thinks i probably have a medial meniscus tear along with potentially a mcl tear and some sort of patellar tendon injury. i’m getting an mri next week and the week after i’m starting pt. does anyone have any idea of what to expect in terms of recovery or how this might impact me long term? also is there anything i can do to make the recovery smoother in the meantime? urgent care gave me a brace and crutches (which i haven’t really been using) and my doctor recommended to rice the injury. i’ve been doing that but i didn’t really get any other recommendations. i’m a  year old woman and i was pretty active before this injury so this whole thing has been very frustrating.

question : is there anything else that i should take into account before starting this adventure of learning downhill? any specific techniques that i should learn? should i give it more time before trying this? any general tips and tricks?
i got my first serious injury today after attempting a kickflip after ollieing off of a ramp at my local skatepark. i twerked my left knee pretty bad and was in a lot of pain for a while and it still really hurts. all i can think about is healing the fastest so i can go back and try the trick again. it hurt a lot when it happened. basically i landed it but the board slid out from under me and my right foot was still on it (i'm goofy so that was my front foot) and i basically did the splits but both of my knees were bent so they kind of got stretched out in an awkward position. i didn't feel anything tear or pop but i went numb pretty fast so idk. i don't feel like its broken so i feel like i shouldn't go to a doctor
"an electric bicycle maybe should be allowed and electric stand up scooter maybe  should be allowed, but they should not exceed the speed that can be achieved on a normal conventional bicycle. we shouldn’t be whizzing close by people at high speeds on the narrow bridge path, shouldn’t be being a nuisance on our electric stuff. for a couple reasons.  if you’re going crazy fast on a regular bike ok you’re a daredevil and you have some physical mastery over your body and the bike maybe you deserve it. if you go crazy fast on a electric vehicle next to human powered bicycles, you’re just a dick. let them enjoy their narrow bridge experience then when we all get off the bridge you can resume going higher speed. also remember the electric vehicles generally are less nimble, so passing a bicycle is sort of like driving a truck on the wrong side of the road to pass a sedan or something it’s dangerous. whereas a conventional bike usually can be more agile. also our machines are heavier. so if a crash does happen, there’s a higher chance of serious injury and remember the people you’re squeezing passed are innocent people they never asked for you to try this stunt. so it’s selfish of us to try to pass too, our machine is heavy and can hurt someone, more than a regular bike, so we better not crash it on some guy esp not some guy on a regular bike."
"hiya!i'll be doing a roadtrip through slovenia this summer and i will take my electric skateboard with me. was wondering what are the rules in slovenia for electric steps, skateboards, monowheels?are they allowed, are there any specific rules (max speed, allowed on public roads,...)many thanks!"
"it doesn't help this reminded me of my first crash which was a hit and run. unlike in the video where this guy could see the car for more than one second, i got hit on my side off a crosswalk sent flying into another street. car driver had a stop sign but you all know how we tend to roll into our stops. if only he wasn't going like  mph. only had a helmet at the time and yea, no matter what, you're not getting up from that impact. it's also very difficult to think rationally if you're still coincidence."

"f with two avulsion wounds on foot from a scooter accident that happened  weeks ago.  pic: [  am still in crutches and am unable to walk. the wounds are de-sloughed and packed daily (which always leaves me sobbing in paid). hydrogel is out of the question because it gave me a massive allergic reaction.besides the obvious injuries, my flexor hallucis longus below the wounds is extremely sensitive and hurts when i put even the slightest weight on it. in the days immediately after the accident, the pain was much more intense. sort of like a constant foot cramp. had an x-ray done, no fractures/broken bones.  i've several questions:. does daily de-sloughing and packing actually accelerate healing?. are there exercises i can do to be able to walk again soon?. what does the tendon have to do with the injuries at the top of my foot?thanks in advance!!"

"it's been just over  hours now.....been supplementing with loperamide -mgs - per day.  still freezing, sweating, depressed, lethargic, etc. i don't have my best friend who i've always ( years+) used and kicked with, he moved back to wisconsin.  i'm in a relatively small mountain town in the tahoe area with no car, no real close friends who care or that i could talk to, without screwing up other situations(job, etc).  i work -. days a week.  this last run has been almost a year of -. grams a day, with monthly week-long bouts of dilaudid and oxys. i'd like to transfer the addiction to the lope for a week, than do a week-long taper on the lope to get back to nothing.  i've kicked and relapsed many times, the longest being a forced cold-turkey from - mgs of bupe per day, that was about  years ago.  didn't sleep for ten days, but also was not in a place where i was expected to function.  it always starts with a skateboarding injury, then i'm within a week or two i'm back on.  catch- of skateboarding being, it's the only thing that brings me joy, really, yet it also precipitates using when i injure myself.  sorry, rambling.....just want someone to take my mind away from this shit for a bit.thanks"
"got hit with a skateboard can’t move so much pain they said they were gonna teach me a cool new skateboard trick and that i’d finally fit in with the youngsters i just wanted to expand my client base someone give me their phone number so i can tell you where i am and you can pick me up can’t say where i am on here friggin government always snooping in on my business also save my number i’m an attorney i charge a lot but trust me i need it for tortoise shells they’re really important to my uhreligion love, tadaka rad tad aka daddy tadplease help"
fucking propaganda corrupted all of you who believe his bs
"be conscientious about your own limits, educate yourself about the board’s limits and wear a helmet and pad and you will mitigate the vast majority of risk of accidents and injuries."
there is a difference between being strict and being abusive and having a toxic mindset. being strict means enforcing rules and instilling in your kid the importance of them. to get them to understand the importance- you teach them. you teach them why there are rules and why it's important to try to follow them to the best of your abilities. not blindly getting angry whenever your kid does something wrong.
"cutting the connection from the main circuit allows me to charge the fender battery separately, in case the batteries become unbalanced (happened to me once on a short run, i forgot to activate the external battery, resulting in draining only the stock battery. in that case each battery has to be topped up separately)"
"if you really, truly, actually want to save money by reloading, then do a thorough search for everything that you need, in your specific use-case, price it out, and then look for those specific items at yard sales, craig's list, etc, before dropping the big bux on new stuff. while you're pricing the equipment, look up reloading recipes to see which consumables are applicable to your needs, then search around to see the pricing for those too. after you've gotten that list of goodies and their prices, add it all up and compare that to the $ boxes you currently get."
"my uncle left his house on his electric skateboard and never returned. someone found him around : and called police. he was code blue when they got to the hospital but he was revived. if anyone saw anything his family encourages you to step forward. thanks for listening.update: he had injuries consistent with getting hit by a car, but he may have had a stroke and simply crashed no one knows for sure.  he's just now coming to a little bit. he's got strength on one side of his body and not a whole lot going on on the other side. he can't talk yet, and we don't know what he'll remember."
""" and "" wheels seem to be the standard. and while i've never rode an "" scooter, i feel like "" would be the bare minimum to deal with even the most modest cracks and uneven road surfaces. i get that there are practical considerations to how big of a wheel you can bolt onto a board. but there's a whole class of (mostly kids) push scooters using "" wheels, whereas i don't see them on any reputable electric scooters. maybe i missed them, or it's already been tried and abandoned. but it seems like a bigger wheel would be more stable and overall advantageous in nearly every way. i guess this is to say, the scooter i'm looking for doesn't seem to exist. ""ish wheels, smaller rim, bigger tire, dual suspension, lightly off-road capable."
they have a right to stop unconsensual use of their bodies and abortion is just that. abortion pill and vacuum aspiration do not kill fetus. they simply disconnect it from woman's body.
check out canicross or bikejoring. there are a lot more resources you can check out on those topics that can be relevant.
"hello everyone! welcome to the maxfind electric skateboard group, where you can share your rides and discussions to help make the community stronger! grateful!"
"it's interesting to read someone give an almost entirely honest explanation of ""the anti-car movement"" sprinkling in a few misrepresentations (eg: ""anti-car supporters also argue that making more space for cars creates induced demand..."" included demand is a thing and we've known about it long before cars became commonplace). and then go completely off the rails at the least possible second for no reason in particular."
"skating and punk rock absolutely saved me from a worse fate. i wish younger kids had the same people around them. skaters and punks were really supportive, non judgmental, and looked out for each other. that kind of positivity makes everyone better."
"i  am trying to decide between two electric scooters: apollo phantom v and kaabo mantis v/pro. i would really like to try each of them first. does anybody know any  shops/vendors in boston area that offer an option to try their scooters  and have apollo phantom and kaabo mantis in stock?there are plenty of bike shops around, but not so much for electric scooters."
"i'm  and / years post, m c/c. my cholesterol was out of control too, i started taking atorvastatin mg daily as prescribed by my physician and in about  months my cholesterol normalized."
"i don't have an e-bike or electric motorcycle/scooter yet, but the above seem to be some of the better options to me."
"i'm lying here in bed, unable to go to work due to a skateboard injury.  nothing fancy mind you, just getting a bit long in the tooth.  but i cant work, i get  sick days and i have no health insurance.it seems outrageous that seeing a doctor is out of the question, because i simply can't afford it.  i have thought about this for sometime.  the obvious counter argument is that competition and capitalism keep the medical field innovation marching forward. what does reddit think?"
"at a certain point there should be enough charge spread throughout the map that the system is self-sufficient, since every explosion leaves behind more charge in its wake. the only way she could truly run out is if errok goes out of his way to destroy them. in which case, she can just pop those puppies early to blast away his tools or projectiles, or simply smack his arm aside with a gentle yet powerfully firm frag shove. if he persists, she’ll punish him even further with more rocket punches!"
"i'm now waiting for an eloflex electric wheelchair that i can bring in my car and use while shopping or bring on vacations. i can still feel a bit selfconcious about it, but i'm working on it. i also have a great so who encourages me to use it. like my mum said; some need glasses to see, some need a wheelchair to get around. glasses are normalized, but so should a wheelchair."
"edit: while i do skateboard, and my mom did buy my son his first skateboard for christmas. and we will be spending time now that the weather is nice to learn how to skateboard. i was referring to ice skating. i work away and before this winter i had missed the  months of the last year of my four year old sons life while working.  so i built him a rink and enrolled him in skating lessons. and this has been probably the best winter of my life. watching my son learn a sport and have fun learning despite the crashes and the hard work that goes into learning something new, his resilience and positive attitude, is something i ll cherish for the rest of my life. the first thing he said to me this morning was “dad, i love skating with you”"
"the “rug” burn doesn’t make sense to me, especially the locations of the injury?? there’s to many spots. riding a scooter outside and knocking her face into the pavement sounds more convincing? but falling off that little couch @ such an impact?? soooo sus!"
the only way to achieve this without a software change is through a mechanical tilting of the gyroscope as it is currently not possible to accomplish this through software changes by the end user.
thank you for the video. here's some uncalled for musings about the subject:
"inga: i bet each one has its own exciting story, no?"
they knew that child can be sick yet they choose to breed. that should be enough. maybe they even had genetic condition and they knew that child had % chance of developing painful kidney failure.
"others moved quickly to adapt to the new circumstances. pique cancelled a scheduled tv appearance to promote the davis cup, one of his many outside business interests, which would have involved a day away in madrid while he was recovering from a calf injury."
"that's the problem you face by trying to run so much in parallel. build the basics, then add one feature, then test, then add another."
"if you're not consistently commuting with it, i think you'll be okay. but anytime you're on the road, you gotta drive defensively. doesnt matter if you're on a bike, or skateboard, or car. tgeres more risk on things like a bike for injury during a crash. the roads are a battlefield."
i got a paper cut reading a book! how can these publishing companies subject me to such danger?
"runs at mph and can do  miles on a full charge. not bad, i use it all the time! it's rated as one of the better lower-end devices and i have a brain injury so i wanted a model with less speed for safety."
"a good few months ago i had a skateboarding injury on my right thumb, unabling me to play the game for about  months, this broke me as i loved playing smash so much, i aint fully healed but enough to play smash without any pain, and ive just lost it, i used to dominate in this game once winning th out of  in a tournement, but now i just pick up the controller and i just feel like everything has went out the window, i just cant move like i used to, like i understand what i need to do to punish the opponent but i just miss and do the most dumb shit and honestly its making me depressed and making me want to quit the game in general. i feel im back at square one shouting at my screen where before i would just be more calm and think around it but considering i cant get my character to do what i want why bother. what do you guys reccomend? i dont want to give up this game but its pushing me towards that"

"i actually found that my baseline improved after i got a puppy because when she was young i was having to carry her downstairs once an hour to take her outside. i was exhausted at first, but walking m twice an hour actually built up my strength/fitness. i also found that getting a car (with a blue badge) increased my baseline a bit as rather than going on my scooter where i'd remain on the scooter, i could park right by a venue and walk that tiny amount. i'm not talking about levels of walking where i wouldn't need a scooter to do things i want to do, i use my scooter pretty much everyday. i just mean it's easy when first getting the scooter to lose a bit of your current level. i think for me it was somewhat worse at first because being in the scooter around others i felt this social pressure not to get up and walk around at points. because you look disabled on the scooter, everyone expects you to stand up and look frail. i don't look remotely frail when i walk around (unless i'm crashing or have gone over my limit), so i felt almost guilt for not looking that way which can make you bound to the scooter. now i've had my scooter about a year and a half and i do not care what others think, i am not bound to my scooter when i go out, it is a mobility aid, that is all."
"[~~timestamps~~]( guys, this is a bit different than what i normally post. i have my used boosted mini x electric skateboard for sale.~~~~i used it mainly pre-covid for college, but rarely use it anymore. it has about  miles on the odometer. never taken through wet weather. drive belts were replaced, but wheels and battery are factory.~~~~while it still runs great, there are a few small issues to note. first, there are some light to moderate scratches on the bottom of the board, including on the battery cover, trucks and motor caps. secondly, there is some rattling when going over bumps (this happened after i went over a large crack and i believe its because something is a bit loose).~~~~the board comes with the original charger, remote, remote charger and original box~~~~asking $ local to . i can ship but you will have to cover shipping (send zip for estimate).~~~~let me know if pricing is off or if you have any questions! thanks!~~sold local"
"broke my ankle (specifically my fibula) from a freak skateboarding accident at the beginning of may. my scar area is smooth and clean but the swelling around my ankle is still very apparent. according to my doctor, the bones look all healed but the ligaments aren't quite there yet, which is why i won't be able to walk on it until july st which is my next appointment. could this slower healing of ligaments explain why i still have some swelling around my ankle? and i also can't bend it as far back as my good foot, hoping that is normal. i'm not forcing it or anything, it's just part of the excercises he told me i should do every day whenever i temporarily take off the medical boot----update----i've been able to bear full weight as of  weeks ago which was a struggle at first but is much easier now with physical therapy! i'm feeling a lot better but it's not where it needs to be yet, i can't jog or run yet. i ordered an ankle brace to speed up the process and also protect my ankle further. was this a decent idea?"

"- heavier e-scooters are more powerful and have more range.  this is great for hills and to reach your home, office, and subway station faster.  the downside is that they are heavier, and not all subway stations have elevators or escalators.  so you may need to lug these heavy guys (about - lbs) up and down stairs each day for your commute."

"my mom felt much more comfortable once she realized the cms were good just asking her mobility to direct her and she didn't need to worry about judgment for her silly injury (it was silly in her case, poor mom was so embarrassed). since you have your own aids you use at home, maybe this isn't so much of a worry to you - but they know exactly how to accommodate guests and we never felt like we were inconveniencing anyone or anything. hardest part was finding where her scooter would get moved to after rides sometimes lol"
"to those who tried to assist me, i apologize. i was pissed at the asshole who cut me off, making a left turn into the gym without seeing me in mid-right-turn. i was also pissed at myself, knowing that braking in a turn is an automatic bam into the pavement. anger crowded out my gratitude. i appreciate that you were trying to help! as an aside, my knee was skinned up a bit, but i am otherwise just fine. again, thank you, kind people, for caring."
"[here is the video.]( : pm - i was just contacted by the lapd.  i sent them a link to the video and they will investigate and forward it to the parties involved.\]this happened earlier today (october  at about : pm).  i was across the street and looking at another direction, so i didn't see it.  i turned around to see it after i heard the sound.  i wasn't aware that my bike-cam (gopro) had caught it.  had i known, i would have given my info to the parties involved.  if you recognize the parties, please let them know of this video.  they are welcomed to contact me, although i can't offer anything more than what you see here (maybe a higher resolution version).lapd and lafd showed up to the scene.  the woman on the bird scooter complained of pain in her head.  i hope she is ok.  i have tried contacting the lapd central division, but all i could do was leave them a message.  i highly doubt they will contact me back or care about this video.  lafd offices are closed, i will try contacting them tomorrow, hoping they can get this video to the injured woman.it appears the woman was riding the bird scooter in the protected bike lane and the black nissan turned in front of her.  the nissan probably couldn't see the bird scooter because of the bus.  the nissan appears to be trying to beat the bus (which just started moving) and make a right in front of it in a rush.  that's my take from seeing the video."

"i've used the theater options in my car a ton. we take bikes up to the mountains, rent an rv space and then at the end of the night a little netflix or hbo is pretty neat using camp mode overnight. my kids use it the most though they're out in the garage with it almost every weekend. it was pretty awesome to have camp mode and ac in the garage overnight during a power outage and lose % of the battery."

"that’s absolutely false and you should never tell anyone that modifying a protective helmet does not increase risk for injury unless you want to accept responsibility for someone’s debilitating head injury or death. the article you linked is talking about attaching a camera or bluetooth audio device which is done with adhesive tape, not cutting holes in a helmet. the entire structural integrity of the helmet is ruined and useless for protection."
insurers absolutely will not pay out for something that should not be on the road.
"i think one thing we could do to help those understand urban mobility is that increased car traffic means nothing. yes cars get stuck, a blocked traffic light will cause lots of problems and a crash can block lots of cars for a while. but, all the forms of transportation we advocate for are not affected by cars or traffic jams."

"the first is in the infrastructure. german cities are much more walkable, and so small children can already navigate them by themselves, and don't need their parents to chauffeur them around everywhere. obviously this depends on where you live - but, to take one example, my daughter started walking to and from school with friends (no parents, except in the first few weeks) from age , at age  she could walk to and from school by herself (and therefore choose when to come home from school once her lessons for the day had ended), and by age  she was taking buses and trains by herself (within the local area). at age  they also do a ""cycling test"" (akin to a driver's license test, but for bicycles), and once they pass it, they're allowed to cycle to school. before that they will have cycled extensively all over the town with their parents, but at that point they can be trusted to cycle by themselves. all her friends live within a kilometer or two, and if she wants to go and see them, she grabs ker kick scooter and goes, as she's been doing since the start of elementary school. some of her activities are close enough that she can go there by herself, while others are further away and still need chauffeuring."

a couple was flying down my street and over the speed bump outside my window just now and they lost control and wiped out. of course they weren’t wearing their helmets. after a few minutes of her cursing him out they both got up and shook it off so they’re lucky that they weren’t hurt. if she hadn’t been wearing jeans she would have lost some skin with that slide. be careful out there and wear the freaking helmets guys.

"hello, so i had an idea for a diy electric longboard i wanted to build and i think you guys might be able to tell me if it's realistic. how hard would it be to add a v plug to the board? it occurred to me i'd be lugging around a kwh (hopefully) battery and most of the time i wouldn't use a quarter of that. i'm also constantly looking for unused plugs at my uni so why not plug in to my board. how much work and/or cost do you guys think this would add to my build? thanks."

"hi guys, i'm interested in getting an electric skateboard and can't decide which one to pick. i'm primarily interested in the mini-type boards that are super small compared to longboards and weigh around - pounds. i'd like the top speed to be around mph (i'm definitely too scared to go any faster on a tiny board). the terrain i'd be going on would mostly be paved roads or sidewalks, there's also i'd say around -% hill elevation where i live. at least a little waterproofing is a must since it does rain quite a lot in florida and i wouldn't want anything to break after going over a puddle on accident. also, my price range is around $. thanks in advance and hopefully i provided enough information"
"remember to rest…rest is the single most effective thing you can to speed up your learning cycle.  also, vary exercises.  don’t do mounting/dismounting for an entire session.  your brain will assimilate tasks faster if you vary the exercises per session (there’s research on this where the development of muscle memory is concerned).  spend no more than an hour per session and stop if you get exhausted.  your body needs time to consolidate all the new sensations and your muscles need time to recuperate.  as your brain builds those new pathways, you’ll find that the exercise you tried the day before that was impossible is a little less impossible today or in some cases, suddenly trivial."

"definitely, i deliberated about getting a scooter or electric wheelchair for years. i got a push wheelchair two years into my condition and while at first it was useful in getting me out and about, i found not being in control of movements made my fatigue worse. what stopped me from getting more equipment was cost, i knew it'd be useful for me, but it's expensive and i sat on the fence for a year and a half longer until i finally decided to not only get a scooter, but to apply for disability to pay for that and any other equipment i needed."
all of these have very pure “barca dna” — although the source who knows xavi denies that he will be too idealistic or purist in his philosophy.
"when i tell you, even as a cyclist, that i can't stand these things. they're silent, fast, rarely have lights, the riders don't wear helmets, have no regard for safety, and a total sense of entitlement on the road that puts us cyclists to shame. they just blast past you, cutting tight spaces between cars/medians, ugh the number of times i've had to stop because they tried to pass me or another cyclist in front of me, nearly gotten in an accident, and hopped off the scooter frantically, getting in the way even more."
"i'm going to be on the side of positive intent here. we don't know when the bottom could be. and we don't know how fast things will recover.  i'd like to thing what /u/maybesomaybenot is saying with ""be patient"" is ""manage your risk"". take a look at all the cash you have on hand, create a plan for what your average down strategy looks like, and then align your risk profile to the volatility in the market.  for example, if you had $k, and you feel like some of the companies you're looking at are still over valued, but they're at a more reasonable valuation (ie. lets say tsla). tsla is still at a p/s of  and p/e of . maybe you believe that this valuation is still high, but better than than the p/s of  and p/e of  it was at $. given that, could it fall another % to $? how do you think forecast will be? what is your guess on this? based on that, you can go in with whatever % of your free cash you feel comfortable."
the other day i saw a lurid headline about an e-scooter that had run over someones dog and killed it. obviously cars kill many more animals every year.

"i was in a scooter accident one hour ago i was totally at fault but luckily i have an insurence so that will cover it. the guy who hit me was a total asshole by the way, he was going on about money, how i was at fault. well for a thirteen year old it’s very scary and if you have an asshole blaring on about the money and how i’m wrong yeah that’s a lot for me. but luckily the people at administration were very nice to me and helped me not to worry so much. so tell me how you guys’ day were"
i get their concern tbh. roads are dangerous here afterall and my parents are the same. we've had a brain injury in the family due to a  wheeler accident hence their fears are valid.

wow.  has you running through actual sand for a very small portion, out onto a trail, and then up the cliffside.  consists of a bit more uphill and then a small descent underneath the ggb. i would’ve liked to run the uphill portion a bit easier, but any slower and i would’ve been walking. the th mile consisted of more catch-up and lead down into the presidio for a very flat mile .mile  was the only part i had never run, and coincidentally the hardest part. for some reason, i didn’t piece together “steep elevation change” and “lyon st” until i was looking at [the steps]( i didn’t know if there was a better route around it, so i went up the [first flight]( my enthusiasm and confidence disappeared as soon as i reached “the top” and saw [more]( my legs turned jelly, my heart rate felt sky high, and my breathing was pretty heavy, but i was back into familiar territory.the recent stairs made the downhill portion of miles  and  tough for my legs to feel solid. although at this point, i knew i was basically in the home stretch. the tail portion for  was a bit longer than . because i figured gps accuracy isn’t perfect.## post-racea short walk to cool down before heading home to grab a water bottle, my phone, and check-in with my girlfriend. i was thirsty and hungry at this point, having run without water or food. decided to go back out, and walk a bit/rehydrate while doing a post-run update call with my parents.i’m happy having finished close to my goal pace on a hilly route. i’d like to start incorporating some mid-run fueling and varied training runs. faster road racing has a  mpw base-building plan that i plan on using to up my weekly mileage. i'm thinking of following that up with alternating hm training and base building. my long-term goal for  is to run the honolulu marathon in under  hours. i’m hoping that  months should be enough to reach that.made with a new race report generator created by /u/herumph."
"edit: also in bikejoring the dog is not attached to you but in skateboarding you are running a huge risk also with a crash on to asphalt or into traffic, so super dangerous. canicross obviously the dog is attached to you but you are not on an unstable object going  miles per hour lol."

"you'll need a press and a set of dies. these might be found on craig's list (where i got mine) or at garage sales. also, those cl/garage sale finds often include dies and tooling, so they really are my go-to recommendation. you probably don't need a spoopy-doopy hornady lock-n-load auto progressive press with the -station turret, as a simple single-stage like an rcbs rock chucker can do the same thing, but... if you do find a good deal on a used, working progressive... well, go for it? it takes a little bit more time with a single-stage is all, but an upgrade is an upgrade, ya know? there's also the option of something like the ~$ lee classic ""press"" set which only requires a rubber mallet. i've heard good things and bad things about those though. depending on how you go about things, you might need a manual priming solution, or whichever parts are needed to fit whichever press you get."
yiu got this!👍
"there's an industry term for this (i'm in the industry), legal arbitrage. essentially it's using technology to escape a legal category so you can compete against established players without having to abide by the same rules. think airbnb and hotels, uber and taxis, scooters and bike shares, facebook and news, ghost kitchens versus restaurants, cryptocurrency and regulated securities, or the market i'm specifically in, electric micromobility vehicles that you only need a regular license to drive but legally operate like a motorcycle so you don't need things like airbags or expensive safety systems."

"and, if your problem is tailpipe pollution, welp. ice motorcycles are held to significantly less strict standards than cars for cost reasons, especially when smaller displacement (if you're under  cc, you can still meet the us standards with a carburetor, which hasn't been a thing in the us since ~, although european standards finally caught up to the late s for cars in ), and have horrific criteria pollutant emissions compared to cars. air quality is horrific in motorcycle-dominant areas, as a result.

"i never looked much into whether the lights on my scooter were legal.i knew that i wasnt a car and i was restricted to the footpath, so i didnt think logically i would be restricted by the same rules as cars.well, i did my research and by the definition of the law in qld:***""motor vehicle"" means a vehicle propelled by a motor that forms part of the vehicle, and—******(a) includes a trailer attached to the vehicle; but******(b) does not include a motorised scooter, a personal mobility device or a power-assisted bicycle.***section im refrencing: [transport operations (road use management) act  - schedule  ]( this distinction essentially means that because all the laws are new for mobility devices, there are essentially no restrictions on them in regards to colourful lights. a motor vehicle is heavily restricted when it comes to neon lights in qld. there are a lot of restrictions in what colours you can and cannot use on your motor vehicle but there is some breathing room, if your vehicle is not moving and is stationary then its fine for there to be colourful lights, it just cannot be moving. but since i am not considered a motor vehicle under the eyes of the law i am not restricted by same laws as cars, trucks, etc. this is based off of my research and was wondering if anybody could point at fault in my reasoning or would like to discuss in general about this topic?[ this is my current light setup on emove cruiser. as example to what i mean by colourful lights. ]("

could argue that the riders insurance is void but liability for the scooter and the scooters owner still stands.  the scooter is a commercial entity and must pay some form of compensation to government for use of public infrastructure like roads and footpaths. and it is a form of transport so maybe tac claim be explored.?either way these companies need to be held accountable for any injury and damage the scooter causes regardless.

"source:  we dive into our final twab of the season, we’d like to spend a moment focusing on an important message that our [black at bungie]( inclusion club published on tuesday. our hearts go out to the victims of the tragedy that occurred in buffalo, ny, last weekend, and anyone impacted by this act of violence.our full statement, and pledge that all profits from the “be heard” pin on the bungie store will be donated to the southern poverty law center for at least one year, can be found here: [ bungie statement on the terrorist attack in buffalo, ny ]( link]( week at bungie, guardian games is coming to a close, and we’re but days away from a new season.that’s right guardian games is nearing its end. warlocks are dominating as of this writing. will they hold on for their first guardian games victory? only time will tell. actually, not true—our social media channels will also tell. and you might be able to do the math by visiting the podium in the tower, as they might have such a commanding lead that titans and hunters couldn’t possibly catch up to their space magic. we’re just a few days out from a new season. we’ve covered quite a few systematic changes coming to destiny . sandbox changes, ritual reputation changes, and a few other details on how gameplay in general will be updated. many of you (and when i say many, i mean almost every single one of you) have been asking about the new stuff. what is season of [redacted] all about? what’s the next challenge our guardians are about to face? what’s going on with [redacted] and their [redacted]!? [where’s the trailer?!]( which subclass is getting the . treatment!?! there will be a day where many of your questions will be answered, but today is not that day. it’s a scary, but fun, balancing act in the grand scheme of things. i’ve said it before, but player discovery is one of the most potent things in gaming. do we spill the details in twabs and tweets, or do we hold things a bit closer to the chest with each season to let players dig in on day-one and find out some cool things in the game itself? if you’d like to go dark, this should be one of the last bungie communications you read before tuesday at  am pacific. if you’d like to get a quick taste before launch, tune in a bit earlier on tuesday morning and keep an eye out for a countdown for our next trailer. so, what will be our final twab before launch? we’ve got some details on how seasonal events will be evolving, a quick spoiler free patch note preview, a rundown on when our next dungeon is going live, and a preview of upcoming trials of osiris armor sets. keep an eye out for our player support section too, as we’ll be breaking down the timelines for destiny  update .. (which kicks off season of [redacted] on tuesday)! ***##destiny event updates once a season, guardians get the chance to take a break from our galaxy-saving duties to relax and reflect in special annual celebrations. these themed events—which include guardian games, solstice, festival of the lost, and the dawning—have become an integral part of the annual flow of destiny , where players can celebrate together and collect cool rewards along the way. over the past year, the team has been working hard on giving many of these events a makeover. this effort began with last year’s festival of the lost, which featured new twists like the monsters vs. dinos community poll and glint’s ghost stories. our goal is that every event provides joy and discovery for new and veteran players, and the enthusiastic reaction to the  festival of the lost reaffirmed our plans to keep evolving our events to keep them fresh and fun. while not every event will get a big update this year, we wanted to share a high-level look at our plans for the upcoming solstice event, which begins on july . **solstice. just solstice. **that’s right, we dropped the “of heroes” from the name of our summer event and are just going with “solstice.” while we’ve got a new name and will have some beautiful new floral arrangements adorning the tower during the event, those familiar with solstice events from the past should still feel right at home. as in previous years, there will be an awesome set of armor to pursue; only this time, instead of completing armor objectives and collecting keys and packages consumables, you’ll be completing event challenges (more on those in a bit) to make progress towards your ultimate glowing masterpiece of bodily protection.  one of the biggest changes you’ll notice with solstice is we’ve changed the armor experience a lot. players will only upgrade one set of solstice armor throughout the event. while you can get multiple instances of a helmet, for example, upgrading armor will allow you to reroll its stats and the stat potential of the armor will be shared across those drops.  another new feature coming to solstice is an activity in the european aerial zone called bonfire bash, where guardians will be building and stoking what can only be described as “paracausal bonfires” while the enemies of summer fun (including the taken, cabal, hive, and fallen) will be attempting to crash the party and extinguish the fires. in your mission to guard the flames from wave after wave of incoming enemies, we’ve made it easier to transverse the eaz, adding floating islands and removing building-barriers for maximum maneuverability. look for more details on solstice armor upgrades and bonfire bash as we get closer to the launch of solstice. **introducing the event card   **with our solstice event, we’re introducing a new feature called the event card. in much the same way that seasonal challenges introduces an easy-to-understand (and find) list of goals you can complete in a season, the event card does the same for destiny ’s annual events. when solstice begins, players will gain access to this event card which includes new points of interest to explore, including:  * event challenges   * event seals and titles   * unique event rewards   every event card will be available for free to all players and can be accessed by interacting with eva levante in the tower or via the quests tab (right next to seasonal challenges). event cards and their associated challenges and rewards can be accessed for the entire event before disappearing once their corresponding event ends.[image link]( take a look at some of the individual parts of the event card in order to better understand how they tie into events overall.  **event challenges  **like seasonal challenges, event challenges are objectives that players can complete to earn rewards. certain event challenges will award players with familiar items such as event shaders, emblems, or other gear, and they’ll also grant event tickets. every event challenge will be available for players to complete right when the event starts, so you won’t need to wait until the next week for additional challenges to become available. event challenges can be completed in any order and at any point while an event is active.  **event seals and titles  **in addition to event challenges, we’re also going to be introducing event seals and titles that you can earn. there are two types of event-based seals that players can work towards:  * individual event seals  * a new multi-event seal  starting with solstice this year, each destiny event will come with a seal that players can complete as well as gild. completing these event seals is as simple as completing all the event challenges on its event card. finishing every event challenge will automatically earn you seal progress and unlock the title for that seal. gilding event seals will require completing additional triumphs that will only become available once the standard seal has been completed—gilding lasts until the event begins again the following year. progress on individual event seals can be tracked directly in the event card by hovering over the card on the left-hand side of the screen or by viewing the event seal from the triumphs page.  there’s also a new multi-event seal that event-loving players will be able to work toward. starting with solstice, players can complete a certain number of event challenges in each of the four yearly destiny events to complete this seal. this means that the earliest players can complete the multi-event seal will be in guardian games of next year and doing so will also earn them a unique event title.  you’ll also be able to gild this new seal after completing the standard version and we’ll be sharing more details on how to do this in the coming year.  **upgraded event card rewards  **a new event means new event-themed cosmetics for guardians to customize their experience. while those items have traditionally been part of the eververse store, with the upcoming solstice event, we will curate a collection of these items as unique rewards through the event card itself. these rewards will only be available through the event card during their initial release but, like most of our cosmetics, there’s always a chance they’ll become available again via eververse at a future date.  while the event card and event challenge rewards are free for all players, acquiring these extra cosmetic rewards will require players to purchase the upgraded event card. upgrading the event card will cost  silver and immediately grants players an exotic reward bundle. players can then acquire even more rewards by spending the event tickets they collect from event challenges.  the overall value of the upgraded event card will vary somewhat but is expected to regularly exceed  silver. **description**|**type**|**instant unlock / event

complete the event, wait until the last week to make the purchase and see how many event tickets you have accumulated! but don’t wait until the very last minute because event tickets will expire once an event ends and the event card goes away. we can’t wait for everyone to jump in and experience all the new solstice changes we have in store. see you in july!  ***##another patch note preview while we’ve already gone over quite a few changes, ranging from ritual streak bonuses to a behemoth of a twab covering sandbox, we still have a few smaller patch notes to share with you before tuesday comes around. this will be a mash-up of fixes with no specific theme. it’s all just destiny , baby. **ux/ui *** updated the director navigation header to a new style to make it more scalable. * fixed a visual bug on the title screen when playing with a screen aspect ratio greater than :. * fixed a logic bug that would sometimes show inaccurate informational text on the bungie name change screen after a player had changed their name via bungie.net. * improved the consistency with which playstation and xbox platform rosters update the online status of platform friends. **dares of eternity *** increased strange coins earned from the reward chest in dares of eternity from  to . * this does not affect the number of strange coins earned from lightning round chests. **power and progression *** power bands have been increased for the new season:    * power floor:  (unchanged)    * soft cap:  (up from )    * powerful cap:  (up from )    * hard cap:  (up from ) * the character power boost has been increased to  with the new soft cap. **vault space *** vault space has been increased by  (was , is now ). * while we know this doesn’t enable players to save every single piece of loot in the game, the team was able to pull some strings and get a little more space for your vaults as they continue to investigate future solutions. **xûr** * xûr's inventory should no longer be different if players manage to find him at destinations shortly after the weekly reset happens on tuesday. * he will still reappear with new gifts from the nine when he returns at his regularly scheduled time on friday. * while his will is not his own, he needs a break each week—no more working overtime. **scorn *** *increased* scorn crossbow damage by %, ensuring players will always be one-shot by their attacks, no matter their power level or how many damage resist modifiers they have equipped.    * **don’t worry, that’s a joke. **   * had you there for a second, didn’t i?    * here’s the real patch note... * scorn sniper damage brought in line (reduced) with other combatant sniper weapons.    * spread of projectiles increased to reduce instances of multiple projectiles hitting players. ***##dungeon diving next week, we are launching a brand-new dungeon on friday, may  at  am pacific. the recommended power to enter for normal difficulty is going to be . master difficulty will be live day one as well, but we'll leave those entry requirements for you to see in the game next week.we’re going to let you discover where you will be going and what you will be doing for yourselves, but we wanted to give you a quick tease at what rewards you can expect to earn once inside. here is a high-level look at all of the rewards available from the dungeon next friday: *  legendary armor set per class   * artifice versions can also be acquired via master difficulty*  legendary new weapons *  legendary reprised weapons *  exotic weapon *  exotic catalyst *  exotic accessory (ship or sparrow) *  legendary emblems assuming you plan to brave the challenges that await you, these are the treasures you can claim. best way to get this dungeon as well as the one coming in season  is to have the digital deluxe edition of the witch queen. if you have that, you are already good to go! if you want to experience an entire year of destiny  content and haven’t purchased the deluxe edition yet, starting next tuesday, it’s going to be on sale for % off (exact timing and duration may vary by platform). if you just want the dungeons, totally fine, you can pick up both as part of the witch queen dungeon key in the eververse store for  silver. ***##trials, trials, trials this weekend, we have some fun lined up for trials of osiris. over the last two seasons, we’ve been experimenting with freelance and zone capture weekends, learning some great lessons about the trials ecosystem and population as it waxes and wanes over a given season. this weekend, we’re mixing things up just a little more with another freelance weekend, with zone control enabled. this will be your final weekend of trials for a while, as the mode will have a short hiatus through june . when trials comes back around, there will be some new loot to earn. while we’ve already announced that a fusion rifle and sidearm will be up for grabs, we’ll also have some new armor for your fashion game. we’re leaning deeper into the trials themes that you’ve seen over the years, and excited to see how you mix and match these new sets with pieces from activities throughout the game. [image link]( wait! there’s more! if you’d like to kit out your guardian a bit more with the trials theme, we have two new cosmetic rewards coming online next season. you may have already noticed the ghost in the armor preview above, but we also have this beauty to introduce...**falcon's chase sparrow (that i can't stop looking at. it will be mine. someday...)**[image link]( see you out there (and maybe even

"to put it in context you wouldn’t pay out for a drink driver who caused an accident with your car, this guy on his scooter is also breaking the law just by using it on a public road"
final step was the bms configuration and finding the right battery discharge protection while riding. it took me several rides and some readings but i think i got it right now.

"“cruyff’s philosophy is very good, but cruyff’s way of working might not work too well in today’s football,” says the source. “everything has changed a lot at the top level in the last  years. and these people are younger but they are very, very prepared and experienced, aware of what is going on at the top level outside — tactically, technically, technologically.”"
"if you're involved in an accident where you bear some or all of the blame, do you really want to spend your life paying, say, for the medical care of someone who was permanently disabled?"

"apologies if this is the wrong place to post, but this is something i've had on my mind for a while.ever since i was a child, i've been riding scooters of various kinds - kick scooters like the razor branded ones, and all manner of electric scooters.now, as an older man (+), recently, i've been tempted by the 'cool' factor of electric skateboards and have been browsing this sub in an attempt to find the best device for me.however, one thing i neglected to think about was any possible learning curve-associated issues i might have with switching from riding scooters to skateboards. one thing that i can immediately think of is that i'm used to maintaining balance on a scooter by manipulating the handle that protrudes upward from the deck; obviously a skateboard does not have that. would it be recommended that i learn how to ride a regular push skateboard first, or would it be all right to jump into using an electric skateboard? is there such a thing as a ""training wheels for new skateboarders who have been riding scooters""? or if there is a recommended electric skateboard that is suitable for ""noobs""? or, would it be difficult at my age to switch after having been a scooter rider for so long?thanks in advance!"
"hey folks, i'm visiting from r/onewheel, a sub for the onewheel electric skateboard. i ride the xr model ( as tire innovation is picking up for these fun devices, a thought occurred to me that serious tire-heads might enjoy considering: would this device present a good use case for an asymmetrical tire? note that i don't mean a tire with asymmetrical treads - i'm wondering about a tire whose contour is not the same on one side as the other. why?on a onewheel, you ride with one foot on either side of the wheel (one in front, one behind). both feet obviously point the same way. so ""left"" and ""right"" from the board and tire's perspective are ""heel-side"" and ""toe-side"". if you picture the rider, their weight will press more heel-side than toe-side. turns are achieved by shifting more weight toe-side or heel-side to tilt the whole system - so heel-side and toe-side turns are already slightly different. (also, foot fatigue happens.) would it make any sense in this system to use a tire whose greatest circumference were not centered, but slightly heel-side of centre?(note, for simplicity: i'm not asking whether these tires exist - they surely don't. and i'm leaving out all the personal preferences different riders might have as to tire shape.)"
"if you rent a scooter not from disney, highly consider hotels with a single bus stop as otherwise, someone just riding to the next stop will block you getting on. the best hotel on property for wheelchair users paying cash, in my mind is pop century. there is literally no carpet anywhere, you have the skyline where you have at most (besides after fireworks) a  minute wait for garunteed comfortable transit.  there is a single restaurant. the accessible rooms with the murphy bed are spacious with multiple turn around points and a built-in bench in the roll in shower. it is my top recommendation unless you are going deluxe."
a scooter has a lower center of gravity and tend to go a bit slower than an electric bike so i was thinking of getting one so i can get around easier.

"not only that but the lie she told to cover it up, a skateboard accident. i mean i was howling with laughter."
got in a car crash? sue toyota and ban cars!
"people dying because of police, general police brutality and harassment are also a topic here. most recently, a man named adil fleeing from an identity check on an electric scooter was pursued by not one, but two police cars. the second one ended up driving towards him at high speed and adil died in the crash. the crash itself could be ruled an accident, but it's clear that the situation shouldn't even have happened and as usual it reveals a bigger problem. men of moroccan origin are disproportionally the victims of police harassment and brutality."
ok but hitler isn’t worst than leleven
this i think is why motorbikes and bikes get in such bad crashes.

"but i was stupid. yes, if you are running a marathon every day, you really are putting yourself at risk for injury.  but you don't have to train that hard just to be in good shape. eventually i realized this and started a daily walking habit. it has been  years and i yet to injure myself (i did break my wrist last year, but that was from riding an electric scooter, not from exercising)."
"hii, i'm considering buying a onewheel gt or boost electric board and was wondering if anyone who rides/owns either could share why they chose one over the other. so far all ive heard is that onewheel is more fun to ride (many have compared it to snowboarding) but electric skateboards are faster. thankss"

"i've decided to make a post regarding safety as electric scooters are, as i have recently learned, quite dangerous.about a week ago i decided to take my nanrobot d for a ride around the neighborhood and going only -km/h cruising on sidewalks and roads, loads of fun. however, a sudden turn whilst going a bit too fast threw me off the scooter and onto the concrete where i skinned my knees up quite badly. even the long pants i was wearing were not enough protection as they were also ripped and torn up around the knee area. getting home, i had to clean the dirt out of the abrasions (very painful) and apply antibiotic ointment after stopping the bleeding and finally wrapping both knees up in gauze. as the injuries were so close to the joint, it had me limping for days and even stings a little to move right now. these road rash abrasions are no joke and if they're deep enough, wound exudation will ooze out and into the bandages, making it mandatory to change them daily -- a massive pain as most cotton dressings will stick to the wound, forcing you to painfully peel it off every time. luckily, special tegaderm hydrocolloid bandages are available for these types of wounds and are % worth the money if you suffer from road rash, i picked up a pack of  from the drug store for about -$ (a bit expensive) and it restored my mobility almost instantly, i cannot recommend them enough.i've learned my lesson the hard way and hope you won't have to suffer my pain, invest in some safety gear or at least take precautions where necessary because you will seriously regret not doing so when you do suffer an injury of these sorts, its not a question of ""if"" because it most likely will happen some day. **has anyone else had similar experiences? if so, how did it happen for you?**"
"are electric kick scooters legal to ride in sc roads and/or sidewalks? also, i looked into it, and apparently, electric scooters are outlawed in downtown greenville, but does this apply to other places in greenville besides downtown?&#xb;the electric kick scooter i have can go up to mph, so it can keep up with traffic.&#xb;["
"electric scooter [injuries]( are pretty inevitable and these scooters are aggressively moving into more and more cities.  the tech companies aren't going to stop pushing them everywhere they can possibly go, and if they have to spend money on education and lean on city officials to upgrade infrastructure, that is just the cost of doing business.  atrocious as it is to say, for bike riders, they may be the a big piece in getting cars to share the road in any sort of a real way."

"i will say overall getting a onewheel has been awesome and i don’t regret it at all. i’ve got some new parts coming in to change the color and i’m looking forward to learning how to ride better. it’s also exercise for me, which i’d been notoriously bad with in the past, so it’s even helping me in that regard. i found out i was completely out of the loop on gas prices recently because i just onewheel everywhere now. it’s been great lol."

"in pamy wife's abuela hosted easter dinner yesterday. in attendance was abuela's adult grandson, manuel. manuel brought his family including his young son miguel who in turn brought his easter gift: a new skateboard.after dinner miguel was showing off his skateboard by gently rolling back and forth in abuela's large living room. he was as slow and careful as one can be while riding a skateboard inside the house. i got up and moved to a different room from which i heard a crash. pablo, abuela's adult son, had decided to try out the skateboard. he fell off the skateboard, broke his fall with his hand, hurt his arm, and insisted his wife drive him to the hospital immediately. no one touched pablo while he stood on the skateboard or while he fell. from the waiting room pablo's wife sent a text to manuel that they might need his insurance. at the hospital the x-ray showed a fractured wrist that will, according to pablo, require surgery.i don't know if pablo was invited to try the skateboard, asked for permission to try the skateboard, or tried the skateboard without asking. abuela, manuel, and pablo all have health insurance and homeowners insurance.does manuel bare any liability for pablo hurting his wrist? does abuela bare any liability since it happened in her house? or will pablo's insurance handle % of the costs?edit: clarifying the injury and adjusting the tone of the question"

"you can ride a motorcycle in extreme weather, but there's issues. winter weather means a significant decrease in safety (unless you go to three-wheel motorcycles, which are bad for space utilization). rainy weather means you're getting wet (same is true of a bicycle, but not public transport). hot weather means that people will want to wear lighter garments, which means a significant decrease in safety. (and, safety garments increase the workload of getting ready to go somewhere, regardless of weather.) of course, in the asian countries that heavily use motorcycles to get around, atgatt (all the gear all the time) simply isn't practiced, it's basically a helmet and that's it. (but, then, in a lot of these countries, speeds tend to be fairly low...)"

here's the exceptions to the above list:
just yesterday - my office building management banned ebikes / electric scooters. the management is rockhill management. (i'm in nyc in midtown manhattan)  when i asked the front desk of the building management (who is not someone that has power) said it was because there was a fire(?) in another building and so management decided to ban them.   had to pay $ in a car garage to put for the day.. (more expensive than a roundtrip subway ride).  has anybody faced this in nyc or anywhere else? how can i fight this? i saw an article stating that buildings can't legally ban ebikes/electric scooters due to since people with disabilities may need them for mobility and would be a violation of human rights laws (however i haven't confirmed this myself). would a letter from a lawyer stating this scare them enough to change their stance? i don't think tbh there is a ton of people in my office that uses them (and not sure of other tenants).  this has been my main and only form of transportation to my office so i'm very frustrated at this situation.
"honestly i think this subreddit gets a little overwhelming at times with the whole protection thing. take for example druski's latest post here of him doing a top speed test and his buddy falling. there was over  comments of people criticizing his stance and gear. like, damn, we get it, they fucked up. but + comments? its a little much imo. say it once or twice, its fine. but at some point it gets a little annoying. druski isnt new to e-skate either, he knew very well the risks he was taking. we dont need to send him and his friend + comments explaining said risks."

"my  year old son has recently gotten heavily into skateboarding. he goes to a preschool where they skate and bmx every day. anyway, he begs me to take him to the skatepark all the time, and to do that i bought a skateboard so i could skate too. long story short, the past  trips i've managed to seriously injure myself each time. the last trip i fell off a ramp and hurt my wrist so bad i could barely move it for a week (yes i was wearing a wrist guard). i'm . i barely learned to skateboard when i was a kid. just enough to push, ride, barely ollie. so trying to get that back, and jumping right into a skatepark has been painful. on our last trip i saw a dude doing inline tricks and thought ""that's it!!"" i used to skate a lot when i was a teen...roller rinks with friends, roller hockey all the time. could skate fast, backward, t-stop, etc. i was pretty good. this was + years ago. my logic goes like: i couldn't skateboard that well as a kid so of course i'm hurting myself. i could blade really well, so it'll come back like riding a bike. so i put in an order for pair of roces m skates. i'm gonna attempt to take those to the park and learn some basic grinds, drop in, etc. while my son skateboards. hope it'll work out! i've been super inspired by some youtube aggressive vids. looks like a lot of fun.sorry for the rant....just kind of a self intro. i'll try to post about my progression. do you guys have any advice for somebody starting out who used to be able to skate, but has never done aggressive stuff (and is also  and fragile/slow!). thanks!"

"just wanted to let you know that. i also hit my head on the concrete but i think i’m ok, apparently my laptop took the bulk of the damage from the crash and fall. my laptop still turns on but it’s physically bent and doesn’t open all the way anymore. and i was already having a bad day, damn."
"after some distance, he saw a lady again, asking for a lift. but this time, he pretended to not see her and kept driving. he kinda increased his speed a bit to hurry home sooner. after some distance, something caught his peripheral vision. he turned his head on his side, to see the same woman running parallel beside him. she was looking straight in his eyes with a huge grin on her face. he was so shell shocked, he twisted his wrist, and went full acceleration at around  kmph. after some moments he went unconscious."
one of my friends was riding an e-scooter and got into a collision. she’s been in and out of a boot for over a year because of the damage the accident did to her foot. she’s had to have two surgeries so far and it still isn’t over. you couldn’t pay me to get on one of those.
"the only time bikes are involved in deaths or serious injuries is when they are getting hit by cars.  which, doesn't seem like it's cyclists making the roads more dangerous for everyone else.   bikes generally don't hit pedestrians, and even when they do, they don't result in the types of injuries you get from being hit by  pounds of metal."
difficulty level: getting past what you have predetermined the market should have to figure out how in the hell you are ever going to get there. do try to avoid completely screwing yourself (again). how to crash your startup is a terminal default mode.

"it cost me about $ between the (broken and crash damaged) bike, the gear to ride more safely, and the parts to fix said broken bike, but i'm saving $+ a week in gas and parking, so it does add up.  i'll break even by the end of summer, just in time to need to buy warmer winter gear.  that said, if i ride through winter, i'll save a few thousand dollars i would have spent on gas and parking, so the gear will pay for itself as well, and i actually enjoy my commute now.  it's just more fun on two wheels."

"big thank you to everyone who responded to this [post]( and gave their accident accounts. this post is a summary of those stories. the next step is to make a more robust and wide-reaching survey - the first of its kind for this industry. but we did get a lot of very rich data.we are talking about electric scooter safety during our [live show]( tuesday at :pm pst.  share your experience there and get tips from the community on how to stay safe.**cause of electric scooter crashes** of electric scooter crashes** by cause** of electric scooter crashes** by cause** simple summary is that most scooter accidents are caused by not knowing how to ride, not knowing the terrain, and getting suprised by other riders or vehicles.&#xb;the top two causes, **terrain** and **scooter issues** account for % of all crashes and % of all those are easily avoided.**terrain** falls are typically caused by  of  things:. hitting lips or raised portions of roads. going too fast and getting out of control, then hitting the side of a curb or lip of grass. sliding in wet or damp conditions. sliding over regular objects on solid tires% of the time these are areas you need to avoid and % of the time they could have been avoided. there are two main reasons for these types of accidents:. not seeing it due to excess speed, using phone while riding, and being distracted by cars or pedestrians.. seeing the terrain type, but not understanding the implications of going over a certain type of terrain in either wet conditions or with a solid tire scooter.to prevent the # cause, not seeing the terrain type, use these strategies. go slow when   . you are new to scooters   . you are new to an area   . conditions are wet or damp   . you have solid tires   . conditions in an area have changed (ex: construction zone). keep both hands on the scooter at all times   . do not use your phone   . don’t signal unless you are very sure of stability. learn your route slowly, taking care to memorize   . potholes   . lips over ”   . manhole covers or other metal objects   . uneven pavement   . loose sand, gravel, or leaves. after you’ve slowly memorized the terrain (% of scooter accidents), then you can start to look out for potential hazards due to vehicles (% of accidents), other scooters/bikers (% of accidents), and pedestrians (% of accidents)to prevent the # cause, not understanding the implications of going over a certain type of terrain in wet conditions with solid tires, follow use these strategies. in wet conditions slow down, especially on turns.. with a solid-tire scooter, know that you will easily slide on any smooth surface including manhole covers, hard plastic sidewalk intersections, road paint, leaves and account for that by reducing speed significantly.. with a solid-tires scooter avoid riding in wet conditions**scooter issues** (% of accidents) are caused by two things:. scooter malfunctions (% of category - not easily avoidable). user error (% of category - % avoidable)while scooter malfunctions are largely unavoidable, user error is % preventable.in order to avoid user error, use these strategies:. keep both hands on the handlebars (% of user error caused by phone use while riding). before riding, check that the stem and handlebars are fully secured, and locked in place. test each brake and make sure you can lock out the wheel. avoid hanging bags with hanging straps that can get caught up in the scooter wheels. don’t ride with drunk “passengers”. don’t use the front brake with more pressure than rear, make sure both brakes are tightened properlyunfortunately reported **vehicle collisions** (% of accidents) do not seem to be *easily* avoidable. every reported case of a vehicle-scooter collision resulted from the driver or passenger not seeing the scooter:. vehicle driver did not see the scooter (% of vehicle collisions). vehicle passenger not seeing the scooter ->  passenger door opens (%)the best advice to avoid these types of collisions is to assume the driver and passengers of vehicles do not see scooters. here are some tips to try and avoid vehicle collisions:. always keep enough distance from the rear and the side of vehicles and assume that   . every car is going to turn at every intersection whether they signal or not   . they could stop quickly at any moment   . they will turn into your lane and quickly cut you off. keep distance from cars pulled over as they may be ride-sharing vehicles and passenger doors may open any time. keep distance from cars parked on the side of the road as their doors may open at any time. when riding at night, use a powerful, high-mounted front and rear light as well as a safety vest. do not assume your scooter horn will be heard in loud trafficaccidents caused by **other riders** (bikes/scooters) and **pedestrians**, in total combined for % of all scooter accidents. unfortunately, % of these accidents were not easily avoidable. most involved the other party darting into the scooter’s path at the last moment. there were two reported cases of pedestrians or cyclists intentionally kicking scooter riders.here are some ways you can be extra cautious to avoid pedestrians or other cyclists/scooter collisions.. use your audible warning device when overtaking other riders or when. when turning in traffic, be careful taking your hands off the handlebars, look into getting a visible turn signaling device. be very wary of any rider going slowly as they may make a u-turn at any time without looking first. keep an eye on pedestrians and assume they may not see you comingif you have ridden long enough, you will eventually have an accident, and many are unavoidable. when you do crash protect yourself by:. wearing a helmet. you can fix most things through surgery, but not brain damage or death.. if riding at night, use additional front and rear lights + safety vest. if you ride fast, make sure to wear jacket, gloves and motorcycle rated helmet."
you can ride as safe as you want but there will always be that one idiot in a car ending your riding career. nearly every rider gets into an accident. saw a scooter on the highway the other day get rear ended and emts were trying to revive the guy.

it's not? lel. do a frame by frame analysis and compare it to irl footage of cars in a highway.
ps: some bike helmets are full helmets. full face bicycle helmets are a great option. i've also got a bunch of safety gear notes on a website here if you want to nerd out over this stuff.
can it go into classrooms? library? any reason why this wouldn't work as a mode of getting around campus?
"i looked online and several website reference the aap, and in particular a brief article published in *pediatrics* in . the article is attributed to a committee comprising maybe a dozen doctors. a brief search reveals a handful of other articles on skateboards and scooters; due to time constraints i picked just one other article to read, a  article in *research in sports medicine*.

(p. )i'm surprised by the bolded part; other activities requiring strength, balance, and coordinations, such as bicycling, are fine for toddlers, as far as i know. the recommendation that all children under  refrain from skateboarding cites 'retsky j, jaffe d, christoffel k. skateboarding injuries in children. a second wave. *am i dis child*. ;:–' (i did not follow up). it looks like, around the time of writing, most reported injuries were to the ankle, wrist, and face, and about one-third of those involved fractures or dislocations. among injuries involving hospitalization, % were caused by motor vehicles (p. ).the abstract for () says that many of the skateboard- and scooter-related injuries in children and adolescents ""can be avoided if children and youth do not ride in traffic, if proper protective gear is worn, and if, in the absence of close adult supervision, skateboards and scooters are not used by children younger than  and  years, respectively"" (p. ).***research in sports medicine***the abstract for () includes,>this paper reviews scientific literature on the features, outcomes and risk factors related to skateboarding injuries. findings suggest that while skateboarding injuries can be severe, skateboarding is not as dangerous as it might appear if appropriate risk management steps are taken. skateboarding should be encouraged as a worthy physical activity and local communities should consider providing specialised, supervised spaces for young people to practice this sport.

i think part of the problem is electric scooter and bike hire. when one group of road users show absolute disregard for road rules that will rub off on others.
"the second is educational philosophy. german children are taught from an early age to be self-reliant and responsible (age-appropriately, of course). the older they get the more responsibility and leeway they get - and the trust from their parents that they've taught their children well enough that they can sort out issues which arise without parental involvement. so a child in early primary school may well decide to head out onto the street or a neaby park to play with friends, shout this up to their parents upstairs, and then be out of the door. the parents don't worry - germany is so much safer than the us that the risk to the child is minimal, and being self-reliant is important for their development. there are always adults somewhere who will occasionally (metaphorically) raise their head and check if everything seems ok with the children playing nearby, but it doesn't necessarily have to be the parents, and most of the time the children are left to their own devices."
"one last thing on skate experience: i think skaters, especially hill-bombing longboarders, often weight the front of the the board for stability. if you have this instinct, you need to get rid of it asap on the onewheel, because it will lead to nosedives (overpowering the motor, tipping forward, feels like the motor abruptly cuts out.) you want to keep your weight over the axle, and only push a bit of shoulders and/or hips forward to tilt the board forward. some bend in the knees to absorb bumps and to allow body english in case you suddenly find yourself on a balance board."
still need some space for crash structure.
"i used to use the incase icon slim bag from a couple of years ago and although that bag served me well, there are a couple of issues that have presented throughout the time i've been using the bag such as not having a dedicated water pocket, not having shoe pocket etc. also i totalled the bag following a crash i had on my electric skateboard."

"some weeks i imagine a prison that i can break out of. kind of as a mental trick. like i tell myself i'm just stuck in some loop and i need to break out of it.&#xb;i mean, sometimes i do break out of it and find some relatively enduring happiness. then, i will make valuable progress in relationships, work and personal endeavors. but when my psyche is raw and i contextualize weeks, months and years of ""hamster-wheeling,"" i realize that that the prison metaphor is a delusion. then, i begin to question meaning. i realize i am just hopping from lillipad to lillipad without a strong string to connect them. &#xb;one week i'll decide to speak more, or listen more, or try to do certain things better at work. but the progress just keeps reversing itself and i never feel accomplished. in this regard, i can make sense of hours but i cannot make sense of days or weeks. so to the people around me, i am okay. during conversations, i am okay. i could probably convince you, the reader, that i am okay. but internally i know my compass is way off.&#xb;although i am making progress in life, i am worried. i've had + concussions in life. as a child, i was a soccer goalkeeper and didn't mind pain. i enjoyed diving into the ground. with serious concussions later on i began to realize something was wrong. a baseball to the head, a skateboard crash, staples in the head, two wrestling concussions and one football concussion. countless others from odd accounts and team sports. a scary record.&#xb;i'm split between a search for meaning and an acceptance of incompetence. the floaters, confusion, anxiety, diskenesia, ringing ears, hair falling out and exhaustion are my reminders of incompetence. small stress doesn't put me in bed anymore, it just confuses me. i end up like a shell-shocked soldier, looking around at the world without any sense of meaning. i guess i can live with this state. but deep down, i fear deterioration. i resolve weekly to put my mind to work and accept whatever life has in store for me. the emotions keep getting in the way. my simple decision making processes break down by around pm each day.&#xb;i'd love to hear any input here. i've built a complex prison for myself to endure a semi-regular life. deep down, i am struggling. i can pull the strings up from my marionette body to do work through force of will but my force of will is waning and i'm losing faith. my life is on repeat for years now.&#xb;last note. i think the biggest thing i've lost is a mirror. i used to have a habit where i would stop by a mirror a few times a day just to remind myself what i look like. but in social situations, i have no idea what's going on. i used to shake uncontrollably (from the chest) but luckily, i've gotten a handle on that. now, i have a strong voice in my head that tells me to listen when i need to listen, speak when i need to speak, etc. this is coming from a man who was a social boy. not popular, i just loved having friends. when i get by, it's all fine. but when i peer underneath the veil of reality to understand my life process comparatively against my former life, i really lose faith.&#xb;sorry for the pessimistic post. i am optimistic sometimes so i will post that soon. i would love to hear feedback, thoughts, connections, ideas, or really anything. feels like i'm underwater right now. i'm fine on a physical level but i'm psychologically defeated."

"i’ve been taking notes on stuff for a while now and decided to organize it all into one big timeline. none of this stuff is really *new* information, per se, and i've tagged this post as a theory because that's what it is and i don't want to give the impression that it's in any way definitive/official (it's really just me trying to fit all the puzzle pieces together). however, please understand that this post does *heavily* feature spoilers and such in all the stuff i reference. in addition to officially released content like the teasers, trailers, and stills, i also go over stuff like set photos/videos, audition tapes, and the rather spoiler-y monopoly game. please **do not** read this post if you aren't already familiar with that stuff or aren't okay with reading about spoilers. i cannot stress that enough.okay. so, it’s gonna be inevitable that some of my placement of stuff in the timeline will be off, but hopefully it all mostly makes sense. i’ll also inevitably have forgotten/missed some things with how much info there is out there, though i think i’ve at least covered the bulk of everything in this. also, i'm not % sure of the *exact* order of events in some places, so sometimes i just group stuff together that happens around the same time or that involves the same character(s).i tried to include links for most of the stuff i reference, though i didn’t bother with hyperlinking the teasers or trailers. also didn’t link the monopoly stuff every single time since that would be kinda tedious. [here’s]( a link to a video of the cards, and [here’s]( the board.last thing to note is that i don't really discuss the flashbacks for the creel house or hnl since this post is already long enough and i'm mainly focusing on present day stuff anyways.alright, here we go!# day **hawkins*** max meets with counselor kelley at some point during the school day.

(set photos [here]( and [here]( jason, patrick, andy, and potentially others watch on the news that an unidentified student was found dead at the trailer park (the word ""missing"" in the audition video is likely just a cover). andy jokes that maybe chrissy didn’t stand jason up after all (or maybe it could be about max and lucas?). patrick gets on his case and tells him to show some respect since someone is dead. ([andy audition tape]( \+ [patrick audition tape]( at some point later on (unsure which day this actually happens, just noting it down here for simplicity), jason talks to his buddies about what happened to chrissy (the cops wouldn’t even show her parents her face, so maybe something happened to her eyes?). the cops said chrissy went to eddie to buy drugs. jason blames him for her death and claims the hfc is satanist. lucas pushes back against that claim, but jason still disagrees and tells everyone to hunt eddie down.

([sullivan audition tape]( day **hawkins*** surprisingly little info on what happens during this day for the hawkins gang, so mainly just guesses here. doesn't seem like this can be the day of the first creel house visit, because then that creates weirdness with the timeline when comparing it with the california storyline and what we know happens in which episodes. judging by the outfit argyle is wearing in the still of him at surfer boy pizza, the california storyline is already on day  early on in episode , and the scene of max, lucas, steve, and dustin at the cemetery happens later on in episode . therefore, unless they're telling the storylines out of sync, the first creel house visit and the subsequent events that happen on that day probably occur during day . i guess we'll just have to see.* maybe chrissy’s funeral could happen on this day?* maybe we'll see stuff regarding fred?* there’s also a chance that nancy and robin’s library visit could happen on this day. currently have it listed for day , but there’s some weirdness with the outfits there so i could *maybe* see it happening here? robin would have to wear the same outfit (or something very similar) two days in a row though, so idk.**edit:** not that anyone will see this or that i’ll bother adding any other updates, but i’m just doing this one for my own peace of mind. it seems that most of the hawkins gang might actually wear the same outfits two days in a row, based on [the still of dustin, max, and steve at the school]( (in the counselor’s office, maybe?). so that, max seeing the clock there, nancy and robin at the library, and the pic of nancy and robin in the wheeler basement from the premiere are all probably day . the creel house, cemetery, and pennhurst are day . nancy changes outfits but not the others; sleepover at the wheeler house maybe? not safe for anyone to be alone with vecna out there tbh**california**el is apprehended by the police.* mike runs out into the street and looks on as the police van takes el away. el looks back sadly.

(trailer)* soldiers, four military vehicles, and a helicopter carrying a sniper arrive at the silo lab.  (teaser ); this sequence of events likely takes place in , given that the helicopter pilot and a nm based actor credited as a sniper (plus that actor’s stunt double) are listed for that episode on imdb. paul reiser (dr. owens) also has a stunt double listed for that ep.* mp guards and invading soldiers engage in a gunfight inside the silo lab.

([set video]( someone who looked an awful lot like a photo double (or potentially a stand-in? hard to tell at this distance) for el in her post-silo lab look was also spotted there, walking behind will in [this video]( el in the mindscape?* el (with a shaved head and wearing her floral outfit) is thrown back by some force in a spookily lit (mindscape?) version of what looks to maybe be the snow ball. (trailer)* this quote from the sfx magazine (pg. ) is probably relevant here: “we detour to hawkins middle snow ball ‘ - wait, isn’t this season set in ? - and we get to see multiple takes of sadie sink, sitting at a table below a giant disco ball. there’s a loud bang as a balloon pops behind her and she jumps up…”* el (again with her shaved head and white outfit) walks on a bridge over a skatepark. this likely takes place in , given how a skateboard stunt adviser is credited for that ep on imdb. given el’s outfit and when this takes place, it’s probably a max memory/mindscape thing.

"jackson was with a group of + people and they all decided to go to what we call “devils hill” from the skatepark. the hill is about / of a mile if not a mile from the skatepark and josh and i would only go down half of it because of it’s intimidation. colin went down first without incident and came back up. then jackson went next and wasn’t so lucky. jackson hit a speed of what seemed to be  mph before hitting a rock. he landed on his elbows, giving himself whiplash and slid about ft on the asphalt of the golf cart path before sliding off the path and to the side. i later there anywhere from  seconds to a minute before josh came down next, found him, and tried alerting the group. he started waving his hands and jumping, but the message he was trying to send was unclear to the group so he ran up to the top of devils hill and told them jackson was not ok and that the cops and his parents needed to be notified putting his senior year of high school on hold. colin made the calls and about  minutes later, the paramedics drove an ambulance down and loaded him into it to go to the soccer fields where the helicopter was waiting. joey and colin both got jackson’s chromatic glasses, wallet, car keys, and phone. when the ambulance drove him to the soccer fields, he was loaded inside the helicopter for a life flight. he was taken to the icu at grady hospital in georgia and was determined to have brain swelling, three hematoma’s, and a skull with / of it fractured. he was prepared for brain surgery to reduce the swelling, however one doctor suggested pumping his body with sodium. so the doctors did just that. the brain swelling went down and he avoided the brain surgery. he did however, have to stay in the icu for about  more days for rehydration. after that was complete, he went through rehab at the shepherd center in atlanta before being released into the world again. he was out of shepherd in  weeks and had his first speech, physical, and occupational therapy appointments a month from his release at shepherd. he went in for those appointments and they told him he had no reason to need it. he is still recovering but still has a long way to go with his cognitive recovery"
"had a long family history on my mother's side of serious clot problems, so i paid close attention which is a good thing. earlier this year i got a skateboarding injury (i was ) and then a few weeks later noticed a swollen leg after i had gotten home from my long commute. i went in the next day to get imaged and they found a clot. so fast forward through several months of doctors and testing, and then this past week i had my final doctor visit.awesome doctor, by the way. extremely technical and since i'm an engineer, i appreciated that. he said that my clot indicated very low risk risk factors. it was caused by something, it was in a minor vein, and it was in a distal location. he said he would not have even ordered the testing, although i think it was good that the testing was done because it confirmed that i have lupus anticoagulant. anyway he said that in addition to all of these factors, i have that family history. he said the lupus anticoagulant is not something that gets passed along, but he said that there are still several unknown genes that could tie me to my family history.interestingly enough he basically left it up to me on how i wanted to pursue treatment. so i told him that i wanted to be extremely conservative, because i have a low tolerance for death or embolisms and the damage and reduced capabilities that result from that. and i was willing to put up with some recreational changes and the bruising and bleeding that comes with blood thinners.so he said no problem, i just stay on xarelto for the rest of my life. he told me my primary goal was to avoid head injuries, or injuries that would lead to bad cuts. basically said i needed to adjust some of my recreational activities, so that means cutting back on the sports.  a bummer, but like i said i'm fine with being conservative. he also said it would help me a lot if i lost weight, which is fine because i'm  lb over my upper bmi limit which means i need to lose weight anyway. he did say that i don't need to worry about wearing compression socks, and i admit that despite being okay with being conservative i do freaking hate those things so that was very good news. and the final thing he said was that it is still good for me to break up long periods of being seated, whether it's on the plane or in the car at work, by walking around and doing a little bit of exercise. again, that's something that most people should do anyway.so that's my story, and i thought it might be interesting for others to read."
"you don’t need to crash in to anything - just get a little wobble off a bump, take a tumble and smash your head and you’re fucked. that never happens on a bike if you’re competent, whereas most people don’t have that competency on a scooter."
"when he woke up, it was around : a.m. or so, the sun was coming out, and there was a person who woke him up. he asked him if he was okay. the person told him that he found him laying on the footpath besides his scooter. he asked him whether he met with an accident or something. my friend's uncle looked around, and bite mark wounds on his thigh and calves. he had bled, but it was dry now (the blood had clotted already). he found scratches on his helmet, and some damage to the scooter."
but the actual accident itself wasn’t the worst part. it was bathing after. the day after the crash my mom had to bathe me (talk about humiliation). she had to actually scrub my road rash everywhere. i couldn’t use my left arm at all obviously but i also couldn’t use my right hand because my palm was mangled. i will never forget crying from pain butt ass naked on the shower floor with fresh wounds all over my body while my mother scrubs it all with a loofah and dial antibacterial hand soap.

"hi there, i would love to know which gears are a must have if you want to avoid injuries from potential scooter crashes. i also want to avoid having to spend  minutes putting on all sorts of gears prior to every trip... so what are some of the must must haves and must haves and nice to haves if wanting to minimize scooter crash induced injuries?"
also worth noting - the cms are great at accommodating this. my mom hurt her foot while we were there and had to rent a scooter for her with zero research done ahead of time.
"the estimated injury rate amounts to  injuries per  million e-scooter trips. by contrast, the national injury rates for other modes of transportation are  injuries per million motorcycle trips,  injuries per million bicycle trips,  injuries per million passenger car trips, and  injuries per million walking trips, according to a  study in the american journal of epidemiology."

i live on a tiny island (miles x miles) and i drive a scooter to and from work. had an electric bike for awhile now just peddle bikes my wife and i ride around town for dinner and such. i think a scooter is amazing. it’s the ahole tourist in cars that crash into scooters and bicycles all the time. causing serious damage or death.
"goes to that first question, is the risk of that harm reasonably foreseeable. then you would have to ask if the person did everything a reasonable person would do to mitigate that risk (helmet, pads, quiet spot etc). finally if having done those steps what is the reasonable likelihood of risk."
"i gotta say though, to your point - i have been considering getting a motorcycle. that joy that you can get from the sense of motion is something else. i really do feel it missing from my life, even though i know motorcycles are incredibly dangerous. i'm trying to think of something less dangerous that is just as convenient to do regularly and provides the same feeling, but haven't figured it out yet."
i don’t understand this argument. it’s no more dangerous than a snowboard or a skateboard or any number of sports and activities that come with inherent risks.

"i'd like to tell you the story of machat kerman, the first kerbal i ever successfully sent to the mun and back. although success in this case is very much determined by machat actually returning to kerbin.you see, machat very, very nearly ended up as a mun skeleton.&#xb;[machat kerman at the crash site of luna .]( picture shows machat at the landing site of luna  (left). the big, cylinder-shaped mess to the right of the image is the luna  orbit module. can you see the issue with an orbit module very much not in orbit?# phase : crash-landing on the munhere's what happened: all went swimmingly up until machat descended from mun orbit to the surface of the mun. this brave little kerbal forgot to retract his solar panels. minor issue with big consequences.as luna  gently (spoiler alert: it wasn't very gentle at all) touched down on the slippery slope of one of mun's craters, a solar panel clipped the ground. not only did it break into a million pieces, it also sent luna  tumbling down the slope into the crater, shattering the second array in the process.not to worry, thought machat, and quickly powered up his engine again, stabilizing his descent into the crater. he elegantly fired himself back into the not-air, then descended again and landed somewhat smoothly.only then did he realize that slowly running out of electricity was now the smaller of his problems.# phase : we need to crash again!luna  was not equipped with an awful lot of spare delta v to beginn with. the little hop to counter his crater crash crisis left machat with insufficient fuel to return anywhere near his unmanned orbiter. whoops.as soon as he realized this, machat panicked. so did mission control back at the kerbal space center. only a few brave souls kept their cool and started thinking.if the lander can't get back to the orbit module, the orbit module must go to the lander!so mission control takes, well, control of the om, points it retrograde and de-orbits the thing. so far, so good. unfortunately, it's an orbiter, not a lander, so it lacks some basic landing features, like legs.no prizes for guessing what happens next. correct! while the no-longer-orbit-module touches down gently, it then topples over like a drunk guy in a bar fight. now there's an almost fuel-less lander sitting some  metres away from a rolled-over de-orbited orbiter in a crater on the mun.# phase : ""machat, you have a problem""the next issue for machat kerman is the following: the orbit module does not have a crew capsule. the upper stage of the lander is necessary for kerbin return. these two were supposed to be connected in orbit above mun.docking is slightly more difficult when you're stuck on the ground.with its last remaining fuel, machat flies the lander over to the stricken orbit module. he detaches the crew capsule, then it's time to get his hands dirty: by eva-bumping into the detached crew capsule, he rolls it over to the om far enough to dock the two together. yay!that only leaves one small issue (for now): how the kerbhell do you get back to space from here?# phase : it's not a moon, it's a halfpipe!the good thing about a crater is this: if you look at it from the other end, it becomes a sick space skateboarding ramp!so machat does what any sane kerbal would do in his shoes: using his rcs thrusters, he orients luna , now consisting of the crew capsule and the om, back up the hill.then, ever so gently, he uses the om engine to glide/scrape/grind his way up the crater. as he would have found out in a parallel dimension only prevented from existing by quicksaving, the maximum speed allowed in this scenario is roughly  m/s. good to know.after half an hour of slowly accelerating, then cutting the engines, then repeating, luna  finally reaches the edge of the crater. this turns out to be just enough of a ramp to get a little bit of not-air time, and at last luna  takes to the skies again.# phase : back to kerbin, maybe, with a bit of luckas luna  accelerates to establish a very, very low mun orbit, the final problem arises: the entire process of de-orbiting and re-orbiting an orbiter never designed to become a lander has used more delta v than was available.in other words, while machat can escape mun and return to a kerbin orbit, he can't get close enough to land.while our brave little kerbal settles into his high kerbin orbit, the calculations back at the ksc don't look to promising. even abusing the inverse oberth effect of retrograde burns precisely at the apoapsis, machat's periapsis does not go lower than  km – more than  km away from a possible aerobrake maneuver.for now, machat is truly, madly, deeply stuck in space, with little hope of ever returning to kerbin.# phase : mun, to the rescue!but after several orbits and short, quick retrograde burns, an opportunity arises: precisely at the apoapsis of his journey, machat has another mun encounter!calculators are fired up back at the ksc, and the numbers add up: by expending his remaining delta v, machat can propel himself to a mun encounter that will lower his periapsis to... , km above kerbin.an atmospheric periapsis.no time to waste, just fuel to burn! machat completes his maneuver and uses mun's gravity to fling himself back into a new orbit. and indeed! as he slowly approaches kerbin's blue spectre in the vastness of space, he feels the gentle tug of atmospheric resistance on the surface of luna .now, the final challenge is to actually survive reentry.his first aerobrake is too high and too fast to actually come back home. at a height of more than  km, machat shoots through thin air at more than  m/s. but crucially, his periapsis is now within the atmosphere, and every pass scrapes off a bit of his velocity.on the fourth aerobrake pass, the engineers at mission control see what they were hoping for: enough speed and height are lost to make sure machat does not escape kerbin's atmosphere again.after  days in space, in the early morning hours, machat kerman touches down on kerbin.and he's never, never ever going back up there again."
"i have a  honda pcx scooter, it’s dirt cheap and reliable, been riding it for  years ever since highschool. on the flip side it’s just not fun riding it anymore, it has low power (obviously), no abs so locking brakes is a thing and after my crash  months ago it’s even more noticeable, it’s bruised up completely. the worst thing probably for me are the tiny tiny wheels, front tire is probably as big as was my electric bicycle wheels and it’s annoying in corners and when you got debris on the road which makes it harder to ride. edit: to add, suspension is nonexistent now try doing deliveries in this junk for  hours without messing your back."
"hey guys,i started muay thai about  weeks ago. i train almost every day (i've taken the weekends off so far), for two classes in a row, so a total of  hours. i feel like it's not worth dragging my ass down there, changing, training for only an hour, then showering, yet remaining a sweaty mess for the rest of the day, so that's why i do  classes in a row.i have an old skateboarding injury from over  years ago. i broke my wrist, it healed, maybe not perfectly. at anytime, i can twist my left wrist in a counter-clockwise motion and it will make light snapping noises (like cracking a knuckle) which usually freaks out people around me. this wrist occasionally gives me trouble, if i put a lot of weight on it (push-ups, missionary sex, etc...) so i had a feeling it might become a problem in muay thai.needless to say, today after holding pads for a very experienced fighter, i really felt some pain in my left wrist. it only continued after we switched and i hit the pads for the next  minutes. it doesn't really hurt during a jab, but usually only during a hook or uppercut. i think i am throwing the punches correctly, but my trainer said he would pay close attention to it tomorrow, after i brought it to his attention. i realize that i've never really thrown a punch before starting muay thai, so obviously there are going to be some growing pains. however, i know my wrist well enough to know that a problem would eventually be coming. soooo... what do you think i should do here? keep going, perfect my technique, and hope it feels better? maybe just work on my technique and not worry about throwing hard punches? take a break? (really don't want to do this), or some other option? please note i don't have health insurance. any help is appreciated!"

"riding my bike on the sea wall near davie and marinaside this evening when a guy riding a scooter wiped out hard in front of me. he didn’t lose consciousness, but he had really bad facial and head wounds (wasn’t wearing a helmet unfortunately). he also informed me that he had a history of head injuries and that he was dizzy. i called an ambulance - told them he had a pretty bad head injury, but that he was conscious. they told me to ensure that he stays seated and to call them back if he loses consciousness. they assure me that an ambulance would be coming shortly. we proceed to wait . hours (during which time the dispatch called us back multiple times to check in). after . hours, i’m worried that his wounds might get infected unless he gets cleaned up (they were looking quite gnarly), so we make the decision to walk to st. paul’s together. we make it there, he get’s looked after, all good. i get that the ambulances were likely occupied with more serious cases (covid, overdoses etc), and that vancouver on a friday is busy, but man, it was so defeating waiting there for so long while this dude’s face was full of blood and he was in a lot of pain. not sure what the right answer is here - he was fine in the end, but it’s a little disheartening that i had to walk this guy who had just suffered a serious head injury to the hospital. wish things were different, hoping in other more dire circumstances that an ambulance would at the very least, show up. do we need more ambulances? more medics? maybe? i don’t know, but tonight the system felt broken."

"hey guys! so i recently got this electric skateboard from a dude who was selling them for like  bucks a piece there very similar to the mototec ones you see on amazon for  but he sends them out with lithium batteries and only one w motor which is plenty as is. anyways i got a larger ah v sp battery for it (been using a sp) i just took it down our / mile long driveway and back (mostly sand so it didn't love the ride) and on my way back it cut out and i figured i'd just carry it back since i've had bad luck restarting the battery from cutting out in the past. well, when i was dragging it back i noticed the wheel was super hard to turn. i got back threw it on the charger right away noticed it still had % (i have a battery gauge) and just left it charging until full charge. when it was fully charged i even let it sit for a bit and then i powered it up everything seemed to work fine the first time i powered it up after all this it kicked on the relay but when i hit the trigger it would cut out and the battery would shut down it didn't even move the wheel without a load on it.after this i tried my sp battery and now the relay wont budge. i went to take a look and noticed the board was shorting out the motor somehow which is why it was hard to turn. so i'm not really sure what went bad, i did nothing wrong as far as i'm aware but now i just need to know how to fix it. the board its self seems impossible to find i will send some pictures and maybe someone can lead me in the correct direction i might just get a completely different driver board i don't like the controller it came with anyways and if i just get the same driver its probably going to fail again. but if its cheap then i will look into it. tl:dr motor driver/esc dead need new one where to find please help. board]("
"you know what happens in my country if you hit someone with a modified or illegal e-bike? you get charged as if it were any other un-registered road vehicle you hit them with. you could have been going km an hour when you hit them, but if it’s proven that your bike or scooter goes faster than the legal kmh under-power, you’re up the creek. in  albert dean may was leaving a shopfront and was struck by an illegal e-bike going under km. he later died from his injury and the rider was appropriately jailed, his crime, not following simple laws. now that’s real life."

"because of my endometriosis i have pelvic pain, uterus pain, sciatica pain, lower back pain, arms and legs aching, severe bloating, exhaustion, urgency to urinate all day and night, diarrhoea, and nausea. i had a laparoscopy to diagnose and remove the endo, though it began to present again two years later as it began to grow back. when i woke up from the procedure i  had horrible pain from the gas they used settling  in my shoulders; it was actually terrifying to wake up to. i also got a post-op blood infection a few days later and was rushed to the hospital to get alot of antibiotics injected. i did manage to get pregnant at  despite the endo and had a great birth except that my placenta was retained because of endo tissue attaching the placenta to my uterus wall. i lost . litres of blood that day and almost died. i had to have a blood transfusion before they could put me to sleep in order to go in and get the placenta out to stop the haemorrhaging.  also, i have had diarrhoea since then. i had another coil put in  months after birth because i had symptoms coming back. i was awake, again. this time was even more painful. my body went into a state of shock and my uterus contracted all day and into the night. just barbaric. was better though, than waiting for surgery with all my endo symptoms coming back. on top of this, my knees have been dislocating on the regular since i was  (i’m thirty now) and i’m certain that my nerves are crushed  and the cartilage is worn down. i get aching all through my legs constantly and sharp pain in my knees. furthermore, for the last  years i’ve noticed this one spot on the right side of my mid/upper spine that hurts. it’s like really sharp but also aching pain. it feels like a fireball in that spot. one time my friend was massaging me casually and she noticed that spot was a bit swollen. it’s progressively gotten worse over the five years and now i’m noticing a lot of other concerning symptoms. the muscle all down the right spine has been chronically spasming. all day, every day. laying on the shakti mat feels like my muscle is alive because i can feel it squirming (contracting) up and down my back. the pain is spreading from this one spot on my spine into my right shoulder, right side of my neck, right arm arm and right leg. i have muscle weakness and fatigue in the arm and leg too. it’s just all aching all day every day. the og pain spot in my spine is sharp, hot and constant. the skin on that area is numb to the touch which is weird. it also often feels itchy. everything feels connected to that spot. now the back of my right rib is in agony i can’t even breath in fully without sharp pain there and mid spine. it feels like there is so much tension and pressure in the right hand side of my body. i’ve recently been wondering about why i get a recurring large ulcer on the right side of my tongue and always in the exact same spot. like  times last year. my right eye is always painful and itchy. is there something wrong with the right side of my body?? i also haven’t had a solid shit in almost two years. the sciatic pain in my right ass has been intense lately also. oh yeah and my feet are sore and stiff every single morning. my theories have been that.  i have a crushed nerve in my spine because of an old skateboarding injury from like  years ago. . that i have endometriosis growing in that spot on my spine. . arthritis of some kind. my doctor is amazing in trying to help me figure out what’s wrong. i recently went to him and presented him with all of my symptoms and he has ordered two sets of extensive blood tests trying to see what it might be. so far it’s all come back normal except for slightly high cholesterol lmao. while i’m glad i don’t have any of the nasty stuff he tested for, it feels frustrating to not have a diagnosis. he has recently referred me to get a bone scan with nuclear medicine done which is next week. i’m really looking forward to seeing what comes up in that scan. apparently it can pick up a lot, including infection. since i went to the doc a couple months ago, my pain has gotten much worse and the weakness in my arm and leg is making it difficult to hold my baby and generally do what i need to during the day. my doc recently prescribed norflex for my spasm which was no doubt causing a lot of the pain and pressure. it really helped to relax my muscles and it felt so relieving at first but then all of these other newish pains came up under where those muscles are. like new sharp rib and spine pains. also my right forearm feels like the muscle is being ripped or something when i stretch or extend it out even slightly. what the shit guys. i’m sick of being in all kind of pain for my whole life. i’m just sick of it. also i can’t be on norflex long term it makes me feel high, i need to parent. i usually make myself cannabis infused coconut oil and take pregabalin.thank you for getting it this far in my venting session. i just feel like a broken record with this stuff to those closest to me, so i’m giving it to the internet abyss."

"i mean... yes? if you crash into someone while driving a bike, electric scooter or rollerblades chances are you are going to hurt yourself just as bad as anyone else, even a pedestrian. i'm not saying that suddenly everybody is extremely cautious but don't you actually think pretty much everything else than a car is indeed less dangerous than a car? an accident with a car, even going slowly, can paralyze you or worst while the driver will at worst get their car wrecked but they will be fine. so again, i'm not arguing that everybody on non car are particularly pleasant but in term of actual danger i disagree."

i know hed be happy with anything in terms of a budget price point but i know very little about what would be worth it to an avid skater but newbie electric board owner. i have done some research.this seems to keep coming up as best budget longboard . wowgo  – $. wowgo s max – $. meepo v shuffle – $and shortboards. meepo mini  – $. verreal mini – $does this seem to make sense? as someone with zero knowledge. he has a short board now he likes so i was thinking i should go for that but idk if there are considerations with the e boards. feel free to toasty ignorance just tryna make my man smile and we've been in a tough financial situation. wanna find the best option so i don't waste what could have been an even flyer giftif you got thru this ty any advice or if you have qs shoot x

"i've given them a bunch of free fixes (such as the independent chargers creating ""bird nests"" on private property, essentially leasing space and doing a revshare or a partnership with local businesses through swiftmile (which already has the freaking docking station ready to go) similar to the volta model with whole foods). they could fix their legal problems at like zero cost but the idea of it taking non-zero effort makes them not care because all they see are the arbitrage opportunities. it's pretty gross. they take great solutions and recklessly transform them into new problems."

a full face is not overkill because on an electric scooter you are higher off the ground than a bike. you also tend to crash forward due to the smaller wheels and other geometry and more likely to need chin protection. but many choose to take the extra risk and only wear a bike helmet. this is a personal decision but i recommend the full face if you are willing to wear one. your scooter is right on the line so do whatever is in line with your personal risk level.

"hill decent is amazing with the electric brake.  again, going downhill on the l on these steep routes were a no-go.  its speed would quickly blow past the stopping ability of the rear-only brake, almost ensuring a crash.  some places i could creep down on the brake at walking speed but often i had to dismount for safety.  only medium hills were within the electric hill-decent envelope, but when you pull the brake lever, this regen turned off leaving you way past the point where the rear tire would lock up and fail to slow the scooter.  other times i overheated the motor going downhill causing the same situation.  my brakes needed continuous replacement, maybe + sets of pads in the past year.  the apollo is perfectly controlled, i can even let my speed increase above mph on a steep hill, then reign it right in with the electric brake."

"i was thinking just this morning the cops need to step up and stop ignoring the electric scooter mayhem. i was riding in prospect park before the sun was up, it was light out but early. and an electric scoot guy going maybe - was riding the wrong way mid lane just after you get squeezed for the exit below the great hill. we do the “who’s going to go left/right dance” and eventually i just stop because he headlight is blinding me and i can’t see where he is looking. we didn’t crash bc i stopped and went around him. i ask him what he’s thinking and he really wants to talk about it, following me towards the rink. mostly shouting that i should mind my own business.  i’ll admit this issue being one of my largest a pet peeves with living in nyc (the nypd being the biggest) being told to “mind my own business” when someone has just threatened my life and made it my business blows my mind. he chases me and keep threatening me, i try to draw him to where we can discuss this with a cop. he says he doesn’t care about cops but won’t go talk to one to see who is in the wrong. i don’t like involving them, but he was not leaving me alone and he could out run me on the scooter thing."

i had to see a different emergency sports doctor who (eventually) found out it was an emergent issue. couldn’t walk even with crutches for two months before mri came back (scooter bound/ broke a toe during that time due to miscalculation) i then got surgery within ten days of my mri coming back to that doctor.

"my biking experience is limited.  i'm a commuter, not terribly interested in it as a hobby, and with zero interest in it as a sport.  during covid i started biking to work on my old college mongoose gravel bike.  for those of you who don't know, the mongoose was the highest quality bike that you could buy *in target.*  anyways, a combination of potholes, sidewalk cracks, and  crashes killed that bike.  after that, i used my deceased father's bike.  it was a lighter, higher quality road bike (some  year old $ schwinn).  i hated everything about it.  it was did not like driving through grass, it had some stupid crotchless seat that my dad installed (literally two butt pads), and the breaks randomly started firing (once on the biggest hill in town).  anyways, that lasted until a very nice father of two toddlers hit me at an intersection and dragged it  feet.  he drove me home and paid for the bike.so, i got the kbo ranger.  the kbo ranger is basically a cargo ship, but in bike form.  it weighs in at a petite  pounds pre-add-ons.  when riding it at pedal-assist , it goes from a leisurely  miles an hour to a thrilling  miles an hour.  the tires are so fat i'm pretty sure they're actually from a  toyota camry.  its welding scars and agility make it look like frankenstein's monster.  it has the turning radius of a shipping container.  the back seat so low to the ground that an adult has to sit in a vertical fetal position on a flat plank of skateboard plywood.  its idea of suspension is, ""i wonder what your butt will feel next?""so, why did i get it?a.  i'm fat and it has a weight capacity of lbs.  i couldn't find another e-bike that could fit me, my wife, and our pet goat (sheneneh).b.  i'm poor an it was $ dollars complete with mirrors, bell, basket, pedestrian package, front headlights, taillights, motorcycle kickstand, and rain covers.  it's feature comparable with a radwagon, which was the only other serious competitor to me.c.  biking up one hill on the greenway to work really sucked.how do i feel about it?  it's great.  i can go to work in  degree heat, and only work up a mild sweat.  i feel much safer, because i can throttle through intersections.  i'm still exercising, but that exercise has been levelled out.  i don't go fast down steep hills only to slam on the breaks at the bottom when they intersect the road.  i don't slow to a crawl on the ugly hills.  it is a commuter bike, not a piece of sporting equipment,  that means i'm probably going to end up taking it every day."

"-  i've been eyeing the glion dolly .  it is a less stylish and slower than the unagi, but it is about the same weight.  both the glion and unagi are basically the lightest e-scooters on the market that aren't kids toys (both around  lbs).  its main advantage is that it is built for transit and small apartments/offices.  it can fold up and stand upright by itself, and it has a dolly wheel & handle combination that allows it to be towed (at least on smoother surfaces).  the drawback is that it's not always available (probably due to pandemic supply problems from china), and it has increased in price significantly since i first checked it out ($ now vs about $- before)."
any electric scooters around? what’s the experience like in brighton & hove?have you been stopped by the police yet?i’m curious as them being illegal doesn’t make much sense right now and considering the cost of petrol…

late night phone conversations with good friends.
"yes, the centre of gravity might be lower but overall i find the position on the vehicle much less secure. you're standing on a very narrow platform, the handlebars don't take any of your weight and the wheels are rather small... i felt that if there was like a pine cone or a small rock that got in front of the wheel, i would go flying over the handlebars and break my neck. my position in those kinds of situations is a lot more secure on my bike. and vulnerability in crashes involving cars is probably about the same. so i will definitely stick to bikes."
"what was your first scooter crash like? how did it happen and what the speed were you going? i just had mine on my d+ 😳👌not too long ago at night. you see those traffic lanes that all of the sudden mix with the pavement, yep that happened to me, by the time i realized i was fvcked, i was heading straight o the pavement at mph in dual mode. always wear ppe. fortunately, i was using it at night when there's less traffic and less pedestrians. drive safe, don't be like me. ✌️😳"
"parts for the fender cover. each piece would take between  -  hours to print. i would then attach them with screws, holes being thought of before printing. i printed using some sort of polycarbonate filament to have an impact resistant material in case of a crash.

"yes to parking and a lot of other things... like recently i went to a doctor's office for appointment only to find the nearest handicapped parking was way on the other side of the building... i had to call them and ask a nurse to come out with a wheelchair since i couldn't walk that far. literally,, there were at least a dozen non-handicapped parking spots closer to the door,,, but no curb cut so i could not use them. at least here there are some stores that will provide (free) an electric scooter with large basket so i can drive around the store and shop... and they will come to my car and bring it to me."
"great comment. i hadn't focused on the mechanism of injury, but it sounds like the scooter tried to pass the bus to the left, and slammed straight into the backing-out suv which was in a blind spot created by the stopped bus.  this is clearly the scooter rider's fault for proceeding at a high rate of speed though a blind spot.  and as you point out, the stopped bus was a clue that it was yielding to cross traffic."

"f. i have been longboarding for almost  years and i love it! a week and a half ago i got an electric skateboard/longboard and iove it!!!! it’s so fun! i thought it would be more difficult to ride but it’s actually much easier! i never use the brakes when i’m on the board but when i jump off i use the brakes to stop the board from rolling forward. i still push off and get going before i use the power but idk why it just feels more comfortable! it’s a good amount higher up than my old one that isn’t electric. i thought that would make it harder but it actually feels a lot easier! i’m so happy! i’ve been riding it down a canyon nearby almost every day! also started riding it to and from campus. i’m grateful for all the comments and advice i got when i was deciding if i should get one, i’m so glad i did!"

"please let me preface this with: i'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. i've bee following /r/fitness for about  months now, and i'm undecided whether this would qualify or not, but i know you guys would be able to offer me advice. if you'd prefer i post this elsewhere please let me know and i will.my dilemma: i’m  years old, ’”, -lbs. about  years ago, i was around lbs. i was very active, i skateboarded and longboarded frequently, walked everywhere, etc. i then had a very serious skateboarding injury that caused my physical activity level to plummet for months, and in turn i gained a lot of weight. about two years ago, i reached lbs and decided it was time for a change. i completely changed my eating habits. i now eat only white meat or fish. i eat vegetables with every single meal. if i eat bread it is always whole grain. i counted calories religiously for about  months until i got a solid idea of how much i should be eating (approx. ). i stopped drinking any juice or soft drinks and now only drink water exclusively. i also joined a gym about a year ago, and i got myself a personal trainer to give me that extra motivation, and i see her twice a week on top of going to the gym another  days a week. i started snowboarding in the winter, and skateboarding again as well as playing tennis in the summer, and have also recently taken up kickboxing. but here’s the thing i don’t understand: after changing my habits to even better than they were before, my weight dropped within weeks to - lb but it hasn't budged since then. i feel like no matter how hard i try, how much exercise i do, or how close i watch my calories, i’m still stuck in the - range. what makes it even more frustrating is that i am losing inches. my jeans are slowly getting baggier, i’m slowly dropping holes in my belts, my tops are fitting somewhat looser, but that number just will not change. why is this? what am i doing wrong? i'm starting to feel very frustrated and helpless with this. any help is greatly appreciated. thank you. td;dr - cannot seem lose weight no matter how hard i try, and i don't understand why."
"so i'm sure you guys get these similar stories about hardship, credit cards, and loans. i am not here for pity or for a lecture about how horrible i am with money. i just have a handful of questions that are too specific to find answers without calling some places or asking here. thanks.sorry this ended up being very long, you can skip to the end for my question if your actually interested in giving me some advice, which i greatly appreciate! so..... i'm not great with money, i make bad decisions. i buy expensive audio and recording equipment that i probably shouldn't own. i wasn't in debt but i had myself set up for disaster. i have a $ car payment, $ rent, another $ between phone and insurance, at least another $ in misc subscriptions and bills from sweetwater, and about  months ago i decided to finance a new martin d, that's about $ a month. i make about .k a month after taxes, so i was already stretched thin but i always pay all of my bills and keep my  credit cards paid off.in august i had gotten back into skateboarding after a few year hiatus, i'm . it was a great way to exercise for me. then one day just cruising i managed to fuck up really bad, i fell and somehow shattered my pelvis and broke my acetabulum, i had to get a major surgery and they had to basically screw me back together, yay! its now nov, i still cant walk, but am lucky that i'm am essential to the operation of the business i work for so as soon as it happened my boss gave me a couple hundred bucks and let me do some work from home but it was only bringing in about $ a month, not good. i went back to work after about a month and a half. i'm now making a lot less because i'm not able to work as much. i'm making about  a month now but that will slowly change back to what i was making. during the time i wasn't able to work i had to use all of my available credit to pay my bills, luckily i have a wonderful fiance who paid for all of my food and whatnot, but i still racked up about k in cc debt, now its very difficult for me to catch up, all of my ccs are maxed and late. my bank account is negative all the time and i'm barley managing my car payment which i've prioritized as well as my insurance and phone. my credit score dropped from close to  to around  in that short time. im also becoming a burden to my wonderful fiance who has already had to basically wipe my ass for a few months, i hate that, but am lucky to have her. luckily my k in medical bills was completely wiped out through a charity type financial assistance program, thank god! not having insurance really worked out in this scenario. i'm extremely grateful for how this turned out honestly with the medical bills and my poor financial decisions i should be in a much much worse position. i completely understand that and am not trying to make anyone feel sorry for me in any way i feel extremely lucky. i honestly feel guilty that i have people who care and so many things went right at a time when so many people are so less fortunate. so, all three of my cards are stupid high interest +% apr, the minimum payments plus interest is too much for me to handle right now. after a few months of getting paid i can get back to being ok but its going to take me selling some gear and eating cheap, i already have listed a few expensive items on reverb. i was looking into consolidating, the options on kreditkarma are a fucking joke, my credit score being so low is probably the reason. the options are all like % % apr and my car as collateral, i don't know who would actually fall for that. my question, finally, sorry, is....... is there a better place i could go and say get a k lower interest loan with my car as collateral, i would assume putting my car up would drop the interest down to a reasonable -%, is that ignorant of me? i know nothing about finances, obviously. also, if that is a possibility, do you think it would be a good idea considering my circumstances? i just hate paying hundreds of dollars to these companies for basically nothing. in an ideal situation i could get a k loan with low interest and pay it off in a year or two and avoid all of these damn interest charges every month, they are really crippling my progress.  i also do not want to have to sell my beloved guitars and gear but i am willing to do that if necessary, i just would lose a lot and end up never being able to replace the guitars, the two i have were k+ back before all of the online taxes and wood importing fees. in todays market they would be closer to k but it would take me years to sell them at a similar price., which i don't want to do, they are my favorite things in the world. also, i tried returning the d that i bought a month before my accident and they were not having it because in my crippled state i accidentally knocked a heavy item into it cosmetically damaging it, it was a bad fucking month. thanks for anyone who actually read this and is helping me figure out what to do, no matter what i know ill be fine, i just don't want to make any more poor decisions that lead me to a place where i'm actually fucked, thanks!"

"i sold my car in  due to economic hardship caused by the crash. since then i’ve used bikes, trains and the odd bus.  years ago i bought something you might consider: a piaggio mp. scooter with  wheels at the front. can be ridden on a car licence. much cheaper to run than a car. the cc and cc are plenty powerful for open country roads. they’re much more stable than  wheels and are literally twist the throttle and go. a good option if you only use a car occasionally. not sure how feasible given the uk climate. also you need protective clothing even on a scooter but nothing like the leather outfits motorbike enthusiasts wear. it might be an option for the warmer months when you want to go further afield to places otherwise inaccessible on public transport. they re much quicker than a car because you can zip past lines if stationery traffic. you also don’t have issues with parking. with the amount of speed cameras on uk roads they’re not so scary to ride because the rest of the traffic has to keep to a sensible speed. you do need to be a confident rider and know how to drive defensively. other thing is you have much better visibility than when you’re in a car i mean you can see more what’s going on. finally i actually don’t think you can function as a properly independent adult without your own transport. i also find myself increasingly intolerant of the anti social behaviour of other passengers - listening / watching content on their phones without headphones, turning the area around them into their office, man spreading, lack of awareness of boundaries, clogging up space with electric scooters, body odour…"

"similarly, playgrounds are explicitly designed so that children can test their limits at their own pace. they aren't sanitised and ""child-proofed"" to avoid even the slightest risk of injury. instead, they start small, and encourage the child to see what they feel comfortable with - without parents holding their hand, preferably - and then progress to be ever more ""challenging"" (and therefore ""interesting""). if they fall, they'll scrape their knee, but it's nothing serious, it teaches them what their limits are, and encourages them to push those limits at their own pace. i went to a german indoor playground with a british friend last year, and she couldn't believe we would let children near such a thing - all she knew where the ""soft-play areas"" in the uk, where every surface is covered in soft foam, whereas the german version was all wood and substantial height differences."

"it should be noted that if you have never skateboarded before, you should know that you wont be traveling around campus effectively for a few weeks if not a few months. going fast in a straight line is one thing, but being able to control your board through the chaos that are purdue bike lanes, that takes a while to learn. even if you have skateboarded before, you often need to teach yourself how to do it with a backpack on since the extra weight does take some getting used to. be prepared to crash a lot, its bound to happen."

"i was curious about the history of self-balancing electric skateboards, after seeing the onewheel prototype mentioned in the recent [luis rossman - josh haley interview]( and a commenter here noting an english device from , so here's what a quick search has thrown up.  if anyone can fill some blanks around the history of trotter/mag, floatwheel and funwheels i'd appreciate it, as some of the newer devices are actually harder to get times on, as info is buried in social media sites and i've only just started [floating on]( this year ;)    ===    ben smither, lotus software engineer, th march  prototype:      description:  ""a balancing scooter using a go-kart wheel, a  watt v dc motor, an osmc and a pic microcontroller.  a simple pid control at  hz balances the assembly.""    links to a page showing the internals:      ""i've put together this page to document a one-wheeled balancing scooter / skateboard that i've just finished.  it's the culmination of several iterations over the last few years, and definitely my favourite.    it's very similar to a snowboard to ride, requiring no user input other than the movement of your body mass.  leaning forwards and backwards controls the velocity and moving your weight from heal to toe controls the turn radius.""    mentioned in [engadget, th march ](     seems to have a lot of the features of current devices, main difference is the motor is outside and drives the wheel with a belt.  like the difference between belt eskates and hub motors.       ===    john dingley's project, another prototype th jan :      description:  ""finished version of a one wheeled self balancing skateboard i have been working on for the past year""    also mentioned in [engadget, nd jan ](    has a website with lots of really interesting info about self balancing unicycles, segeway, and single/double wheeled skateboards, including numerous build pics:      build page shows metal side rails, go kart tyre, various electronics, wooden deck:   another interesting above thing is the ""[twin wheeler rebuilt jan ]( has a side carry handle shown, and flat packed cells under the deck.    also has a lecture about self-balancing things.  absolutely fascinating and goes over how some of the fundamentals work, then into the future with self-balancing motorcycles, wheelchairs, etc:      ===    future motion produce ""[onewheel]( .  kickstarter / shown th jan .  various follow-up revisions/models.  generally considered to have refined the concept and implementation.    ===    [trotter magwheel]( late  is the earliest mention i could find.  company listed and some posts in google history.    model shown ces th jan  briefly, until future motion got us authorities to [shut their booth]( over alleged patent violations.    the case was later dropped, with [an interesting quote]( reported: ""it's suggested that the company mislead the courts about the strength of its patents, tricking authorities into taking out a legitimate rival."".     seems to still be operating, providing more budget options for a complete product.       ===    funwheel th jan ?  not sure on the history of [fungineers]( or the funwheel, but believe the original people are still active in the broader community, promoting open source and diy builds.     ===    floatwheel th jun  prototype?  a single person project which expanded into selling pre-made parts to easily diy builds.  a bit more lego a+b+c than the more freeform diy process.  around th nov  scaled things back after a cease & desist sent from future motion, and now [floatwheel]( seems to be limited online sales only.    ===    social media / discord / reddit from the s has a lot of diy info sharing.  working on vesc based projects, with self-built and small-company produced battery packs, controllers and so on, ordering parts direct from supplies and online retailers.  the comparative availability to d print allows bespoke constructions far easier than the previous need to machine or cnc parts.  i personally found stuff for a diy build, setting up vesc, motor configuration, and general theory really useful from youtube channels by: freedomcaller; surfdado; mario cortino; esk builders just to mention a few, plus all the discussion and help on other platforms.    it'll be really interesting to see where things go, but seeing the the evolution of where we came from is fascinating."

"i'm incredibly worried and it makes me sick to my stomach. there's always been something *off* about her. for instance, whether it was within a crowd of friends or an intimate conversation, she would disassociate *often.* you'd say something to her and she'd be looking right at you, sometimes even smiling, but yet, she'd be somewhere else, her eyes behind a soundproof window of glass. not to mention, her emotional processing was completely out of whack. she would cheat on people and then laugh about it. she would get drunk and grab men's dicks right in front of their girlfriends. thing is, when you'd talk to her about it, she'd shove it off completely. ""i don't see what the big deal is! (giggle)"" but, it'd be the most non malicious response ever...almost innocent, like she *really* didn't understand what the big deal was. those are just a couple examples for some background.now for the part that really worries me:she recently went on a trip (about a month ago now) for a week, where she did some acid (that thursday) that she found through this random guy on the beach. when she came back (sunday), her behavior was profoundly concerning. i've done my fair share of l, as have most of my friends, and were all in agreement that post-trip reactions never last more than *maybe* a day (sometimes mild hallucinations when smoking for - days) and they're never extreme. my friend was acting as if she was still tripping, just stuck in this loop of the same circle of stories for the entire time i was with her. spirit babies, significant numbers, spirit husband, the fragility of consciousness, death of past lives/future lives--all at the same time...i asked, ""how long has it been since you slept?"" -- "" days."" (later i found out this was a lie. she hadn't slept for eight)that day was the last time i saw her. i began to worry when she didn't answer her phone for  days. i don't know, i just had a bad feeling. i began to dig and found out that she had been admitted into the psych ward. she had been to the doctor the previous day for a skateboarding injury and when she woke up, she told her roommate that she was really concerned that the people at the hospital were trying to steal her identity because they were saying her name too loud. she was there for a week. now she's gone. i don't know where she is. her phone has been off for a month now. i call her everyday, just to check. god. fuck. i don't know what to do or who to talk to or where to scream. i want to know if she's okay but i'm afraid of the answer. i don't know anymore..."
"i really don’t know. i have thought he was guilty for a long time, but i was on scene recently to a terrible accident involving a head injury. a teen neighbor took a bad fall off an electric skateboard. he was unconscious but his body still kept rising up and trying to get up…it was the craziest thing and i had to keep forcibly holding him to prevent him from smashing his head repeatedly into the road. so when i watched the scene where kathleen falls in the stairwell, i was instantly taken back to the way his body reacted to the trauma and found it more believable than i did previously that she could have injured herself even more when she was semi-unconscious or unconscious and alone."
heres a clip of the tricks  i'm talking about: [
"before the update: recently i've been noticing that as time been progressing i have lost many friends due to many factors in life (i guess we all just grew apart over time) and now i skate alone. must admit quite of an introvert but lately a goal of mine was to film some skate videos, video making has a been a passion of mines here's hoping someone in charlotte north carolina wants to skate me and make some videos for funthe update: its has been a while glad to see so many new skaters in the community, i'm fully healed from my skateboard injury and proud to say that for the first time i have gone to a skate park and i was scared mentally but it was quite fun. unfortunately going to skate parks is something that only happens few time a month due to travel reasons (i don't own a vehicle)"
"that feeling is also shared by xavi. “xavi is the most excited of everyone,” a source who knows him well tells the athletic. “this is a dream he has been working towards for a long time. he is very convinced that everything will go well — he and his staff.”"
"“look, i promise i won’t use it for anything sinister,” i said and smiled at the at&t lady."
"you do realise legality /=/ safety? you seem to think that a law is passed in parliament and something becomes inherently safer because of it. bicycles, scooters, and the like, are all only as safe as you make them. how does one riding a scooter in a bike lane, as the same manner as every other  wheeled road user, suddenly created some huge risk which children and the elderly are now doomed?"
"calisthenics is the opposite of machines. its much harder to isolate, but we build real world, practical strength, applicable to our feats. we are almost always building groups, rather than muscles. also the associated tendons, ligaments, joints, etc. we are far less prone to injury. the caveat is we are totally responsible to enforce good form. it is a skill...much like form needed to play guitar riffs, or to do skateboard tricks."
"there's a lot of intersections that have a stop sign, and those are usually in places where there were accidents in the past. some of them have perfectly good visibility, but some people just don't see a car coming at them. they certainly won't see a cyclist. this is important, because it is the cyclist that is protected by having them give way to cars."
i asked him to drop some onion rings. he said what i said i need rings down now. he looks me dead in the eye and says don't disrespect me like that. i laughed and said huh? i'm telling you to do your job. he slammed a bunch of around being a child about it.

"street skating like today mostly wasn't a thing or a new thing in the very late s that didn't overtake vert at most, so often times for casual skaters it was just a transportation tool along with very minor to no street skate tricks and to some extent just a few things in the ramps, parks or bowls where most of the sport was practiced."

(ice, naproxen, raised). i have pain that radiates from the right side below the knee and down the calf. almost like if im constantly stretching it. ever since i was a child if i cupped my knees they would both have a soft popping feel and soft clicks. the injured knee no longer does this.-looking for a second opinion.-how long will it be before i can board again?

"electric scooters are everywhere in nz. mostly it's fine, businessmen getting from the train station to the office etc, but especially in the evening or at night it's teenagers riding around super fast. saw a few scooter accidents while i was there. no one wears helmets with rented scooters and half the time they don't slow down to cross roads. so i saw  teens nearly hit by a car at a crossroads, an old lady knocked down and attended to by an ambulance (the person riding the scooter had fucked off by then), and  scooters crash into each other. i was almost knocked down on several occasions."
chuck d was a punk in attitude and old school underground hip hop was relatable to street punks and skaters who were hassled by cops the same way black people got hassled.
this is another reason for this sub. reducing the number of pissed off drivers in traffic makes riding a motorcycle safer too. my only crash was when a taxi pulled out in front of me.
personally i distinguish the two by assigning chaotic things to the adhd and ordered things to the autism. i often feel pulled in both directions. i need and like schedules and routines and knowing what's going to happen ahead of time. i also feel trapped out caged by all those things and crave novelty.

"and what else can one expect? julie’s half-hearted seduction of olivier before skipping town is the most understandable one after the death of a spouse has ever felt like, because this so feels done out of desperation and instability rather than cunning design. binoche plays it perfectly, you cannot possibly get mad at it; afterwards she self-harms by dragging her knuckles across a stone wall and both of these scenes are such heartbreaking grabs at trying to feel something, anything, whether it’s pleasure or pain. neither seems to work. what eventually makes julie snap out of it and rejoin the world, is realizing she’s clinging to a false memory, at least in terms of her husband. the movie doesn’t really have any solutions to what happens when a truly charmed existence as julie seemed to have is suddenly ripped away, but when you lived a lie as julie had with the presence of another woman in her husband’s life, letting go of the past is only sensical. in an odd way this awful truth seemed to set her free of her grief. the one mercy her husband afforded her, intentional or not."

"***""what are you? you're a cop?""***    [*”really? you seriously think i’m a cop? cop in a skin-tight red and blue suit?”*]( richard parker and curtis connors worked at oscorp, specializing in the fusion of human and animal dna to advance medicine and humanity’s abilities. however, on learning of how his work could be used as bioweapons, richard fled with his wife, leaving his son with his aunt and uncle, only to be killed in a plane crash. years later, peter parker discovered his father’s link with connors, and in researching it ended up being bitten by one of oscorp’s spidered modified with richard’s dna. the mix of the two gave peter spider-like abilities, such as increased physicals and an ability to sense oncoming danger. using these, as well as a suit and gear created with his incredible scientific mind, peter became spider-man, using the great responsibility he gained with his great powers to help the citizens of new york. ***#legend**** - the amazing spider-man**** - the

"i have some questions for any electric micromobility that make all of them not worth unless you are a delivery driver or solely for use for last mile commute. i currently use my  dollar budget normal bike when i want to, but it's rare because trying to go anywhere i want to go will end up in me being extremely sweaty and tired by the time i'm there.it seems like there's three main classes of electric vehicles:**ebikes** have the benefit of having good control and being able to use without charge easily, but the thing turning me away from them are that it's very bulky and heavy, and storage is a big issue. it seems like the cheapest used ebikes are  > dollars, and leaving them locked out in the street for any period of time is anxiety inducing because of theft, especially since having a battery is a big ""steal me!"" sign. what do people use ebikes regularly do to mitigate theft? i know to never leave a bike overnight, but it seems like it would be gone within the hour. i know some take the battery with them when they leave, but lugging around a giant heavy battery i feel defeats the convenience of an ebike in the first place.&#xb;**eskateboards** seem like the best in the portability aspect, and is very easily stashed, but it seems like a death trap, especially in streets that aren't in manhattan. one pothole and it seems like at best i'm walking away with a permanent injury especially with the drivers in the city. how practical is getting a skateboard in nyc? i want to get one so i can use it on my college campus after summer, but i don't want to spend upwards of  dollars *just* for the school year when it's not snowing.&#xb;**escooters** seem like a compromise of the two. it seems less stable than a bike, more stable than a skateboard, more portable than a bike and less portable than a skateboard. it also doesn't seem like something you could carry with you if you need to walk for a bit, like hopping into a store to browse or something. but the only problem it really solves is being able to stash it under your desk; you can't exactly bring it around with you when you're walking around.&#xb;i want to join in with evs because they seem convenient and a much better alternative to car (going to queens to brooklyn by train is awful) and would cut my commute to work by half because of the last mile problem. but outside of commute, i can't think of the benefits of an ev in nyc! what are your guys' opinions on them? if you have them, what are your true use cases like?"

"hi this is my first post i apologize if i'm doing it incorrectly. i will be attending sdcc this year and i have pots. postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. basically my heart races all the time and although i'm on meds to help, when i over do it or stand or walk for long periods of time, my heart rate gets hella high and my blood pressure drops and i get lightheaded and can faint. i want to rent an electronic mobility scooter, because it's easier than a wheelchair, to take with me to the con. it would be delivered to my hotel there, but i know that those little stand up scooters are banned so i don't know if taking and using the rented sitting down medical condition kind will be ok. i think i know where to go to get an ada sticker and that process. although i'm still not sure if i should take a drs note. but also i'm so nervous about hall h. just in general it will be my first time trying to do hall h, but with a scooter and ada, my anxiety is through the roof. like, i'm so stressed about where to go and if i will get my scooter taken away or if it will even be allowed. any advice?? 🥺"

"i got in an accident on my moped/scooter last week. guy was stated at fault for running a red light. i hit his car with my scooter than i *think* i had a little ride on his windshield before landing on pavement. i've gotten really ""lucky"" with my injuries with no broken bones or internal injuries. a lot of deep bruising, muscle strains, bruised ribs, whiplash, etc. some missed work and difficulty with movnig and daily tasks. recommendations were to get with a lawyer but it  appears standard agreement is they will be taking % of whatever settlement."
i ride an electric unicycle and am no risk to anyone. my wheel cost me almost £ grand and i am not about to have it break from some stupid crash in a pedestrian area where i could hit cars and stuff.
every crash i've had on the onewheel was user error. i was being a dumbass and the board let me know it.
"lift your light higher off the deck of the skateboard.  mount it on a stiff coil spring so that in case of a crash, rider is not impaled, light remains reusable."
"you don't have to walk everywhere! i have a mobility scooter that allows me to travel up to  miles, and it goes slows enough that i can avoid injury"
"a person or motor vehicle matches the description of a suspect or suspect vehicle in a murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, armed robbery, kidnapping, forcible sex offense, a felony committed against a child, or any other felony where the risk of death or lifethreatening injuries is imminent if the suspect is not immediately apprehended."
i agree that tsla is overpriced but they are already down % from like  weeks ago. that might have been the correction.
"like my other comment said, i checked multiple posts over on r/ skateboarding and all the comments were encouraging and about the hobby itself or skill being shown. its socially acceptable to not wear a helmet when you're skateboarding, but nobody makes fun of you for wearing one. and you arent looked down on for choosing to wear or not to wear one. i believe in risk assessment and injury mitigation. that is all subjective to the rider's skill and their risk tolerance. the pros getting paid millions of dollars do it, the teens at the skatepark do it"
"it was somewhere between ncsu and cary towne center (tryon, avent ferry, buck jones, etc) and sometime between : and :pm.i got back on the scooter and rode to cary and i don't remember anything until several hours later (i'm pretty concussed), so i'm trying to figure out where i crashed and maybe what the hell happened."

"no one was taking photos 'surreptitiously'. your friend injured themselves doing something outside of their liability through their work site. taking photos is standard protocol to document things, record the state of the site, and ensure that the staging was done correctly. also, your friend was in a public space meaning they don't have a legal expectation to privacy."
"disneyland offers rentals on a first come first serve basis, $/day. also, there are many companies that will deliver and pick up the scooter from the hotel that are much cheaper."
"esk spills are easier to run out since you're usually thrown forward instead of domino style, but they also have the potential to happen at higher speeds. unless you have pneumatic tires and/or a decent longboard deck, yeah you're going to eat it if you hit a bump wrong. onewheels also have issues with bumps but not always to the same extent. it really depends on rider skill, i've eaten it after wobbling from bumps but my friends can usually handle it.conclusion: a little safer at the same speeds but can get pretty nasty the faster you go. maybe a little less common that onewheel spills."

"tldr:  year old virgin is hornyso, as my tldr reads above, i am a  year old virgin. a bit of a backstory of myself, i was your typical fat kid in elementary school.the first few years i was bullied pretty heavily. i remember one particular instance in st grade of  kids circling me, pushing me into the ground and repeatedly yelling ""fat ass"" at me. i remember thinking they were just messing around with me but the longer it went on i felt more and more embarrassed. now, some kids would have been taught to fight back. however for me, my mom would always tell me to avoid fighting because i didn't know my own strength. she wasn't wrong. i was just under  feet tall by the end of kindergarten, i was already a heavy boy. id have fucked those kids up lmao. but because i was the soft nice fat kid, i was an easy target. luckily i found friends later, we called ourselves the fat ass crew because we were all chubby. we had the best lunch sessions!while all this is going on, i had started to question where my dad was. it wasn't something i thought about until school. the first time i heard about a ""donuts with dad"" i was like, ""wait, why dont i have a dad"" 😂😂 so i asked. my mom said she would find him for me, but wanted to wait until i wanted to. he was in and out of prison, they didn't tell me at the time, i just knew i would only get calls from him at certain times of certain days.fast forward, my dad gets out. im about / years old. he brings me a purple remote control car, it was cool, but purple? lol, i was more of a red and black kinda boy. he talks to me for a bit, i am overly ecstatic, i even take him to my uncle and say, ""this is my dad!"" and he's just like, yeah, we know.they also knew what a piece of shit he was. unfortunately i didn't. after speaking to me for a few moments he told me to test out the car, and he went outside to talk to my mom. most visits went like that. spend - minutes with me, then go talk to my mom. my mom told me later in life he would just come over to try and get back with her, he wasn't really there for me.fast forward a few months later. i am finally going to his house! i'm excited. i get dropped off and meet my half brother and aunt who were both around the same age, my aunt maybe  years older. i was awkward as fuck. i didn't know how to make friends unless they walked up to me first. so after a few minutes of awkward talking i go inside to hangout with my dad, he's smoking what i thought was a cigarette lol, and watching music videos. he finishes his joint and sits on the couch for a bit. and that was it lol. thats all we did for an hour or two before i got picked up.the next time, it's just me and him. i get there, and he talks to me for a minute then tells me to go upstairs and sit on the bed. i do. for over an hour. he left, and i sat on the bed. he came back, checked on me, went downstairs and my mom picked me up. i never told her that. i don't know why.the next few visits he would do the same thing. leave me on the bed. i remember at times i would cry, other times i would walk around and look at things. then i would go home and tell my mom it was fine. however, finally he tells me ""you hungry? you want taco bell"" fuck yeah my little fat ass does! so we get in the car! we're doing something! together! he tells me we have to get gas, he gets out of the car and walks up to this guy outside. they do a handshake and he comes back to the car. strange, didn't see him put gas in. next we drive into a really really sketchy neighborhood. as we pull up to this group of like  dudes, lots of red shirts or red bandanas, drinking alcohol in the open, he tells me ""do not get out of the car, for anything"" fuckin right i'm not getting out this car. he walks over to a guy, does his handshake, gets back in and we head to taco bell. as we walk in, he sits me down in an area, then goes over to this guy in the corner. they talk, then begin to argue, loudly, my dad comes over and says ""c'mon get in the car we gotta go"" very urgently. so we go, i go back to the bed upstairs and sit. he's running through the house yelling at his gf who was there, saying ""where the fuck my hat at. bxxxh i know you put it away where my hat at."" then it was his sweater he couldn't find. it was close to summer, it was probably put away. he must have found it because i hear him slam the door as he got in his car and sped off. i didn't tell my mom that until later either. i didn't hear from him for a few weeks after that.few weeks go by and i ask if i can go over. i do, and we are going to the park! to feed the ducks even! we go and i have a blast, we had a picnic, those doritos hit different that day. we went and fed the ducks, when suddenly a duck just started chasing me! i ran screaming for my life thinking this duck was gonna poke my eye out or something 😂 my dad goes ""son, why you runnin! its just a duck!""as we start leaving i walk up and say ""hey bob (not his name just for not too much info) thanks for taking me today, it was fun!"" (my mom instilled great manners into me) he replies ""bob? why don't you call me dad?"" i didn't have an answer. but i wonder if even then i knew he wasn't much of a dad.i didn't see him for a couple of weeks, then i got my nd grade report card. all a's and  b! i was so proud. i brought it home to my mom excited to show her, and she was proud, but i was extra excited to show my dad. this would make him proud. this would make him love me. i call, and ask if i can go over because i wanted to show him something, he says not this weekend. i call again the following weekend, not this weekend.finally i try the third weekend in a row. i dial the number and i get that noise that phones would make when they're busy. i wait a few minutes and dial again, same thing. i wait a few moments and dial again, this time i get ""we're sorry but the number you have called has been disconnected."" i looked at the paper his number was written on, and punch in the numbers again. same thing. i try again extra careful that i wasn't hitting the wrong buttons. same thing... my heart dropped into my stomach, i was then filled with rage. i went into my room, punched a hole in my wall and ripped the only picture i had of him. school suffered for me after that, i never got above a . after because i was like fuck school. i didn't know why i hated it but i did. i said i would do enough to graduate and thats it. i even told my mom i wanted to drop out of school, in th grade. i hated it. and i became a bully. i was so angry, everything would set me off. kid's who used to pick on me, didn't pick on me anymore. kid's who didn't pick on me, were in danger if i felt they even looked at me the wrong way. it was bad, i was so fucking hateful and angry every. single. day.so, girls weren't a thing then. though i did want a girlfriend, my anger towards the world kept me from doing anything but be pissed off.fast forward to middle school. we are broke, i had  pairs of shorts and  t shirts for the entirety of my th grade year. clothes my size cost much more than everyone else my age. so my mom would only be able to get me things if they were on a huge sale. so many ""is that your favorite shirt or something"" comments being made. the first month or so, i walked alone, no friends from elementary school that i could see. eventually i ended up finding one of my old friends from elementary (part of the fac!) and started kicking it with him again, we were basically part of the skaters/rockers/emo kids. we used to do such dumb shit at school lmao, we would routinely set off the school sprinklers soaking all the preppy and sports kids on the hill, we once tied a bull rope to a few people's backpacks and they would run full speed, you can guess what happened next lol. we would take fishing wire and wrap it around bench legs that were adjacent to each other trying to get people to trip, or even acting like we were just to watch people go around for nothing. pushing each other down hill in a shopping cart like jackass. great times.then there was this girl. she was so pretty, into all the bands i liked, and we would talk a ton! i was falling in love and after a few months, valentines day is coming up. i was going to give her chocolates, a card, her favorite stuffed animal (elephant) her favorite chips and soda. i told her i really liked her and asked if she would be my valentine and go out with me. she took the stuff, looked at me, gave me a huge hug and said ""guywritingthispost, you would be an awesome boyfriend, but youre just too big for me""crushed. i walked away very fast because i could feel the tears welling up. i never spoke to her again. and i gave up on girls.once th grade came around i started doing football. i couldnt play however because of a weight limit. i was close to  pounds, as an th grader. and my coaches let everyone know it. i walked into the locker room as they were doing physicals, checking weight, all that. i see the number on the scale and am kind of in shock. a bit embarrassed too. it was like  something. about an hour later, a few kids from the team came up to me teasing me about it, which is funny because no one was in that locker room to see but me and  other coaches. fuck them. to this day, fuck them.so football doesn't start how i'd like, i practice, i run, i do all that but i don't get to play. but i started this, so i will finish. and finish i did, despite having players come up to me and say ""i would quit if i were you, you don't even get to play why do you practice""exactly, you aren't me, i don't fucking quit.enter freshman year. i go into hs with one goal in mind: get to college. i decided before it started, i would focus on school and football. no girls, no fun, nothing, just stay focused. i wanted to go to college, and yeah dream scenario you go to the nfl and make millions. i wasn't naive, i knew that was a legitimate  in a million chance. but i knew if i could get to college, get a degree, and a good paying job i could finally do what my ultimate goal was: buy my mom a house.my mom was and is everything. she has held me down more than i probably deserve. she worked so fucking hard to give me what she could, she was no where near perfect, but damn did she work her ass off for me. i still to this day want to repay her, by buying her that beach house she has always dreamt of since i was a kid. shout out to mom.everything was going well, i did find this one girl really attractive, and she would always come over and sit next to me in class when we were allowed to move. she would even let me copy her homework lol. the bad part? i was oblivious as all hell to what she wanted. she would always come over and try to talk but my awkward ass never picked up on it, not even when she said ""you know, my parents are never home after school, you could always come over and hang out"" nice fuckin catch there kid, you had it, you fumbled it.my plan of sticking to football actually started to work. my goal was to go to texas, i love bbq, football, partying, and white girls, it is what it is. i started getting letters from smaller colleges, nothing huge, until a scout from ucla pulls me aside during weight lifting, he asks me a few football questions, and then ended by asking what my grades are like. i replied ""good enough for football"" he cracked up, i think he liked the answer as it was probably one of the most honest ones he had gotten.outside of that i got a phone call from texas tech! the rest were just letters from a few other schools, those two were the biggest.my coaches told me, i didn't even need to be amazing, my size alone would make schools want to see if they can make a project out of me. i was about '  as a sophomore. i was strong as fuck too. benched , squatted  pounds, cleaned  (kinda sucked at those) and could leg press over  pounds. i was moving quick for my size too. i was working with some top coaches around the valley. i was making my way to where i wanted to be by working my ass off and it was paying off.until it didn'ti get to the end of sophomore year, and am ready for the upcoming summer camp and season. we are doing this stupid program (that i later found out was just some experiment for this dude's college thesis) and they make us do this drill where we have to cross the street walking on only objects provided. i thought it was the dumbest shit ever, let me go to the field and do conditioning, something that actually makes me better.nope. one particular kid calls out ""if we have to do it xxx should have to to!"" fucker. i do, and i get to the object that i was actually afraid of. a square with wheels. wheels and i dont mix, i stepped on a skateboard and busted my ass. no thank you.i should have just told everyone to fuck off. but i put my left foot forward, onto the square, and it flew out from under me taking my leg with it, my right knee crashes down into the pavement popping hard, i fall backwards on my leg, and another pop happens as i straighten it out. i laid there for a minute, the team was laughing a few tried to help me up, but the laughter pissed me off. at this point nothing hurt but the scrape on my leg, and my pride. as i stand up however, i literally feel my tendon rip. ends up being a torn acl, on a normal sized person it's still a devastating injury, but on someone +, it is amplified. it felt like i had no leg, nothing but air. i dragged myself to a nearby tree while the rest of the team started to head to the field.now from here, a lot happens from the time of me getting better but i wont touch every detail. when i inittially tore my acl, no one helped me to the trainers room, not a single coach. in fact, when i asked my coach if he could call someone with a cart, he told me to ""figure it out"" so i walked  plus minutes, well i grabbed on to walls helping me move, until i got to the trainers room. who gave me ice, and told me i needed to go to the field after  minutes. pretty much because she wanted to go home. thanks kort!i hobble to the field and sit down, within seconds a coach runs over ""why are you sitting down, take a knee if youre hurt"" mother fucker my knee is what hurts. so i found a tree and hid behind it until practice was over. a guy a grade above me came and said he saw what happened. i gave him my info and he went and grabbed me everything i needed from my locker, and took me home. helped me inside and told my grandma what happened.later after this, it took a while before i could get an mri + the results. within that time coaches started putting it in my head that i was ""being soft, and that a lot of players play on torn meniscus'"" my head coach even threatened to put me on jv if i didn't practice soon.so i practiced. i cried in my helmet every day from the pain of trying to run. it was almost impossible but i found a way. unfortunately it probably did more damage than good. i missed my jr year, and my senior year, i had ballooned up from being depressed and injured. mentally every step i took i was afraid my knee would blow out again. i played  maybe  plays, my entire senior year.i was lost. my future that i had been working so hard for was now gone. i didn't know who i was or what i was supposed to do now.so i got more depressed and kept eating. i got to the point, that when i graduated i was pushing over  pounds. '  pounds.luckily, i found mma. ironically through my mom, what a badass. that was my saving grace. i worked out non stop. i would wake up and go lift at the gym from am til  am, head home, eat something small, watch mma, workout, eat, watch mma and then workout one final time. every single day. i was dead set on either fighting or competing in some combat sport. i was dropping weight like crazy.there was a bjj tournament coming up and i was going to enter it. unfortunately about  weeks out i messed my knee up, nothing major but it was bad enough i had to pull out. bummer but i would make the next one. the following year, it gets cancelled about a month out and that was the last of those tournaments in my area. a few weeks later, i am working out with  others who would train with me, i am walking around when suddenly pop.my knee pops and i stand frozen in fear. it was a loud enough pop that both of them heard it and were concerned. i took another step, pop. another step, pop. pop. pop. pop. i sit down begging for it to go away. i sit and coach them up for about an hour before their workout was over. we talked for a bit, i stood up tried to take a step and pop. another half hour goes by, they're about to leave but want to make sure i can get to my room, it's still popping and luckily we had some crutches.the next few months were really bad, but the years were even worse.it was almost impossible to get an mri, whether you live in the us or not, you have heard time and time again our healthcare is shit.so, i was on my own. i could barely get around the house, which led me to laying in bed a lot. which led to unchecked depression. i gained a ton more weight. to the point, that the scale read  at one point. i hadn't even hit my lowest point yet.this went on for over  years. i beat myself up, mentally, physically and emotionally. i started to self harm, and the fact that my mom wasn't noticing, fed those evil voices in my head telling me that no one cares about me, i am a failure and a nuisance, a burden on those around me. i deserved to die and let them live better lives. planning on killing yourself for several years takes its toll. especially when you reach the age you were planning on doing it, and you're still alive. a year after, you're still alive, and lost, because the only future you knew, was suicide.eventually i started smoking weed, and this helped to calm down my brain from moving a million miles per hour. i had a conversation with myself, i said ""this isn't who you are, you don't give up, you fight."" and that's what i did, i got up and started to fight again.i began working out, i began doing my best to reflect and work through some of the things i have been through. i realized that through everything ive been through, some of it was self inflicted, while a lot of it, was just out of my control at times. hell my dad even came back into my life in hs just to leave my ass again. that hurt too, but i can either sit and dwell on it, all of it, or get up and try to make a better future.so that's what i started to do. losing weight, finally got back to a doctor recently, got prescribed meds for depression and bipolar disorder, linked up with a therapist and psychologist, even started working on my resume, and the scale is all the way down to the mid 's.the best part, was that i put myself on tons of dating sites, i'm  at the time. i've never had my first kiss. and to be quite honest, from the age of like , on, i have always wanted a girlfriend. women are amazing to me. they can make you feel amazing, or amazingly shitty.now being a virgin at / may not be a big deal to some, it's probably because you've had sex, or at least a first kiss. so before anyone hits with the usual ""sex isnt all that"" ""fix yourself first"" i am allowed to want to have sex as i am now, and i don't need your opinion on how your sexual experiences have been, i have several friends who say ""yeah, sex is fucking awesome, you need to get on it already"" i want to expirience it myself, and form my own opinion on it.one of the biggest problems with being a virgin at my age, is that you get put into this weird place. other men look at you in shock when you tell them. women either don't want you because you are inexperienced, and they are not wrong, i have no clue what the fuck to do down there, but i am willing to learn. i am willing to use toys, whatever i must to please her. ill probably cum in like  strokes my first time lol, i am not unrealistic lol. so i'm easy, let me focus on you first. or, they see it as a red flag. most women who do, aren't gonna want to listen to this novel worth of shit, that led me to being a virgin still. then there's the few who don't care. honestly i thought there would be more women who didn't care, you legit get to mold me into your personal sex buddy, i will basically only know how to please you. my doctor was even shocked to the point she said ""wow usually your age, you're sexually active, and you played football?"" like yeah just playing football gets you laid. i fuckin wish. then it's the typical ""well you're saving yourself-"" no the fuck i am not. some are okay with it, i am not. i am incredibly sexually frustrated, i am horny as fuck every day since i was , i want to have sex, to the point that i almost had sex with homeless chick that was staying at the local shelter. we met on a dating app, and she denied me, when i told her i still lived with my mom, and did not have a car at the moment. a homeless girl, denied me for the lack of shit i had, hilarious lol.it's even more annoying that i am almost looked down upon for being tired of being a virgin. i feel like people are quick to try and yell incel. but i don't hate women, i am not mad at women for not liking me because i'm fat, or broke, or body is beat to shit, whatever, it sucks, it makes me sad, but i am mad at no one, except for myself at times. i am no incel, i am just a really tired dude, trying to push on with my life, but wants to fuck.back to the dating apps. it did not go well. hundreds of girls i messaged, each unique, i would look over the profile as closely as i could and try to strike conversation with them. nothing. hardly any replies. the ones i did get, were bots or gave me one word answers or ""i guess"" to everything.eventually before giving up, i went to a lesser known site. fetlife. figured, if i was gonna find a chick that did not mind a + pound dude that was trying to get life back together, and wanted to lose his virginity, but not have vanilla sex, it was probably there. however, the women in the area, were several times my age, or just generally unattractive to me. before giving up, i spot a teddy bear. i figured it would be someone into ddlg (do not kink shame me, we all deal with trauma differently, i chose not to write about the specific trauma that led me to it) she wrote a physical description of herself and it was all i had to go off of, but she talked to me. they talked to me. we talked for several months it was awesome even though i had no clue if she was who she said she was.she talked about how she was demi-sexual and it takes a long time for her to get close and boy did it. we talked for several months before she finally gave me her number. i actually got a girls number. valentines day was rolling around and i asked if we could do a phone date, she said why not a facetime date! facetime!? i get to see if its a guy or girl!?so we do, and... it was exactly what she wrote. , short dark hair, big glasses, crooked teeth but that mattered nothing to me because her smile made my heart and soul smile. she was small too, just a few inches above  feet and just a few pounds over  lbs. she ticked every box i had.she was sweet, caring, slim i like them small, into quite a few kinks i am into, funny, we like similar games and the ones that i didn't i was finding myself into just because she was so into them. i fell in love with how she would play with her fuzzy stuffed pokemon's ears as we watched dr. who. or all the cute fidget toys she buys, and tries to figure out if she likes them or not based on texture and how fun they are. i loved it. we both read, she reads lots of fanfic, specifically undertale which i thought was so cool. she is into mending her stuffed animals she even started watching pro wrestling for me a little bit just to talk to me about it. we talked for about - months and i have fallen so in love. people always ask, do you want sex or a relationship? why can't i want both? i want love. i want to have someone to lean on that isn't my family and friends. i have that, i love them, but it's time for me to have that other perspective. it's time to find a woman for myself. it's time to give someone all the love and cuddles that i have been building up for years. and i want to fuck, or at least a blowjob.i felt that after all this time, my feelings of love were warranted. i knew she wasn't where i was, we both made where we were - very clear to each other. she eventually gave me the place that she works. a cute pizza shop her parents own, about  minutes from me. i had yet to head over, because i was still broke, jobless and nervous. i couldn't just show up and eat for free, so i waited. conversations carried on like normal, we had another ft date or two. but just recently, i have yet to hear from her in  weeks. there was no inclination of anger, or sadness, nothing she said sounded like she was ready to leave. everything was normal. and she just disapeared. she would routinely disapear for a few days, and said her mental health leaves her unable to communicate outside of work. i understand that as someone with mental health issues myself, but  weeks can be worrisome. she is either really bad off, or has ghosted me. my number isn't blocked but no calls or messages have been answered, and it is the saddest i have been in quite some time. the only woman to give me the time of day, the only woman to openly talk about both of our insecurities of ourselves and our bodies, and still talk, still be there for me, she even knows about my buried penis (fat ppl probs, not a micro penis) that is a huuuuuuuuuuuuge insecurity of mine for good reason.but then she just disappeared. i fantasized about our first date, holding her hand for the first time, having that first kiss where she has to get on her tippy toes just to touch my lips with hers. the first time we go in for a hug and don't let go. sitting in my room talking as music plays. playing with her hair, kissing her forehead, giving cuddles, losing my virginity to her, having her rest her head on my belly as she blows me. having my giant hands explore a woman's body for the first time. everything. and now all i do is cry, because she's gone. i was so in love and i knew she didn't feel nearly the same, but almost a year of sending eachother essay sized texts, talking about anything and everything, i thought it wouldn't go down like this. getting ghosted. i haven't felt this low in a long time.i know i have to get up again, start fighting, lose some more weight, keep applying to jobs, all that. but fuck am i tired. my body hurts, it is beat up. i can't walk for more than - minutes before my knees, back and hips want to explode in pain. i am still over  pounds, and i could lose  over the next . years, but so many women still wouldn't see that. i'd still be over  pounds. no one sees the amount of work i put in. no one sees the pain i have to get through to finish a workout in + degree heat. no one sees all the steps i am taking to try and better my life. so that maybe i can finally be attractive. but god damn, i just wanna be held while i do so. i want to cuddle. do i want sex fuck yeah, but at the end of the day, i wanna find my girl. the one i get to talk to all the time. the one that i can hang out with all day and never get sick or bored of them. i have such a long road to keep going down, i am fucking tired, i want to give up, but that's not me, i don't fucking quit.i know a blowjob wouldn't fix a majority of my problems, but it would sure as hell make them a little bit easier to deal with, even if only for a few moments."
if i knew everyone was going to berate me after needing advice for damage from a car crash i wouldn’t have posted lol
"safety. gear. trust us: you will crash at some point. best to have it be just a scare, rather than a potentially life-altering injury!"
"hi guys! thanks for taking the time to read this.i've got a broken elbow at the moment (skateboarding injury), in other words, i've got about  weeks off work.i want to take this time to try and achieve something awesome, and i'm just looking for some advice on how i can do that. my plan is to make a  defence,  prayer chivarly build, it looks so awesome on paper but i've literally never seen any video's on that sort of account, or seen it out there in runescape. getting to my point i'm starting to wonder if it's even possible to complete all the quests necessary while keeping  defence,  prayer and being able to use chivalry.thanks in advance."
"the speed limits are thankfully low, so a car would be a much better idea."
"[photo ]( ]( fell on my side while skating on a half-pipe when i was young. and then i fell on it again, which probably caused it to scar. if it's going to be there forever it might as well look pretty. any ideas?"

also using an electric skateboard of electric scooters if you cause an accident you are not insured. at all.
"stating from a stop feels abrupt.  scooter kicks back on its soft suspension and gets front wheelspin.  after the first - feet, it feels sluggish.  approaching my set mph limit seems inconsistent and slow, dawdling around at -mph on a flat road sometimes.  on the other hand, low speed maneuvers at walking pace are especially well controlled.  the motor programming is overall different than i am used to.  i am using the top sport mode and level  for both accel and regen.  the comfort mode is unpleasant to me and seems capped at mph so i stopped using it after several blocks, and i didn’t bother to test eco."

"always wear a helmet when unsecured on wheels (bicycle, skateboard, roller scates, hoverboard, etc). if you have a serious enough crash to call for emergency services, don't take the helmet off until they arrive."
"(as well as additional safety/crash test improvements but volvos are pretty safe as it is, so its not like the current cma platform is deficient here)"
"a helmet should never be drilled into, cut into or modified in any way that alters the composition or structure of the materials.  in professional racing helmets must be less than  or  years old because both sun and sweat cause the effectiveness to deteriorate.  if a helmet gets road rash or you drop it and it chips the outer layer, it will no longer pass tech inspection. it should be pretty obvious that cutting holes in it goes against any manufacturers guidelines and warnings."

"i've only fallen off a scooter twice (both lime rentals), and in both cases it was because i was riding on a sidewalk and momentarily went off the edge into the grass.  the scooter stopped immediately, i didn't.fortunately the result was only an impressive -inch purple bruise on my left buttcheek, and damaged pride.lesson?  avoid riding on sidewalks and pay very careful attention to the ground in front of you, don't allow yourself to become distracted."

"foot position matters when learning.  your toes should be hanging off the front of each pedal, and if you find that you’re veering left or right on launch, adjust your foot position until you find that balance point for your launches.  if you get this wrong, everything will be exponentially harder so work hard trying to find where that sweet spot is for foot positioning for launches."

"i've personally been commuting solely by euc and e-scooter for  years now and while it is possible it has some major drawbacks. on rainy days i'll get a ride or uber to/from work depending on when it's raining, and during the winter i do the same depending on if the roads are salted and plowed or not. overall if i only owned one pev (i just keep buying more) i'll have saved a good amount of money on getting a car, getting insurance, and paying for gas. even if i owned a car % of my journeys would be on euc so it isn't in the cards for me just yet"

"ik the title may be confusing but i am unsure of where else to ask this question. basically i was trying to find a new hobby to learn, and i picked up skateboarding. i fell in love with it ( not more than jesus lols) but i really liked it and enjoyed being on the board. then i sprained my ankle on it pretty bad, its been almost  weeks and i got some crutches to help the healing process, and my mom says that this happened because i didn't listen to her to not ride a skateboard because its dangerous.but the thing is, i knew the dangers that would come, and i really wanted to ride the skateboard. i mean those dangers come with everything, learning how to ride a bike for example. like am i never supposed to learn how to skateboard or ride a bike because it can be dangerous? no, i enjoy the activity and am willing to pay some consequences until i am skilled enough to not injury myself frequently.however, after my foot heals, my mom wants me to not do skateboarding anymore, even mentioned selling it :(. and i wondered if it would be a sin if i continued doing it either way (with her knowledge hopefully) and if god would kind of punish me in a way if i continue skateboarding even when my mom advised that i shouldn't. but i really do like skateboarding. but i also don't want to go against god if he's speaking through my mother? but i also find that my mother's logic isn't exactly right either...all responses are appreciated. below your comments please add anyrhing you want me to pray for you for ans i will :-)."
"while sequels white and red would go on to involve themselves with the trio’s others of equality and fraternity, the age-old french conception of liberty is what kickstarter three colors blue pertains to at its heart, and it is i would say a “freedom from” over “freedom to” type. the ability to do things freely is what people tend to want to die for and what they think freedom means before anything else, but just as valuable is feeling safe and secure in the assurance that threatening forces aren't going to be penetrative. in this case, that is excruciating memory. julie, the principal character of this installment, is in a cell of fate’s making, and posted at the top of that prison is “grief.” the most personal loss of life for many is worse than losing your own, and if it’s in doubt the first act we see julie take is treating that as a more acceptable alternative. through the course of blue she repeatedly endures sudden voids of energy and drive even after attempts to continue living, and in this despondent funk she’s propelled forward by purely mechanical movements."

[research shows that from - there have been more than , injuries as a result of e-scooters. ]( to help avoid these accidents and prevent injuries:**. **ride on the street:** you should protect yourself and pedestrians on the sidewalk by always riding on the street.. **always wear a helmet:**in order to best protect yourself and other vulnerable road users, when using an e-scooter, ensure that you always wear protective clothing such as a safety helmet, elbow pads and knee pads.    you should also wear light colors or fluorescent clothing so other road users can see you.   these measures are important for your protection from serious injuries and may possibly save your life.. **check your scooter for safety & functionality:**ensure that your scooter is properly functioning.  a quick test of the scooter is recommended before riding.### what to do in case of an e-scooter accident?first, determine which area of the body is associated with injury.  special care is required in case of neck, back, and head injuries.  immediately seek medical attention if you are injured.   if there is an involvement of another party, then you should call law enforcement.### legal outcomes that may arise due to these accidents, include:**your e-scooter hits a pedestrian:**if an e-scooter hits a pedestrian, then [the rider can be held responsible for all the injuries sustained by the pedestrian.]( vehicle hits an e-scooter:**if the driver of a vehicle crashes into an e-scooter and is at fault, [he can be held liable for all the damage to the e-scooter, and the driver must compensate for it.]( hits a vehicle:**if an e-scooter causes damage to another vehicle, then the rider of the e-scooter may be at fault and may have to compensate for the damages to the vehicle.**injuries and consequences:**a lot of riders don't wear a helmet or any protective gear and e-scooters are very easy to fall.   researchers found that e-scooter riders sustained more injuries per mile than bicyclists and were twice as likely to be injured because of potholes, pavement cracks, lampposts, and signposts.  e-scooter accidents can cause cervical, facial and head injuries.  torn ligaments, broken jaws, ankles and wrists are also common injuries as well as traumatic brain injuries, which can further cause internal bleeding and lead to coma or even death.  e-scooters are not a toy and should be treated with the same care and caution as when operating any other type of motor vehicle.### [hilton and somer, llc]( [motor vehicle accident attorneys]( serving maryland, virginia, and district of columbiaif you’ve been injured on, or by an e-scooter due to the negligence of another, contact hilton & somer, llc today to learn more about your legal options.  all our accident cases are handled on a contingency fee basis.  this means that you pay nothing unless we recover a monetary reward for your case.  [contact our experienced team]( or call us now, to schedule a free consultation!

"hello, i'm an incoming freshman to ut and i bought an electric skateboard. do you know if electric skateboarding is legal at ut and how is the conditions for riding it. do you think it will be wise to bring an electric skateboard to ut to commute to class everyday?"
"i totally agree with some of your points. specifically, there should be a law requiring everyone to wear a helmet when riding a bicycle or electric scooter. many places with directly funded healthcare have these laws on the books already. skiing isn’t really on public roads so it’s kind of a different situation."
even if tsla beats earnings they’re still overpriced compared to everything else that has gone down. they almost have to correct
"when i was in san francisco near the waterfront, a tv camera crew was robbed in daylight.  there are also ""smash & grab"" robberies at louis vuitton in the shopping district of sf & palo alto - very posh areas."
"however, if your problem is that cars go dangerously fast, and the danger of a crash is high... motorcycle riders have more vulnerability, but a motorcycle still can have quite a bit more kinetic energy than a bicycle both in terms of mass and velocity. and, even  cc can go quite fast. still a win compared to cars, but not much of one (although it gets better the smaller you go, and  cc in some countries is treated as compatible with bicycles)."
"hi all, so my male friend was involved in a fairly nasty accident around pm by the / on meade and th in north park. concussion, lots of blood, ambulance,etc. he was on a bird scooter but is a mature rider and highly unlikely to be messing about. due to the concussion he does not recall the incident but as a regular (safe) scooter rider he feels there’s more to this story than just falling off. perhaps a hit and run or bad driver causing him to swerve, etc. he also has a massive bruise on his palm perhaps from gripping onto the handlebar at last minute to avoid going down. seems not like a simple fall but more of a ‘danger’ situation. idk did anyone happen to see this incident? any info helps. thanks."
"it's as simple as that really, don't go through red lights as traffic coming from the other roads could hit you and cause serious injury. i'd just take it as a lesson learned."
"seeking advice and or information.  i am from the grand rapids area and looking to get my medical marijuana card.  i want to be able to use cannabis without worrying about getting ticketed or arrested.  anyone know the best places to get a card in holland/grand rapids michigan?  i don't have a specific health condition, just some moderate anxiety and the some mild knee pain from a skateboarding injury.  thanks in advance!"
"i was skateboarding and then i fell off and hit the concrete hard.  i had a thumb injury which teared a small skin wound that bleed, then i accidentally (without knowing) touched the hand rail which had rust on the side, and also touched my post box which had rust.  i read on the internet being stabbed with rusty metal is dangerous and should go to the er as the rust/blood could affect your body.  is this the same?  this happened this morning ( hours ago) and i feel nothing weird has happened, my friend's dad (who is a doctor) said flesh wound on my finger and then ""touching"" metal having rust is completely different from a sharp rusty metal stabbing my body.**should i be worried about anything? skin, blood, bacteria, eyes, other health problems?**"
"i think the main issue with gear isnt that we're not warning people enough. there's plenty of us here telling others to gear up. hell, helmets are rule  of the subreddit. the main issue, i think, is that people under-estimate just how dangerous an e-skate crash is. crash on something like a scooter going  kmh (~ mph)? you'll likely be okay. crash on an e-skate at the same speed though? you'll be ejected into the road standing straight up with nothing to save you. people dont seem to understand just how dangerous that is."
"i'm not quite elderly yet and i had an electric scooter like you're describing. even for shorter distances the standing position on it left my legs feeling pretty gummy afterward. additionally i had a near-catastrophic crash when i went over a small dip in a residential street because its small wheels were evidently no match for the terrain. to me the weight distribution also just feels less safe, standing upright."

the citibiker was visibly shaken at how close of a call it was. while the e-scooter guy didn't miss a beat and just laughed about it as he sped off. i've seen more accidents involving e-scooters than anything else so far.

"dear r/ukmedicalcannabis family&#xb;i'd like to share my appreciation to everyone and for everything that has been shared, discussed expressed and improved within this community for the sake of information and the ability for everyone eligible to learn about how they can access medical cannabis legally within this country, and reduce pain and suffering.&#xb;i suffer from adhd, complex ptsd, chronic insomnia ( years +), anxiety and depression.i also have a bulging spinal disc from a skateboarding injury in my early teens, and carpel tunnel wich causes me so much pain and emotional instability, the pain is overwelming in every way to the point i cannot cope.ive been perscribed stimulant medication, ssri's, ticyclics, maoi & mood stabilisers and relaxants like diazepam and alprazolam with little to no succession in the past, other than depressive moodswings, low libido, psychological numbnes and weight gain.ive also been cycled on these perscriptions for pain management: codein phosphate and nsaid, gabapeptin, morphine sulphate, oxycodone and fentanyl wich caused me ulcers. i enjoy researching everything, like getting into the pharmakokinetics or the mechanism of action of these medications before i take the informed decision to ingest any substance.&#xb;im a strong cannabis advocate with a scientific approach, and have been since my early teens but did not fully know i was self medicating until i saw a psychiatrist and though to be brutally honest on how the plant helped me - although they didnt agree with me it was noted and discussed. &#xb;for the past  years i've been medicating with uk concentrates, specifically dabbing -% (check my posts xd) oil, wax, badder, shatter, water hash rosin & thca islolate (diamonds and sauce) as well as edibles, tinctures, and top shelf no till, organic live soil flowers from reputable uk growers and refineries and breeders - we have alot! i consume around -mg of thca every day wich costs me a whopping £- (-g of extract per month) - self funded so thought why not try cannabis legally, even though until the strength of uk medical cannabis is increased or they allow concentrates to be perscribed, i will still be using my extracts as it provides a different echelon of relief for the sake of analgesia and emotional stability.&#xb;i had my appointment today through telemedicine, it was a breeze and have been perscribed g ( indica  sativa) for my monthly use. i asked about the tilray master kush but the doctor didnt have it in their spreadsheet with all the medications they could perscribe, so i went with noidecs indica (i remember something like -% thc?) and spectrum red  sativa for now. something to note, the doctor said they would reffer me to pt for my next appointment, as i fall well within the criteria of the pt, and that would help pioneer the audit that is currently taking place in the uk regarding medicinal cannabis. &#xb;i'm really pleased and awaiting a call from dispesary green for my payment details.&#xb;my wife bought me a gift, and i couldn't believe it, i was really extatic!&#xb;[ the mighty!]( really appreciate everyone's contributions to the subreddit, even lurkers like myself prior to this post we are all in this together, and you should not be made to suffer.we got this r/ukmedicalcannabis family&#xb;tl;dr had my initial consultation and got perscribed indica and sativa, overall very pleased with the process and cannot wait!&#xb;best regardsorganix"
"hi, i've rented a scooter and just as i park up, i was very clumsy and accidentally banged the scooter mirror against a wall and it's came off. i'm taking it back tomorrow, however how much should i be charged for the mirror fix?"
no morning traffic.
"ich habe jetzt nichts schriftliches schau dir aber mal die bilder des antriebstranges an. die batterie mit achsträgern und eats  ist quasi die bodengruppe, auf die die karosserie aufgesetzt wird. das ""skateboard"" kann theoretisch ohne karosserie fahren. die batterie ist tragenden teil des gesamten fahrzeugs, ist aber aus crash gründen so konstruiert, dass sie die kräfte seitlich ableitet und so die hauptzelle der batterie, also da wie alle zellblöcke drin sind, intakt bleibt. hab am anfang einige crash dummys aufgebaut, weiß daher ein klein bisschen wie das ding funktionieren soll :)"
"it’s a small city, only about  law firms that deal in injury suits. lots of old money in the city government."
"hayden was seen on a number of occasions on november  struggling to control the dog as it lunges towards people walking to and from the shop, including nearby children. salter can be seen to be present during some of the incidents, including while the dog is barking viciously and pulling towards a young girl, who looks fearful and retreats behind a car."
"i had an older well-heeled rich guy who caught some fentanyl trying to party, and get plenty of meth heads who are using all kinds of crazy shit accidentally catch some fentanyl. and the pro skateboard kids who were trying to party (no friend, it was not cocaine and this is why you continue to go unconscious), the premed girls at tosu who were trying to study using some fake adderall, etc etc."
"there's no real limits to them other than not going in the road, so it was pretty crazy sometimes, especially during busy commuting times or on weekends/evenings. and you can go pretty fast on them! the difference is though, the pavement in nz are at least twice as wide as uk pavements, so there's usually quite a bit of room for scooters to get past. here i imagine they could easily be a nuisance and cause a few accidents if they're allowed on pavements, and road accidents if on the roads! they could be allowed in cycle lanes maybe, but depends on the quality of the cycle lane"

"thinking about it, i’m looking at the “ground clearance is a problem” and am wondering whether people are trying to make their ventkids-endorsed skateboard compete with a low-orbit ship killing flying machine by charging all over the roughest of terrain at max speed and crashing into everything"
"the  pound vsett +, while heavy, is also a significant percentage of the total weight of me plus the scooter with most of that weight down low because of the motors and battery. so it lowers the center of gravity, helping to keep both tires on the ground."
matza ball soup when you’re sick.
"i have seen a little knee scooter people use when they have a foot injury.  i wondered if that would be possible to use if i have limited mobility, but it is usually also accompanied by weakness of the corresponding arm.  have you considered a knee scooter?"
"“okay so your fine, and are you on your way out of the city?”"
"in on ( the fault determination rules for auto accidents are provincially regulated), if there is any accident between a vehicle and a pedestrian, the vehicle is held at fault % of the time, unless the pedestrian is charged by police."
i know this isnt an electric skateboard sub but i thought i'd ask this anyway in case anyone might be able to help
a mph collision is quite serious (% pedestrian fatality rate); a mph collision is spectacularly serious (% pedestrian fatality rate).
"'sup fellow tree-huggers. just recently got into oliver, i liked the ep but movement and hurt have me insanely hyped for ugly is beautiful. but recently, between the genius video and parodies (which i know are fake) and his live show, i've become a bit confused on the meanings of his songs. at first i had thought it was all character, and that's what perspective the songs were from, but then he used the real names of his band and it seems like hurt is actually about a scooter injury. so, is the oliver character just a over the top version of himself? was he actually a scooter pro? i'm looking to clear some things up, but i also just want to discuss his use of character in general and how it connects with his music. thx y'all, and see you down below!"
"i was walking next to southern cross station last night, two girls on electric scooters came blasting down the street while honking their bells at me to get out of their way. i completely stopped and stared at them because i froze for some reason, and to my delight the second girl somehow managed to lose control of her scooter and mildly crashed into a wall after suddenly swerving sideways because i didn’t move out of the way ☺️"
"ps anyone who honks at people are dumbasses who shouldnt have a license because they are unfit to drive responsable and safely, road ragers should have their licenses revoked for scaring other and new drivers by making them crash and miss their turns."
"punk houses were cool. they were very communal. as long as you covered your share of the rent, everything was fine. rent was usually dirt cheap though because these houses were borderline condemned. a couple had half pipes and you could skate and crash there and there was often people jamming in the basement or just parting or hanging out. lots of movie nights. if you got kicked out of your house or you ran away or something, they were better places to go than homeless shelters or bus stops."
"once training starts, there has also been a new, more intense feel to the sessions, now led by the team’s new physical preparation specialist ivan torres. a childhood friend of xavi in the catalan town of terrassa, torres has previously worked as fitness coach at bahrain’s olympic side, aek larnaca and leeds united before joining xavi at al-sadd."
jasmines ankle injury is giving me christmas vibes - someone find a scooter
"i was hugely influenced by guys like tony hawk and the bones brigade when i first started skating but by the early s, skating had evolved and turned not quite as punk but a lot more diverse in styles. still kept the attitude though."
"happens everywhere tbh, a lot of idiots on the road here and everywhere else, can easily remember at least a dozen cars getting hit by the tram in downtown calgary, despite being fenced off and automated, once saw a woman in canada fail to understand the concept of temporary traffic lights and crash straight into roadworks, mind boggling."
braking
"because of this, the car had to be crash-worthy even without the battery pack in place, which meant the frame was a lot heavier than it could have potentially been if the battery pack were part of the structure. this is what elon meant by the structural pack having ""negative weight"". switching to the new design allowed them to reduce the weight of other parts of the car because the pack could start taking over some of the duty of providing rigidity and strength to the body."
if errok is successful in clearing out mines she can always take time while he’s focusing on killing lomo to spread her supply once more! with chunks of debris charged with pressure she can even remotely spread footstep mines if any area happens to be no-go.

"i usually walk a total of  miles a day to get to school/work. however due to a rapid onset of hospitalizations, i learned i may be dealing with a chronic illness/disability that can limit my mobility going forward. one of my friends recommended looking into electric scooters. however, my anxiety is off the shits and have no experience with them. i know many people view them as a plague, infesting and dooming our inner city. please help me be as tolerable as possible to those around me. how do i navigate downtown with poor biking infrastructure arguably equally as insufferable drivers, to ensure they don't grant me a more cost effective and merciful death than my failing heart?some more specific questions for those with disabilities: - i am losing feeling in my hands/arms - what is the grip trigger thing like? how much pressure do you need, and is this something that can be modified? - how balanced/stable are they? i don't fall/blackout but i find myself in sudden bouts of dizziness and don't want to end up launching myself. thank you everyone for any suggestions you can provide."

crashes are not only less common on bicycles and scooters but importantly you're a lot less likely to die in a bicycle crash than a car crash. the reason car crashes are bad isn't that two things hit each other. it's that someone got hurt or died.

"although i can't remember the accident happening, i was on my longboard coming up a hill when i hit a large crack, fell backwards, and landed on my head, crushing my skull and causing a brain contusion."
"title. i was going down a huge slope really really fast when i lost control and fell. i rolled forward on the harsh concrete scraping my back, arm and piercing the skin on my hand. sure it stung a bit where the scrapes were but while everyone was worried for my well-being while cleaned my wounds, i secretly felt a ton of joy, happiness, and serenity (even if it was fleeting).since covid and lockdown, i’ve been living with my parents preparing to leave home after college. i’ve felt so *so* dead inside. like i was just wasting away at home, waiting to die. it hurt so fucking much going through the motions laying in bed and doing relatively nothing all day. when is going down that slope, i remembered what it feels like to have some adrenaline soar through my body, feel air race across my scalp, the razor thin edge between joy and fear blurring as i move faster and faster down the slope. it was so *refreshing*. even when i feel and was hurt, i felt more relief than pain, and it calmed me.it was just nice to feel alive again."
"i’m trying to bulk up but i think my very cardio heavy lifestyle is holding me back. i have been training . years and skateboarding the entire time and my gains have been pretty abysmal, although i have a good toned body and my lifts go up regularly, i have not gained much mass.the only solid gains i have made were during a short lgd + mk cycle, but even tho it felt pretty good i decided i’m going to avoid peds until i build a solid natural foundation.my test is somewhat low at ng/dl at , but i have only ever tested my total and not free. (tested before sarm use)i workout  times a week ppl split and eat .k calories daily. i also skateboard  times a week for around .- hours per session. i think burn between - + calories per session, as i’m skating almost non stop with the occasional smoke brake every now and again 🌿.if i skate any less then this then my progress is very minimal. but if i maximize my skateboarding potential then i end up cutting muscle. which sucks because most of my social network at university is via me being on the comity team for the uni skating society.is there a good way to split my workouts / skate sessions which would allow me bulk while progressing in skateboarding ?ideally i would like to balance these two instead of picking one or the other. injuries are also a big point of concern as both sports make you prone to injuries (especially skateboarding lool).pushing my calories higher seems to be impossible unless i dirty bulk/ use mass gainer but that would make me significantly less athletic and hinder my skateboarding anyway."
"**booking an aew midcard championship****“hangman” adam page vs. pac – full gear****build:**this match hasn’t been announced as of yet but is pretty obvious it will happen. the match is likely to be confirmed this week with the hangman adam page and kenny omega vs. pac and jon moxley ( likely ) main event. i’d have page mainly interact with moxley and omega with pac so that we don’t give away the full gear matches right here. i’d keep moxley/omega and pac/page interactions to a limit. the heels go over with moxley pinning page. after the match pac vs. adam page graphic for full gear is shown on the titantron. uploaded to the aew youtube channel is a video promo by pac on adam page. he states that page is the golden boy of aew, the one to be the next big star and that makes pac sick. because for  whole years he was held down and treated like absolute dirt, and when he finally arrived to aew he was just there to replace moxley. so, at full gear pac is going to take out all this anger that has bubbled up inside him for too long! on adam page. on the // pac takes on cima in a match. it’s a hard hitting and fast paced match where the bastard pac is stiff as all hell. cima takes it to pac in the same way he did and responds with some really stiff shots. pac once again gets the win and is now - in singles competition. in the rd match of the evening adam page takes on darby allin in a rematch from aew dark from the night before in a tables match! page shows he isn’t a forced babyface and does some insane stuff in the match. allin also does some insane work, hitting a coffin drop into a stack of tables as the high one. in the end adam page hits a buckshot! ……!!**match:**firstly, the full gear card looks like this:*pre-show:*best friends and orange cassidy vs. **scu –** six-man tag team match**britt baker** vs. bea priestley – winner gets a shot at the aew women’s championship at the january ppv*main show:*the young bucks vs. **lax –** tag team match nyla rose vs. **riho © –**  out of  falls match for the aew women’s championship **lucha bros ©** vs. a boy and his dinosaur – tag team match for the aew tag team championshipspac vs. “hangman” adam page – singles match **jon moxley** vs. kenny omega – singles match **chris jericho** vs. cody – singles match for the aew world championship the match that was meant to happen at double or nothing, but thanks to politics we didn’t get that. hangman page enters first, coming out slowly staring at the floor, his health concealed by the bandana. he then pulls down his bandana, then looks up into the crowd posing as pyro goes off. the bastard pac comes out with a mean look on his face, coming out with bags under his eyes, unkept hair concealing his face and his eyes staring dead at adam page’s. pac starts the match off hot by pouncing adam page. he throws page over the ropes, then hits a shotgun dropkick off the apron! pac stares deranged through the crowd before hitting a suicide dive! pac rolls page back into the ring, but page hits a frankensteiner once pac enters the ring! they then have a drawn-out move exchange followed by strike exchange. pac and page battle on the apron, where pac goes for a baseball slide but page hops it, turn around, superkick by page! pac falls to the outside, where page hits an asai moonsault off the second rope! page gets the crowd going and hits a suicide dive! however, pac catches him, and hurls him into the barricade! pac then gets into a verbal fight with a crowd member. they then do some classic indy strong style with pac displaying his vicious side. he goes for a rings of saturn, but page gets out of it and hits a standing shooting star press! ……kick out!! more strong style but with a bit of high-flying mixed in. pac hits a series of chops to page in the corner, when page rises to the second rope and pushes pac down. page hops off the rope but pac hits a monkey flip, page lands on his feet. he turns around, pac hits a dragonrana!! ….…kick out!! pac pounds the mat and tosses page to the outside! pac then hits a springboard corkscrew senton!!! pac then secures page’s rope and starts to pelt him with it! page ducks a shot though, big boot by page! page pulls out a table and sets it up beside the apron. he goes for a suplex off the apron, but pac holds onto the ropes. pac lands on his feet, and kicks page in the gut. pac then hits a piledriver off the apron through the table!!!both men barely get to their feet and roll into the ring before the -count. they then have an emotional and stiff final exchange of strikes. both men run off the ropes at each other but page ducks and pac leaps over him. they then rebound off the ropes again and jump at each other, but page lands into an impaler ddt!! ……..kick out!!!! he gets to his feet with a stunned look on his face, not knowing what more he can do. from behind though, pac hits a sharp dragon suplex! he heads to the top ropes, red arrow!!!!!!!! …….…..!!!! pac wins!! after the match, pac stomps down on adam page. page rolls out of the ring and escapes up the ramp as pac looks on sadistically. this is short lived, as from behind jimmy havoc strikes him from behind with a steel chair! havoc rains down chair shots on pac before pac manages to escape. pac runs off up the ramp as he stares down jimmy havoc, both men a deadly look in their eyes. **build for faith and misery:**the next aew ppv is faith and misery, taking place january th . meaning we have about two months on our hands. the show after full gear sees jimmy havoc cutting a promo on his frustrations with aew. all he’s done is work aew dark and be put in multi-man matches where he can do some deathmatch guy stuff. he has proven he is not a deathmatch guy and he’s going to take out his frustrations on the biggest bastard in aew’s locker room, pac. jimmy wants a match with pac. he states pac is the most egotistical twat in this locker room. he acts like he’s the most dangerous and deadly man in aew when he’s not, jimmy is. pac then interrupts havoc and communicates only in death stares. pac then snatches the mic out of havoc’s hand and starts to speak passionately. he says he also wants a match with havoc, but pac is now - in aew and deserves a title shot. if havoc can get more than his current - record then pac will give him a shot. havoc responds that pac doesn’t think he’s good enough? well he’ll show he is, with a pinfall and submission only match tonight against anyone in the back. sammy guevera responds and they have a good match. havoc wins, making him - now. the next week, pac takes on shawn spears in singles competition. pac wins getting him to -. after the match he demands a title match when he’s interrupted by cody. cody says that pac will be getting a title shot, but not for the aew world or tag team championships. instead it will be for, a new aew championship! since you have earned this by your win/loss record – which you can follow on the power rankings – this title will be, the power championship! the way the title works is as follows: all wrestlers not holding a title will be in a power rankings. you move up  points by a win,  point by a draw and you don’t move at all after a loss. if you are number  in power rankings, you are the champion, however if you overtake the champ, you must wrestle them to win the title. if you lose you go back to  less point than the champ. if you win, you keep your points and win the title. so next week, we will unveil the power championship and pac will be crowned inaugural champ. all people holding other championships and executive vice producers like the bucks, cody and omega can’t challenge for it. the title is unveiled and it is sexy as hell! with a white and gold colour pallet, and an aew logo with capital letters “power” underneath it. pac is handed over the belt and cuts a heel promo. the top  of the current power rankings show up on the screen in a graphic. sitting in second place is jon moxley with a -- record. moxley comes out and calls out pac to a non-title match for the main event. pac accepts. jimmy havoc also starts his weekly open challenge as a way for him to get points to face pac. he wins this match against jungle boy. moxley loses the match meaning him and moxley are tied. moxley uses this win as a way to challenge pac to a match at faith and misery. on the first episode of dynamite of , jimmy havoc manages to get equal points with moxley and pac! he uses this to make it a three-way match for the power championship! cody, to spice this match up even more! makes it a ladder match! we get a three-way brawl between all three men as they beat the hell out of each other! the go home week, aew air all three men exchanging video promos about the match to close the show. **faith and misery: pac vs. jon moxley vs. jimmy havoc – ladder match**in no particular order, the faith and misery card looks like this:lucha bros © vs. **lax –** aew tag team championships match jon moxley vs. pac © vs. jimmy havoc – ladder match for the aew power championship riho vs. ivelisse - aew women’s championship matchchris jericho © vs. **kenny omega** – aew world championship match cody vs**. marty scurll** – singles match yuka sakazaki vs. **bea priestley** – singles match**the young bucks** vs. private party – tag team match mjf vs. **adam page** vs. angelico vs. wardlow – four-way matchjimmy havoc starts off straight away jumping at pac and swinging punches at him. moxley breaks it up and starts to hammer down on pac and havoc. moxley hits a lariat to pac and begins to brawl with havoc. havoc rolls to the outside and grabs a ladder, but moxley hits a baseball slide to havoc, hitting the ladder to stun havoc. pac gets back up and hits a dropkick to the back of moxley sending him over the ropes! pac then hits a sommersault senton to the outside onto both men!! once everyone’s got to their feet, each man grabs a ladder and head into the ring.pac attempts to climb his ladder, but a double suplex off the side of the ladder prevents that. moxley and havoc brawl viciously. moxley hits a underhook ddt onto the apron! moxley goes to climb the ladder but meets pac on the top. they swing punches at each other, when pac ducks one, and hits a modified rock bottom off the ladder!!! jimmy havoc pulls out a trash can full of toys and the action really amps up. jimmy uses a steel chair to beat up mox. moxley wedges the chair into the corner, and hits a underhook suplex into the chair!! pac starts to brawl with havoc. pac goes for a lariat, but jimmy ducks, pac kicks off the chest of havoc and runs off the ropes, leap frogs havoc, then leap frogs again but comes down with a double foot stomp!

havoc looks like he’s about to knock pac off with a headbutt, but pac counters and hits a samoan drop through the table!! moxley takes this opportunity and grabs a bag of thumbtacks! he places it in the corner and wedges a ladder on the outside. jimmy havoc goes to climb the ladder, but moxley grabs him in a powerbomb position! he then powerbombs him through the ladder!!! pac pushes moxley into the ladder which busts him open!the final moments go like this. moxley and pac brawl in the ring until havoc gets to his feet. havoc is then busted open by moxley hitting him with a kendo stick over the head!!

moxley falls off and pac unhooks the title! pac retains and leaves with each man bleeding: havoc and moxley both busted open and pac cut on the back. **build to kingdome come:**pac cuts a promo the show after faith and misery basically talking about how he is the most deadly and fearless man on this roster, nobody can defeat him. he destroyed moxley and havoc, left them in a pool of there own blood as he rained supreme. over the rest of january, the rankings are edited as more wrestlers get wins and losses. by the end of the month darby allin is one win away from overtaking pac. darby allin finally overtakes pac on the january th episode of dynamite. the two stare down at the end of a show, exchange some words and go for each other! it ends with allin jumping off the railing with his skateboard, crashing over the back of pac!the next week they wrestle on the main event of dynamite. it continues the hard hitting and stiff action we’ve been seeing of the power championship. pac goes for a piledriver through the table, but allin avoids it. we get the insane allin moment, when he jumps off the top rope with a coffin drop through the announce table! pac uses allin’s one skateboard to assist a backbody drop followed by a red arrow to win the match!! after the match he says that he has been held down by everyone his whole life, now you’ve all seen what he can do. he’s not afraid to go extreme, he is not afraid of anything. all he wants is to destroy you, and nobody can stop him-luchasaurus music hits! luchasaurus has returned from injury! luchasaurus challenges pac to a match with marko stunt and jungle boy behind him backing him up. pac cuts a video promo continuing his “fearless” thing where he gets passionate and even yells about how he doesn’t show any fear. at kingdome come he’s willing to face anyone and luchasaurus is one of them. even if he’s  ft  and nearly  lbs he will still do to him what he did to jimmy havoc, jon moxley and darby allin. luchasaurus gets a hype package for himself also. at the end it announced his return match will be against wardlow next week, followed by a match with the young bucks the week after!luchasaurus and wardlow have a has fight for the ages to kick off luchasaurus return and kick off the show. after  minutes the time limit runs out, and with that wardlow is on equal points with pac! the next week pac takes on wardlow in a big man vs. little man match. after some exciting action containing fun spots and unique sequences, pac wins and breaks wardlow’s streak! meanwhile over in the jurassic world, luchasaurus teams up with jungle boy to take on the young bucks! the bucks put over private party last week so they’re not a cody and want to always win, so i think it’s not too farfetched for a boy and his dinosaur to go over. over the rest of february and early march luchasaurus gets wins every week, however jimmy havoc is also making advancements. two weeks before kingdom come, havoc and luchasaurus sit on equal points. a new jersey street fight is announced for that week’s dynamite. it’s a hard hitting and extreme match, with havoc even letting loose some bloodshed. luchasaurus hits a super powerbomb through a table to win the match and overtake pac in points. at this time, it’s also announced the champion can defend the title in other promotions at the champ’s request, and so pac defends the power championship at aaa rey de reyes against laredo kid! it’s a very flippy and hard-hitting match one by pac.the go home show sees pac cut a promo on luchasaurus. luchasaurus doesn’t appear since he’s still recovering from last week, however jungle boy and marko stunt do. they call out pac to a match, and pac tells them later in the night when he’s found a partner. cody comes out however and tells pac, “oh you don’t need to find a partner! we’ve got you one!” then afi’s – i hope you suffer ( [ ) hits, and we know, it’s jimmy fucking havoc. stunt and pac have a pose off, cause lol, but then have a really fast paced and fun match. pac wins, but doesn’t even look jimmy havoc in the eyes, who delivered the acid rainmaker for pac to a red arrow to jungle boy. **kingdome come: pac vs. luchasaurus – aew power championship** the kingdome come card looks like this:**kenny omega** vs. marty scurll – aew world championship match pac vs. luchasaurus – aew power championship match**lax** vs. private party – aew tag team championships match riho vs. **tessa blanchard** – aew women’s championship match kip sabian vs. **mjf –** singles match cody vs. **jon moxley** – no disqualification matchyuka sakazaki vs. **hikaru shida** vs. hana kimaru – three-way match **the inner circle** vs. the elite – six-man tag team match pac enters first in a super serious entrance. blue lighting floods the arena during his entrance to add a layer of cool. he holds the power championship high as he awaits luchasaurus. we hear sounds of the wild jungle, and men dressed as explorers enter the stage. they move around quietly, looking through their binoculars with weary yet curious looks on their faces. they all bunch up, and we hear a roar, as luchasaurus rises up and knocks all the men over!

luchasaurus rolls him into the ring and goes for the tomb-stone age, but pac lands on his feet, kick to the gut, shooting star double knee drop! pac heads to the top rope, red arrow! rings of saturn! luchasaurus taps out! pac retains!**build for double or nothing:**as a break i’d let luchasaurus and pac have the dynamite after kingdome come off but next week pac wrestles joey janela. after a good match, pac picks up the win. the rest of march sees the power rankings be changed by different wins and losses. by the end of march the power ranking sees pac at number , jimmy havoc at , luchasaurus at , mjf at  and kip sabian at . the next week pac cuts a promo where he trash talks all  of the other men. he calls out each and everyone one of them, which doesn’t exactly go down well with maxell jacob friedman, mjf. mjf makes his own promo on pac and all the other guys in the final four people. next week, a match between luchasaurus, kip sabian and mjf takes place where the winner takes on jimmy havoc next week, that person will then have enough points to face pac the week after. luchasaurus plays the powerhouse, kip sabian the high flying babyface and mjf the twatty twat twat heel. mjf gets the upset by hitting an out of nowhere finisher to kip sabian and picks up the win. next week is a battle of polar opposites, jimmy havoc and mjf. after  minutes or so, mjf once again gets the win. the final week mjf and pac each cut video promo on each other which are shown in a hype package. even though the match is heel vs. heel, it tells a good story. pac gets the win and truly seems unstoppable. pac starts to build this shield around him he is unstoppable. he promised he was and it’s coming true, nobody is able to stop the bastard. pac has a sit-down interview with jr next week. jr asks questions like *how did you first feel when you joined aew? what does the power championship mean to you? how do you feel about being unstoppable?* pac responds that the reason he is unstoppable is because nobody can beat him, nobody in aew has. he is ruthless, he is the most resistant, ruthless little bastard on the aew roster. the lights flash red and black for a few seconds, but go back to normal like nothing happened. this only makes pac more annoyed and makes him storm off. the next week, a dark and cryptic video promo is shown on dynamite, which talks about power, greed, hatred, violence. it’s basically jimmy havoc’s way of calling out pac without any words, and no sign of havoc. it ends with a call out for double or nothing, havoc vs. pac, slaughterhouse match ( deathmatch ). jimmy havoc opens the show teaming with joey janela vs. angelico and jack evans. havoc and janela win and later in the night pac face moxley. pac wins and after the match, jimmy havoc attacks pac with a kendo stick! he beats the hell out of pac, even tries to choke him with the kendo stick!next week the match is confirmed and jimmy havoc cuts a vicious and vulgar promo on pac. he says that every single day he has been underestimated. he lost his one and only title match without being pinned and all he’s been is cannon fodder since. who pisses him off the most in this company? that bastard called pac. that’s why at double or nothing ii, jimmy fuckin havoc is inviting pac to his house, the slaughterhouse. a deathmatch aew will never forget. over the next two weeks havoc manages to overtake pac in points by defeating both jack evans and jake hager in singles matches. pac and havoc exchange a war of words the go home week and let everything on their minds out about each other. it ends when both men get into a violent, chaotic and unkept brawl, ending with jimmy havoc knocking pac out with a kendo stick shot across the head! he stands over his prone body in full sadistic and psychotic jimmy havoc mode to close dynamite. **match:**the match opens with both men making their entrances. pac comes out in what is now is signature blue lighting with the power championship slung over his shoulder and an aggressive look on his face. sweaty, grimy unkept hair covers his face, bags under his eyes are clearly visible and a stone-faced expression on his face. jimmy havoc then comes out, wearing his thatched leather coat going down to his knees, and his mouth piece to conceal all facial expressions, all under a demonic red lighting. the two stare down before the referee rings the bell, havoc takes off his coat, but pac strikes him and our match is under way!havoc only has his coat off, yet is still wearing his mask and brawls with pac on the outside. they exchange elbows and punches with havoc using his mask as a way to headbutt pac. after some time he takes off the mask and they have some weapon based war. after some gruesome, at times hard to watch moments, weapons like: tables, chairs, kendo sticks, trash can, staple gun, light tubes, barbed wire, barbed wire boards and more, both men are coated in blood however the story is never taken away from. pac’s desperation to hold onto this belt, keep his streak, being pushed to the absolute limit and havoc’s one desperation to prove he is better than pac and win the title. in the end pac stands a bloody mess as havoc grabs is arm for the acid rainmaker. “do it!! i fucking dare you!!” as havoc hits it and goes for the cover. …..……!!!!!! jimmy havoc has won the power championship!!! pac lays in the ring, this  day reign and an entire run of being undefeated, all over as jimmy havoc holds the aew power championship high up. after the match the crowd clap in unison as pac walks up the ramp, an aew legend being solidified."

"tesla engineering has proved that to make the most efficient vehicle possible for its size, price, and purpose, vertical integration and consideration need to be taken for every aspect of the vehicle. you can't just have a generic skateboard you bolt a body on top of."
i live a  minute walk from where i work. i have been thinking of getting an electric skateboard- a quick google indicates these are illegal?!? how are they any riskier than if i bought a bike (have considered but a skateboard is a lot smaller to go in my flat). even though they are illegal is this likely to be an issue and what might happen if an officer caught me?thanks
"yea i don’t have as much experience on scooters, but you have two less wheels to it seems easier to crash. on an electric board the only real way to crash is to hit a something like a rock on the road. and without handle bars you can just run it out most of the time. of course if you are going over mph you are fucked no matter what. i have , miles on my board and have only crash twice so it is pretty safe as long as you know the roads and aren’t stupid."
"which is why e-scooters are more of a danger, it's not from a crash itself, it's the aftermath."
i get this.  i also get statements like “dont think about your ms and it wont bother you.”
what worked for me is becoming more independent with my mobility after i was able to buy whill ci electric scooter and creating new activities and hobbies for my self so i'm busy throughout the day. i also got a puppy so i rarely feel lonely this days.
"you're also going to need consumables. there's the obvious powder, primers, projectiles, of course. there's also maybe some new brass from time to time, and other stuff like a bottle of lemi-shine, lube, and probably replacement decapping/depriming pins, and so on. i'm not going to go into casting your own bullets, but that is an option too."
"this is probably a bad idea, but let's do a little math to guesstimate price-per-round. for example:"
"okay so, this is going to be a long story. i am looking for advice if possible, and i will be using fake names for privacy, so yeah. apologies in advance for grammar and punctuation errors.relevant background & the situation: i am currently in th grade and last year i became part of concrete friend group. there are four of us (all girls), being: lily, the talented visual artist and singer, who is also the innocent and responsible one. sophia, who is the big brain math nerd, comes off as entitled because her family is very rich, but is actually really honest and funny once you get to know her. ella, who is very smart, bisexual, singer and plays volleyball. oh, and me. i'm the funny one, bisexual, athletic (currently incapacitated due to bad skateboarding injury. haven't walked in four months, it sucks ass). and visual artist. so, to begin the story: in july of , i came out to ella as bi, and to my surprise she came out to me as bi too! i was planning to tell sophia and lily as well, however me and ella had a mutual agreement that we would tell them together. ella wasn't quite ready yet, however, so we waited a few months. because of this shared secret, we had a huge trust increase. we grew really close, and we became really close within our already tight friend group. in august i started developing some feelings for her. i tried to ignore them as best as i could, but they wouldn't go away. this continued in september, when we finally came out to lily and sophia, who were very supportive and proud of us. this crush started fading when ella started being observably critical, around mid-october. me, sophia, and lily all agreed on this. she has a bit of judgy personality as it is, but it was getting harder to ignore. during these few weeks, me and sophia had a brief stint of disliking her while lily wasn't so sure what to think. so, beginning of november and ella has gotten a lot better. lily and i both are trying to get things back to normal, but sophia still insists on this hate train. she thinks i'm % on her side, while in reality, i am on neither. i told her that ella has gotten better and that i no longer have any sort of grudge against her, and she half-agreed and half-ignored it. ella is oblivious to all of this, and i think we should just put it all in the past unless it starts again, or at least gently bring it up with her. so, the month of november passes and december is here. my crush really started to pick up in early december, and on some days the thought of her was the only thing that got me out of bed. i've been actively trying to be a little extra flirty with her, and honestly, she's been sending it back. there are some instances where she's held my glance for slightly too long, and she's been very touchy recently. i actually have a suspicion that she reciprocates my feelings! we've been getting along really well and the last class we had together was art, where we had two full scale laughing fits with laughter crying and we organized a horse funeral, which is an extremely obscure inside joke. it feels like we would work so well together, and i honestly feel like we have a chance at something here. however, i most definitely have my doubts about whether or not she likes me as well. she talks constantly of a girl on her volleyball team (the girl is gay, and ella, who is easily the most beautiful girl i've ever seen, definitely could get with her), adding that to the the way our friend group is structured, a romantic relationship would be very awkward and probably wouldn't work. i understand i am only in middle school, and i know it doesn't mean a lot to be in a relationship, but i can hope. high school seems more reasonable for us to date, as i'm sure our friend group won't be quite as close with each other. tl;dr: crush has been sending mixed signals, even if feelings were reciprocated friend group wouldn't allow itif you have advice whatsoever, please let me know! i'm willing to answer any questions needed, and i apologize if i did not provide enough information. thank you for reading and sorry for the length!"

"as a teenager there were dozens of times i had to hide under a bed or in a closet or in a bathroom shower and then sneak out back doors or climb out windows to escape when some girl's single parent came home from work.  sometimes it was exciting, like when you realize this hot girl's mom is also a ridiculously hot stripper, other times it was much less fun like when you realize this girl's dad who just rolled in is a cop and you are hiding in a closet praying he doesn't think you are a home intruder."
"results of my hubris: smashed $, phone with no insurance, bruise my entire side dark purple for a good minute, lost the beer, and felt like a fool. pluses include: i don't ride that any more and i quit drinking."
you do what feels right to you. but i once rode a scooter for like a min journey in the city and i never ever want to do that again. and i say that as someone who comfortably rides a bike in city traffic (in the same city even).
"before i start, english is not my native language so i’m sorry for any mistakes i make language-wise. last year in june, my life went into a one year of h*ll. my best friend of + years, dies in a climbing accident. i was lost, heartbroken and completely, utterly stricken with grief. thanks to my other two best friends, i managed to cope, get through it and went into heavy therapy. in january, one of the other ones dies in a electric scooter accident. he got hit from behind, and died on impact.i was devastated and wanted to die myself but the last best friend helped me through it. or we both helped each other through it i should say. our bond became even stronger due to the loss of two of our closest friends. that brings us to today. a little over one week ago, i got a friend calling like a lunatic. i was in a meeting so texted that i can’t answer. “you need to answer” was the text i got back. there has been a motorcycle accident and my third best friend has died as well. three of my + years best friends, all gone. i feel so extremely alone. depression kicking in, hysterical crying or extreme apathy. i live in norway, family and (what’s left) of my friends in sweden. i made the miles (km) drive home in utter shock and have no idea how i actually made it to my dads place. how do you cope? how can i get through this? what can i do? i just need some advice, any advice, i’m threading in deep water, trying to just keep my head above water. utterly heartbroken and the only feeling i feel is pain."

"“this shouldn’t be too hard, all we need to do is to get in a car and run her over. simple as that, right?” ravee stated, her eyes glancing over to one of the cars that looked relatively safe. “i can hotwire it and you can drive it.”"
"bicycles are allowed on the road in qld. as are skateboards and roller blades (providing you’re not occupying a bicycle lane) the issue is electrified things without the right adrs (headlights, tail lights, horn, as well as other safety features that would have to be added to pass adrs) that’s the issue."

i have a motorcycle helmet for riding but i also have a wolf king gt.  a bungie cord comes in handy for transportation of stuff. gloves with knuckle protection will definitely be your friend if you crash. and i almost always wear a skateboard shoe or no slip deck shoe.
in denmark some time ago it became a legal requirement to wear a helmet on an e-scooter but it's not a requirement on a bike and i kinda dislike that in part because of this irony.
"about six years ago i used an electric kick scooter (that i purchased myself) to commute five days each week. it was maybe an hour of riding per day in total. by the end of the year-ish i spent riding it to work, i was very good at riding electric scooters. i could jump it off curbs, weave through obstacles, all of that. my first week of using it, i crashed a couple times just trying to ride it down a bike path (due to turning too sharply, overestimating how fast i could slow down, etc)."

"so i am in the market for a new electric scooter, but i was shocked to learn about the prices. when i looked up taxes for electric vehicle they seemed to be very reasonable  percent-custom duty,  percent vat and rdt is . these showroom salesperson kept on stressing the point that percent cost belongs to the battery but the cost of battery has been going down over the past few years.segway e which looks very cheap is priced at whooping , niu is also very very expensive.these distributors are under the impression that nepali people have been paying high prices on ice vehicles that they will continue to pay high prices for ev. they are enjoying the tax benefit of ev and not passing down the benefit to the customer."
"i wear kevlar padded street motorcycle jacket and pants, a full-face motocross helmet, gloves, and hiking shoes when i plan on going fast (+ mph).  it's all a matter of what you want to protect and what you want to leave exposed to possible serious injury.  skateboard gear won't protect you at those speeds, and just imagine doing a fast faceplant on the road without a full-faced helmet."

helmets can be counterproductive because the kid doesn’t get the pain feedback from falls and thinks they can fall etc with out injury. they are not recommended for general use (good for scooters bikes etc) by pediatric pt’s etc.

emergency dismounts.  you will fall - a lot at first…learn how to do a controlled bail so you’re not dumping the euc every time you abort a maneuver.  this means having a plan to execute a maneuver and having a back up plan on what to do if you can’t.  for me this meant jumping off with both feet while simultaneous palming the trolley handle of my v so it stayed up.  my v has a motor disengage button under the handle so i couldn’t grab it (or it became a dead weight with no ability to balance fore or aft).

"i guess you just need to take it slowly. i bought my first skateboard a bit more than a year ago, with . never skated before. went with my oldest boy to the skate shop to buy him a skateboard for his birthday and thought ""why not? why should'nt i try it out myself?"". had no clue how difficult and time consuming it will be. tried to rush it, and after  months i ruptured my inner collateral ligament in my knee. had to pause for  months. first an so far only injury. i always wear a helmet an wrist pads. i learn much slower than a teen of course, still i overachieved what i hoped for. you are  - still much younger than me. you will learn it, if you stay committed! just be aware that it takes time!"

sex is legal.
it was minor accident and neither one of us got ran over by a car. a girl saw us and made sure to ask us if we were alright. i dont blame this other person for crashing into me. i just really hate to see inexperienced young people riding these electric vehicles irresponsably and the gov should severely restrict their use and maybe outright ban them from public use.
"my (m) son (m) is a good kid and loves to skateboard. he's actually pretty talented, and is even ""sponsored"" by the local skate shop. he's skated since he was . until he was  or so i always made him wear a helmet. he started resisting wearing a helmet around then, and while i would prefer that he does wear a helmet, i know i can't control every aspect of his life. by that point his body had learned how to fall ""correctly"" when he screws up a trick (i used to skate back in the day, if you skateboard you know what i mean). so i made a compromise with him - if he's just out street skating with his friends, he doesn't need to wear a helmet, but if he's at a park that requires it or is skating a bowl or half pipe, or if he's otherwise attempting something dangerous for the first time, then he needs to wear one. he readily agreed and has been good about wearing a helmet in those circumstances. anyway, a couple weeks ago my wife (f) was running an errand the other day and saw our son skateboarding, doing tricks down a small -stair set, and he wasn't wearing a helmet. she flipped out, pulled over, yelled at him in front of his friends and made him come home. now... it's not that my wife didn't know about my helmet ""rules"", but in her view what he was doing qualified as dangerous (he can ollie down stair sets almost x that size). she's never really loved that he's been into skateboarding (she always wanted him to do team sports) and as such, i don't think she fully appreciates how good he is for his age nor does she understand that he knows what his limits are and what he's doing. she is now insisting that he wear a helmet at all times much to my son's chagrin. i pointed out to her (privately) that this is ridiculous. he's at an age where he can make this choice himself, and on top of that, our daughter (f) who does cheer and gymnastics and doesn't have to wear a helmet despite head injuries being fairly common in those sports. to make my point, i got one of those cheerleader helmets and declared that she now needs to wear a helmet too since her brother has to now. our daughter is kind of a weirdo and to her credit thinks this is all pretty funny, and said something like ""i will be known as the helmet queen"" and started wearing it at practice. my wife is now freaking out because she doesn't want our daughter to stick out at games or competitions and make people think that she's special needs (yes, seriously she said that). my wife is saying i'm both undermining her and encouraging our son to do dangerous things, and that our daughter is going to get bullied for wearing a helmet. so aita?"

"i first noticed this issue a few years ago in a club, and have previously seen an ent doctor about this issue. i don't know how to perfectly describe it, so i apologize in advance if this is vague but i'll do my best.when i'm in a situation where i'm exposed to a noise source that is of a certain loudness or louder (at this point i would estimate  decibels) my hearing in my right will begin to become periodically distorted and static-y, with an acute feeling similar to slowly letting water into your inner ear while laying underwater. it's not necessarily painful, but it's annoying enough that it might as well be. the time it takes for this to start happening is directly related to the loudness of the environment, ranging from around ~ seconds in a concert situation, to ~- minutes while playing piano (though the later example has only started happening in the last few months). as far as i can tell it seems to be associated with the frequency range from about a (. hz) to c (. hz). once it has been happening for a while the threshold for what sustains the effect drops drastically, allowing even quietly played notes in that frequency range to continue to trigger it. the only relevant trauma i could think of was a skateboarding injury that happened a few months before i noticed the problem in which i hit the right (probably, the scar is under an eyebrow) side of my temple against the pavement, taring open my eyebrow and requiring stitches, but without getting a concussion. i don't frequently expose myself to really loud noise so i can't accurately pin down when the problem first started devolving, only when i noticed it.i've lived with this for over four years now because in the past, aside from a few specific situations and the time i spent in a prog metal band, it was largely a non-issue. i should be avoiding incredibly loud noise sources anyway. now in the last few months it is seriously messing with my ability to play and to practice piano, which isn't even all that loud % of the time, and through that starting to mess with the quality of my life. i deal with it, but it's annoying. i've tried earplugs, but they are horrible for playing piano, and only partially solve the problem anyway.i intend to go into my university's clinic when i find the time, however i don't want to walk away with the same result i had the last time i sought medical help. the doctor i saw was largely uninterested in helping me after he determined that i didn't have any hearing loss and said it was probably just a structural issue. there wasn't anything that he saw visibly wrong looking into my ear. so my questions are, what are your thoughts as to what this might be, and what questions or suggestions might you have that would help you/the doctor i will go to see in person determine what this issue might be?thank you for your help!"

"there are already many similar laws protecting drivers on the books. for example, laws and regulations requiring: crumple zones, seat belts, air bags, mirrors, firewalls, safe shatter windows, headlights, brakes and crash tests to be done on all passenger vehicles on the road. helmets aren’t required but you’re surrounded by a literal ton of steel and aluminum lined with airbags and crumple zones required by law to allow your fragile body to travel safer."
"james: felt, paint, and half a watermelon."
still needs a pack / module. it’s a structural pack. the entire pack provides rigidity to the car “skateboard”.  versus the current pack is not crash proof.  needs and exo frame to provide increased rigidity.
"i was biking down nd and a guy on an electric citibike ahead of me was about to bike around a bus, when some douche-canoe on his flying fuckstick of doom (e-scooter) plowed on through from the opposite direction at top speed, missing him quite literally by an inch. the citibiker stumbled so hard i thought they actually crashed for a second."
"personally i would not pull the moves you are pulling in the video because i feel like i don't have the reaction time i need. this isn't to say you're being unsafe, because you know your bike better than anyone else, and at any rate i fervently support all your lane-sharing as the ""face of normalization"" in the greater seattle area (most people who have started engaging in it refer to your influence and videos)"

"as the match begins, ravee and winona set their sights to the south, towards the pit stop. hopping onto persephone, winona and ravee will race towards the pit stop to get materials, winona slashing at any obstacles in the way to turn them into easily run-over gel. while winona drives, ravee will begin to lightly absorb energy from the bike at her usual dancing rate, and whenever her stand hits the c power limit she’ll move her feet apart from the bike before reconnecting them in order to gain more energy."

"it does not matter the number of cars that travel through an intersection or the average speed of a car from point a to point b. the metric that matters is how many people get through the intersection or how fast a person can get from point a to point b. bikes, scooters, skateboards or just walking can move huge numbers of people through an intersection with zero risk. buses and trains can get soo many people from point a to point b really fast. we don't care about your car problems, they are only problems with cars."

"hello everyone, i've been thinking about starting a rental business for eskates in our area. when we discussed this idea with a friend, he mentioned he knows a guy doing this in other city and he told me some of their boards got stolen. so it got us into thinking if there's any good off the shelf solution for tracking electric skateboards with gps. are you aware of any products for this?"

"i mean everyone knows they’re not lawfully able to be used on the road or pavement. i see them all over the place and the police don’t appear to give a shit. did you just think, “bugger it, i’ll get one anyway”? i’m not being judgmental, it’s just not in my mindset."
i see in the comments what you refuse to accept as an answer. i'm not going to get into a debate on that topic when you won't hear it. the thing to do is provide for the assumption you made and test it cheaply as possible.
i just bought a skatebolt tornado  in college and am a little nervous about it getting stolen. i am looking into buying a lock for the skateboard that i can attach to a bike stand. any recommendation for doing this?  i'm also considering buying an apple airtag and putting it somewhere inside of the battery casing area. any experience with his? i want to adhere it somewhere on the inside of the casing under the deck but i'm not entirely sure how to do this.
"hi fellow skaters. i've been skating for  months now but  of them injured.  month with a shoulder injury falling off a ledge and another month with dislocated  toes. i feel like i'm injuring myself more than normal. so any advice on preventing injuries or your stories about how you got injured and what you did to recover etc is greatly appreciated.fyi: i warm up, do stretches everytime before skating. i usually wear helmets and pads but it didn't protect my shoulder or toes lol"
"if red wants to begin this battle with bullets, ravee intends to shut down those dreams quickly. ravee first creates a gap in her shooting by throwing some kind of kinetic projectile like a rock or piece of metal to temporarily distract her. if she’s not shooting at them then they’ll goad her into firing with ravee preparing to activate  years as soon as she looks to start to fire, capitalising on her fury of winning by pointing out how she’s likely lost the race. she’ll use any opening in which she’s not shooting to goad her into  as red fires at ravee with intent to kill, she’ll soon learn how dangerous  years of pain really is as ravee will invert the bullet’s trajectory, as well as any grenades lobbed at her, along the path back towards red. while this is happening, winona can also lob projectiles from up above in an arc at the same time, blocking any attempt red might make to dodge the bullets and ensuring she gets struck by her own attacks or winona’s fiery rock and shrapnel shots. any time that red makes a duck for cover, ravee will duck back and heal back up with winona, using sotw to do so as well as healing up any cracks in the ground caused by  years. additionally, if the ground becomes too unstable for her to take a stance on, then ravee will unleash a blast of energy with  years and duck back and/or take off on the hubcap board, looking for a new spot to continue this section. this technique of reversing attacks will be known as vadi kata [tala]."

you can ignore reaction time because it will apply to both. or if you want to include add to both. either way the double electronic brakes on a scooter are much more effective than a road bike. the links match my real world experience and my road bike has disc brakes and wider gravel tires which would make it one of the better stopping bikes in any case.

i think you should skip a suspension wheel for a first wheel although there’s a very good argument to say come back to that decision once you’re proficient and know the lay of the land a little better.  we have a guy on the heavier side in our riding group and he rides a monster pro seated for hundreds upon hundreds of miles.  brings an ev charger with and an inflateable mattress and just chills while he charges.

thanks mate. this was actually an avulsion (where the tendon tears the bone off) and the second time i've had this injury - last time was on the right ankle  years ago. :/

"hi all, this might be a long one, with multiple questions. i just got my first board (minus a skateboard i had when i was like  that i rode for a total of like  hours) about a month ago. it's a db longboards mini cooper "". i've mostly been using it to commute around campus. but there are also a few spots on campus that, when nobody is walking to class, are really fun to cruise down and carve through with some speed regulation. there is one spot i was actually accidentally power sliding through which sent me flying (though landing on my feet running) even though the wheels are a hardness. i eventually i figured out it was because of a layer of dirt on the asphalt from some construction on campus."

i trained for a longboard skate marathon. it forced me to alternate my board foot. my bad ankle got to be my board foot and my pushing foot.
from an article about the accident:
"m’whitelbs.yesterday i fell off my skateboard. backwards onto my left arm. my arm was over extended over my head as i fell (imagine falling towards your left side with your arm straight up). it was from just a few inches off the ground.i immediately went home and iced it. experiencing some swelling and pain. bought a sling  hours later and have been resting it in it. the shoulder still has most mobility, but hurts to do most motions. most of the pain is in the back of the shoulder, more precisely behind the ball of my shoulder, if that makes sense.i have insurance but still trying to avoid the doctor because i’m afraid i can’t afford what i may have to go through just to have someone say, “just rest and ice it is all you can really do.”from what i’ve looked up on the internet, sounds like that may be the only thing to do if it’s a shoulder sprain. but torn rotator cuff may need more than that? i’m not too sure.thank you for your help and for reading this far. hope i provided enough detail."
"[] for instance, electric micromobility vehicles (elio, electra meccanica, aptera, ampere, arcimoto etc) often don't have a steering column so there's nothing to collapse, it doesn't have a large front end so you can't design it as a crumple zone, and a regulated airbag for these smaller, sub- pound  or  seaters, actually makes a collision more dangerous. it should have some safety regulation, of course, but the ones on a  pound -seater toyota camry simply do not apply here. same thing with ebikes (which have a assist limit of mph but you can easily buy a w one that goes  and nobody will stop you, plus you can manually pedal on top to go even faster) - a + mph bike does sound like some safety should exist that goes beyond the regulations surrounding bicycles but right now it's ""use a helmet and don't crash"""

acl / meniscus surgery about  years ago after hard fall from onewheel electric skateboard.  was up and active in normal recovery time through pt that started immediately after surgery.   within couple months i was back to % physically but no where near mentally.  took quite some time to get back to my old self and not fear re-injury.  i've since got back on the board and ride daily.  less aggressive but i am also getting up there in age and not trying to prove anything to myself anymore and just have fun again.
"did i manage to go on my long rides with my girlfriend? the answer is yes. in fact, because of the uphill improvements, the onewheel handled the hills way better than the scooter and was able to last longer. at the end of the ride, i was pushing the scooter while riding… fun times :)"
"may th, , i was walking home from work early in the morning, after bars closed. i don't own a car, but i'd found luck asking groups of people, as they were heading home, what part of town they were driving to, and could usually find myself a ride home. otherwise, it was a  mile walk.that night, i didn't get lucky. just the opposite, actually. i asked a group of men if they were heading towards my side of town, and they told me that they were from out of town, and didn't know where i was talking about... suddenly, there was a gun in my face and they were demanding my wallet.long story short, i lost my wallet, my glasses, and i got shot in the leg. the next couple of months were a blur. i'd been prescribed tylenol , hydrocodone, and several muscle relaxers and nerve suppressants. i moved back in with my parents, and made the living room couch my new home. i couldn't stay awake long enough to finish just one episode of a show, and i would wake up  or four hours later in extreme pain, just to take more painkillers and pass out. months after the incident, my prescriptions had run out... and i really didn't want any more. the pain was at a more tolerable level, but i'd only just begun to walk again. i got my computer set up, and started playing video games again. someone i met in a garrys mod server mentioned that he uses kratom for any skateboarding injuries that ibuprofen can't handle. i took his recommendation, and ordered myself an ounce, not expecting much from it. my dosage was low then, but i was amazed. it worked. it brought me the same pain relief that the prescriptions had, without the groggy, sedative effect that opiates brought along. i was able to stay awake all day, and sleep with fewer interruptions at night. i never got the euphoria or ""high"" that others have described (though i have found that effect since, in different vendors and strains). i took kratom all throughout physical therapy, up until the point that they didn't think i was going to make any more progress. i was walking, though with a very stiff leg, and a good amount of pain, even with kratom - i'd rate it at  out of .as of today, my pain has improved considerably. when i'm not using kratom, it's probably a . out of . but i used to be a chef... on my feet for  hours a day, doing my best fast walk to get around the kitchen without wasting any time. when i'm using kratom, i don't feel much pain in my day to day activities, unless i decide to sprint a couple of blocks to catch a rare pokemon when i'm out hunting... and that pain sets in the next day, hard.recently i've been thinking that i might be able to withstand being on my legs all day, speeding around the kitchen, and being able to do the work that i love. now that kratom is being scheduled... i'm not so confident anymore. i'm going to go a couple of days without kratom just to see where my pain level is, but i don't have high hopes. looks like i'm going to have to keep searching for a desk job.tl;dr - got shot in the leg. kratom has been my pain management for almost a year now. without it, i'm afraid that i'll never be able to go back to the career i love, because i just can't be on my legs all day. fuck you, dea."
"i've noticed that i don't want to use weed as much since i started microdosing. i still vape a tiny bowl in the morning for my seizures and don't feel anything but one day i decided to vape a few bowls after taking my md dosages (.-.) and i felt like i was on a baby trip, if that makes sense. with my eyes open, everything was normal. i just felt kinda high. when i closed my eyes though, it was trippy af. i saw an elephant/giraffe mix taking a huge dump by a beautiful waterfall, i saw this cute dachshund with deformed legs go rolling by me and i thought he was sitting on a skateboard but he had wheels implanted in his legs and he was so happy just rolling around, i watched a german shepherd morph into  other breeds of dogs, i talked to a few of my dead relatives, etc. it was awesome! it lasted about  hours. i was tired after that and usually i don't crash on my md, but worth it. i have never done a macrodose and had been sorta afraid of doing one, but now i can't wait. i'm going to a friends lakehouse in a few weeks and plan on sitting on the dock and tripping for a while."

it's generally harder to fall off a bike. most people riding bikes are in more control than most people who ride electric longboards. the types of injuries are different too. i think you're more likely to land on the back of your head coming off a board.
electric scooter accidents are primarily caused by the failure to wear proper riding gear. see [**the top  electric scooter accidents and their solutions in this post.**](
"if you fall off you now have several kgs of uncontrolled ""projectile"" heading for bystanders who didn't head out this morning prepared for a scooter injury."
"so grateful for this test series, thank you ireland. see you on the pitch."
i work out fairly regularly and would co sided myself in good shape. i recently became intrigued with crossfit and would be willing to give it a go though i have limited range of motion in my right wrist from and old skateboarding injury. for example i cannot do push-ups on my palms i must use my fist. however i have enough range of motion to be able to do a barbell overhead press. i am comfortable in a gym hitting any machine or workout i just have to adjust for the injury which sometimes means keeping my wrist as stiff and straight as possible which can at times hinder my ability to lift heavier i am worried i may be unable to pull off something like a snatch or front squat due to the range of motion needed in both wristswondering if anyone else has a similar issue and has developed workarounds? ??i’d really like to give crossfit a shot but if i’m at a risk for reinjuring my already gimpy wrist or if i can’t give it my all then i don’t want to do it.i feel like i could really excel in the sport
i’ve been in bad pain for the past few years after a car crash and some bad skateboarding injuries and wanna know if there’s a way i can find someone who would atleast more likely prescribe me something so i don’t have to waste thousands of dollars and years of my time to maybe be able to get some mg hydrocodone for a few weeks before they kick me off because the dea are up everyone’s ass now.
"i used to skateboard and i used to race dirt bikes. some of the best times in my life were spent doing those things. i'm  and i have quit both due to the injury risks involved. i'm super lucky that i was never seriously hurt with motorcycles, but i was constantly hurt skateboarding. no broken bones, somehow, but more rolled ankles and hematomas than any man should experience."
"electric bike or electric skateboard, had a onewheel xr that i loved to death with miles but got a seriously bad injury when it flew me off like superman and it made me rethink about using one and i sold it, and i’ve definitely had other falls on it before, not safe if you’re trying to go even mph it you’ll just be cruising at - mph to be safe, which is boring lol"
"making a u-turn from the far left-hand lane where the driver can see clearly for  feet in either direction, and the maneuver is executed in a manner that does not substantially increase the likelihood of injury or death. (cal. veh. code § .). .sleeping in car. (s.f. trans. code § )"
hmm i just looked into the spa/sea platform. disappointing that it's fwd in the  wheel drive layout.

"i'm basically wondering if anyone knows of some good resources for this topic. medical journals, websites, anything really. even if you talked about what you think are some of the most common ones; that would still be great. i'm trying to narrow down my subject matter seeing as there are plenty of ways to injure yourself skating."
"being a car guy is awesome, being a car guy with an electric car hasn't been as much fun but it's getting better. there's more and more people each weekend more curious than hostile. more questions than sneers. i get it's not your thing and that's okay. i'd encourage you to go to your nearest supercharger sometime or ask around in your facebook car group, you might encounter an owner who's a weiner but most are like me i love giving people rides and changing opinions."
